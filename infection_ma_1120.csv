We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis study to assess the possible association between H. pylori infection and PE and this is the first meta-analysis to clarify this issue. Methods: PubMed, ISI (Web of Science), SCOPUS, and Google Scholar databases were searched (up to April 2017) to identify the relevant studies. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines were used to do this study. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis model. Heterogeneity was assessed with the £q2-based Q-test and I2 statistic. Results: A total of eight studies including 889 participants (460 preeclamptic women and 429 controls) met the eligibility criteria. A positive association was found between H. pylori infection and PE (OR: 3.35; 95% CI: 2.21¡V5.10). Heterogeneity was acceptable (£q2 = 13.39; I2 = 47.7, 95% CI: 0¡V77). In subgroup analysis, cytotoxin-associated antigen A seropositivity was a substantial risk factor for PE when immunoblotting methods (OR: 11.12; 95% CI: 5.34¡V23.16; £q2 = 6.42; I2 = 53.3, 95% CI: 0¡V85) were used, whereas it was not potential risk factor for PE when ELISA was used as a detecting method (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.6¡V2.06; £q2 = 1.83; I2 = 0, 95% CI: 0¡V90). Conclusions: This study indicated that women with H. pylori infection, especially those infected with Cag A positive strains are more likely to have PE compared with the uninfected women. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Some evidence supports Helicobacter pylori infection as a trigger or driving event, but detection and eradication of H. pylori are not part of PD management. The aims of this case-control study and meta-analysis were to determine (i) the prevalence of H. pylori infection in PD patients, (ii) associations between H. pylori infection and clinical status, and (iii) differences in motor status in PD patients before and after H. pylori eradication. A literature search was performed using the PubMed database. The prevalence of H. pylori infection in PD, its association with the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS), and the association of H. pylori eradication therapy with the UPDRS-III score were determined by calculating the odds ratios (OR) and the standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Fixed- and random-effects models were applied. Ten studies were included in the first meta-analysis (5043 PD patients, 23,449 HCs); H. pylori infection prevalence was higher in PD patients than in HCs [OR (95% CI): 1.47 (1.27, 1.70), Pz&lt;0.00001]. In seven studies reporting UPDRS scores (150 H. pylori infected, 228 non-infected PD patients), there was a significant association between H. pylori infection and mean UPDRS scores [SMD (95% CI): 0.33 (0.12, 0.54), Pz = 0.003]. Regarding H. pylori eradication, in five studies (90 PD patients), there was a significant reduction in UPDRS-III scores after treatment [SMD (95% CI): 6.83 (2.29, 11.38), Pz = 0.003]. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis revealed a higher prevalence of H. pylori infection in PD patients suggesting that H. pylori may contribute to PD pathophysiology. In addition, the significantly lower UPDRS scores in non-infected PD patients and in patients after H. pylori eradication therapy demonstrate that the infection may deteriorate the clinical severity of the disease. ? 2018"

Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition¡Vinfection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition¡Vinfection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition¡Vinfection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition¡Vinfection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host¡Vparasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS"

This systematic review was conducted with the aim of estimating the pooled prevalence of lungworm infection in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Besides, it examines the predictors thought to be responsible for heterogeneity noted between the reports. The search databases used were PubMed, CAB direct, AJOL and Web of science. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty two studies published between 2000 and 2016 were found eligible and data were generated on 14,257 small ruminants (12,310 sheep and 1947 goats). Predictors including the study area, type of small ruminants affected, parasitic species involved, a diagnostic test used, study design, management systems, breed, agroecology, and year article published were used as milestone of data extraction. The statistical tool employed were meta-analysis, univariable and multivariable meta-regression and Egger's and begg's statistics for sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the estimated pooled prevalence of lung worm infection in small ruminants was 40.8% (95% CI: 36.1, 45.6) with a very high heterogeneity between the study reports (I2 = 96.5%). However, diagnostic test used and administrative States were the only two predictors identified to explain 15.5% of the explainable heterogeneity (R2 = 0.1545, tau2 unexplained = 0.6032, tau2 total = 0.7135) noted between studies. The reviewed studies showed that three genera of lungworms, namely Dictyocaulus filaria, Mullerius capillaris and Protostrogylus rufescens were prevalent both in sheep and goats in Ethiopia. Mixed infection with two or three species was reported in 4.4 to 48.6% of the total infected animals. Indeed this review is informative and provides a better picture on lungworm infection in Ethiopia; however, it is not exhaustively detailed as there was lack of clear data on the role of some important factors like age, flock size, management system and seasonal variation on lungworm infection. Thus, thorough epidemiological studies including all seasons are required for formulation of meaning full control strategies. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V."

The objective of this review is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI) in transplant candidates. Methods: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS were searched until 30 June 2017. The prevalence of LTBI was estimated using the random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated by subgroup analysis. Data were analyzed by STATA version 14. Results: The pooled prevalence of LTBI based on tuberculin skin test (TST) in different transplant types was as follows: liver 24% (14%¡V33%, 95% CI), lung 22% (18%¡V26%), renal 21% (16%¡V27%, 95% CI) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) 14% (9%¡V19%). The prevalence of LTBI based on Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) tests in renal transplant candidates was 31% (95% CI; 25¡V37%), which was much higher than the prevalence of LTBI in liver transplant candidates (25%, 95% CI; 17¡V33%) and HCT transplant candidates (13%, 95% CI; 10¡V16%) and there was statistically significant differences between them. The pooled prevalence of indeterminate results based on IGRAs test in different transplant types was as follows: renal 6% (4%¡V8%, 95% CI) and liver 12% (2%¡V21%, 95% CI). Subgroup analysis revealed that there were statistically significant differences between the overall prevalence of indeterminate results by using IGRA tests in liver transplant candidates (12%, 95% CI; 2¡V21%) and renal transplant candidates (6%, 95% CI; 4¡V8%). The pooled prevalence of post-transplant TB was 2% (1%¡V2%, 95% CI) and its occurrence was more common in renal recipients (4% (2%¡V7%, 95% CI)) than in the liver transplant patients (1% (0%¡V2%, 95% CI)). The prevalence of LTBI in the subgroup (i.e. the patients' mean age was <50 years) was significantly higher than the prevalence of LTBI by using TST/IGRAs in the other subgroup (i.e. the patients¡¦ mean age was ?50 years). Conclusion: Our study suggests fair overall agreement between IGRAs and TST in patients requiring liver and HCT transplantation, while a superiority of IGRAs over TST in patients requiring renal transplantation was seen. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Whether coating CVCs under bundles could further reduce the incidence of CRBSIs is unclear. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of implementing the use of bundles with antimicrobial-coated CVCs for preventing catheter-related blood-stream infections. Methods: In this systematic review and network meta-analyses, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library in addition to the EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for studies published before July 2017. The primary outcome was the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days, and the secondary outcome was the incidence of catheter colonization. Results: Twenty-three studies revealed significant differences in the rate of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days between antimicrobial-impregnated and standard CVCs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53¡V0.91, p = 0.008). Thirty-three trials were included containing 10,464 patients who received one of four types of CVCs. Compared with a standard catheter, chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine- and antibiotic-coated catheters were associated with lower numbers of CRBSIs per 1000 catheter-days (ORs and 95% CrIs: 0.64 (0.40¡V0.955) and 0.53 (0.25¡V0.95), respectively) and a lower incidence of catheter colonization (ORs and 95% CrIs: 0.44 (0.34¡V0.56) and 0.30 (0.20¡V0.46), respectively). Conclusions: Outcomes are superior for catheters impregnated with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine or other antibiotics than for standard catheters in preventing CRBSIs and catheter colonization under bundles. Compared with silver ion-impregnated CVCs, chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine antiseptic catheters resulted in fewer cases of microbial colonization of the catheter but did not reduce CRBSIs. ? 2018, The Author(s)."

Consecutive women with histologically verified CIN and observational management were included. Histologic findings of initial and follow-up visits were collected and persistence, progression and regression rates at end of observational period were assessed. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was performed. In 783 women CIN I, II, and III was diagnosed by colposcopically guided biopsy in 42.5%, 26.6% and 30.9%, respectively. Younger patients had higher rates of regression (p < 0.001) and complete remission (< 0.001) and lower rates of progression (p = 0.003). Among women aged < 25, 25 < 30, 30 < 35, 35 < 40 years, and > 40 years, regression rates were 44.7%, 33.7%, 30.9%, 27.3%, and 24.9%, respectively. Pooled analysis of published data showed similar results. Multivariable analysis showed that with each five years of age, the odds for regression reduced by 21% (p < 0.001) independently of CIN grade (p < 0.001), and presence of HPV high-risk infection (p < 0.001). Patient's age has a considerable influence on the natural history of CIN - independent of CIN grade and HPV high-risk infection. Observational management should be considered for selected young patients with CIN. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Methods: A systematic literature review of relevant articles published on ¡¥S. aureus isolates with intermediate resistance to vancomycin in Iran¡¦ was performed in PubMed and Scopus databases in the period 2010¡V2017. Results: From 335 records found in the electronic search, 40 related studies were included in the current analysis. This systematic review indicated that the overall prevalence rate of VISA was 0.09% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00¡V0.20] in Iran in 2010¡V2017. In the classification of VISA based on location, the highest frequency was in Mazandaran Province at 8.36% (95% CI 0.00¡V18.49%). The most prevalent VISA genotypes in Iran were staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type III, accessory gene regulator (agr) group II, sequence type 22 (ST22) and staphylococcal protein A (spa) type t790. Conclusions: Regarding the upward trend in the incidence of VISA strains in Iran and the importance of preventing VISA in public health, it is recommended to control nosocomial infections and to be cautious in the use of vancomycin. ? 2018 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer"

The high risk of micronutrients deficiency, including selenium, in TB patients is of great concern because it increases the risk of death. However, it is not clear whether selenium supplementation could improve the treatment outcomes in TB patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide an update on the existing evidence about low selenium levels in TB patients. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, EMBASE, Medline and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease were searched to identify observational studies on selenium and TB published up until April 2018. Studies comparing blood selenium levels in TB patients to controls were included. Data extraction was performed by two investigators. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Random effects analysis was performed to calculate the pooled effect size and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Of the 605 studies initially identified, only six were eligible. Of them, four were carried out in Asia, and one each in Africa and South America. The random pooled effect size was 1.6 (CI: 0.9, 2.4). This means that the probability is 160% for an individual with TB to have low levels of selenium as compared to an individual without TB. Heterogeneity across the studies was substantial (I2 = 95.1%). Potential sources of heterogeneity included study design and selenium measurement methods. Conclusion: Our review provides compelling evidence that serum selenium is lower in TB patients as compared with controls. Therefore, it is advisable to individually assess selenium status in TB patients and decide whether selenium supplement is needed or not. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH"

We performed a systematic meta-analysis to investigate the magnitude and direction of sex differences in immunity and to identify factors that shape sex-biased immunocompetence. In addition to considering taxonomic and methodological effects as moderators, we assessed age-related effects, which are predicted to occur if sex differences in immunity are due to sex-specific resource allocation trade-offs with reproduction. In a meta-analysis of 584 effects from 124 studies, we found that females exhibit a significantly stronger immune response than do males, but the effect size is relatively small, and became non-significant after controlling for phylogeny. Female-biased immunity was more pronounced in adult than immature animals. More recently published studies did not report significantly smaller effect sizes. Among taxonomic and methodological subsets of the data, some of the largest effect sizes were in insects, further supporting previous suggestions that testosterone is not the only potential driver of sex differences in immunity. Our findings challenge the notion of pervasive biases towards female-biased immunity and the role of testosterone in driving these differences. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS"

While recent studies provide further new information on pregnancy-related outcomes, their results are heterogeneous and a systematic meta-analysis may help the interpretation. The aim of this review was to analyze pregnancy-related outcomes in the recent literature on reflux nephropathy (2000¡V2016), to perfect the estimation of risks, and to identify specific research needs. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane review databases for the period 2000¡V2016 (PROSPERO registration no. 42016042713). Selection criteria: all case series and case reports dealing with reflux nephropathy and reporting on at least one pregnancy outcome. Data were extracted from eligible case series (? 6 cases). For the outcomes preeclampsia (PE), pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), preterm birth, and newborns small for gestational age, we employed as a control group the low-risk pregnancies from a multicenter database including 1418 live-born singletons. Case reports were analyzed narratively. Results: The search retrieved 2507 papers, of which 7 case series and 4 case reports were retained. The series report on 434 women with 879 pregnancies; no study reported controls. Compared to the low-risk controls, the meta-analysis showed an increased risk of PIH (odds ratio, OR 5.55; confidence interval, CI 3.56¡V8.66), PE (OR 6.04; CI 2.41¡V15.13), and all hypertensive disorders combined (OR 10.43; CI 6.90¡V15.75). No difference was observed in preterm delivery and caesarean sections. A higher incidence of stillbirth was reported in one paper. Conversely, the 4 case reports (on 10 pregnancies) alert us to a potentially severe complication, hydro(uretero)nephrosis with or without infection. Conclusion: Reflux nephropathy is associated with an increased risk of PIH and PE, but not of preterm delivery, suggesting the occurrence of late ¡¥maternal¡¦ PE. The finding of a higher incidence of stillbirths in one series requires further analysis.

This study thus estimates small ruminant and porcine trypanosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan African countries. It also describes Trypanosoma species prevalence in small ruminants and pigs and attempts identification of factors explaining between-study variations in prevalence. Articles reporting animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in sheep, goats, and pigs in countries within sub-Saharan Africa were retrieved from different databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online) and reference lists of relevant literatures. A total of 85 articles from 13 countries published between 1986 and 2018 were included in the analysis. Overall random-effects meta-analytic mean prevalence estimates were: 7.67% (95% CI: 5.22¡V10.49), 5.84% (95% CI: 3.81¡V8.23), and 19.46% (95% CI: 14.61¡V24.80) respectively, for sheep, goats, and pigs with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = &gt;95.00%. p &lt; 0.0001) noted between studies. Ovine, caprine, and porcine prevalence were highest in Tanzania (91.67%. 95% CI: 76.50¡V99.84), Equatorial Guinea (27%. 95% CI: 0¡V81.09), and Cameroon (47%. 95% CI: 29.67¡V66.06), respectively. Trypanosoma brucei s. l., T. vivax, and T. congolense were the most prevalent in the livestock. Trypanosoma brucei subspecies (T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense) occurred in all three livestock being mostly prevalent in pigs. Country of study was a significant predictor of trypanosomiasis prevalence in each livestock in addition to time and sample size for caprine hosts, diagnostic technique for both caprine and ovine hosts, and sample size for porcine hosts. The pattern of animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in the studied livestock reflects their susceptibility to trypanosomal infections and tsetse fly host feeding preferences. In conclusion, sheep, goats, and especially pigs are reservoirs of human infective trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, their inclusion in sleeping sickness control programmes could enhance the goal of the disease elimination. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V."

Objectives: A meta-analysis was carried out to evaluate their association. Methods: Comprehensive literature search of Pubmed, Web of Science and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was conducted. The strength of association between SDF-1 3¡¬A polymorphism and HIV-1 progression was evaluated using the pooled ORs and 95%CIs calculated under different comparison models. Subgroup analyses, heterogeneity, Galbraith plot analyses and test for publication bias were also carried out. Results: Our result showed that when compared with the typical progressors, the GA + AA and GA genotype of SDF-1 3¡¬A polymorphism was found positively associated with the long-term non-progressors (LTNP) in the Caucasian HIV-1 infectors (GA + AA vs. GG, OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02¡V2.18, p = 0.040; GA vs. GG, OR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.06¡V2.35, p = 0.024), while AA genotype was found significantly higher in Asian LTNPs (AA vs. GG + GA, OR = 3.32, 95% CI: 1.25¡V8.85, p = 0.016).

Although impervious plastic wound protectors have been used in surgery to reduce surgical site infection rates, the effectiveness of impervious plastic wound protectors for reduction of surgical site infections remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the clinical effectiveness of impervious plastic wound protectors in reducing surgical site infection rates after abdominal surgery. Methods: A systematic review of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to identify randomized clinical trials evaluating surgical site infection risk after abdominal surgeries with and without the use of impervious plastic wound protectors. The outcome of interest was a well-specified, clinically based definition of surgical site infections. No language or time restrictions were applied. The pooled risk ratio was estimated with random-effect meta-analysis. The quality assessment of the studies and the quantitative analyses were performed in line with the principles of the Cochrane Collaboration. Results: Of the 400 studies identified, 14 randomized controlled trials representing 2,684 patients were included in this review. The pooled risk ratio under a random-effects model was 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.51¡V0.96; I2, 56.8%), indicating a potentially significant benefit from impervious plastic wound protector use. There was a significant trend toward greater protective effect in studies using a dual ring protector (relative risk = 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.15¡V0.58), rather than a single ring protector (relative risk = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.71¡V1.00). There was no significant between-study heterogeneity or publication bias.

This systematic review and meta-analysis are to estimate the prevalence of HRSV infections in people with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI) in Africa. Method: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Africa Journal Online, and Global Index Medicus to identify observational studies published from January 1, 2000, to August 1, 2017. We used a random-effects model to estimate the prevalence across studies. Heterogeneity (I2) was assessed via the chi-square test on Cochran's Q statistic.

Sixty (90%), seven (10%), and no studies had low, moderate, and high risk of bias, respectively. The prevalence of HRSV infection varied widely (range 0.4%-60.4%). The pooled prevalence was 14.6% (95% CI 13.0-16.4, I2?=?98.8%). The prevalence was higher in children (18.5%; 95% CI 15.8-21.5) compared to adults (4.0%; 95% CI 2.2-6.1) and in people with severe respiratory tract infections (17.9%; 95% CI 15.8-20.1) compared to those with benign forms (9.4%; 95% CI 7.4-11.5); P-values &lt;0.0001. The HRSV prevalence was not associated with sex, subregion in Africa, setting, altitude, latitude, longitude, and seasonality. Conclusion: This study suggests a high prevalence of HRSV in people with ARTI in Africa, particularly among children and people with severe clinical form.

The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on the prevalence of Candida species in root canal infections. Methods: Extensive literature research was performed in the most important electronic biomedical databases, and additional studies have been identified from references from relevant articles. Studies were critically appraised using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. Results: From 2225 unique records, 2118 were excluded on the basis of title and abstract. Of the remaining 107 studies, 50 were excluded after full-text review, and 57 were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The overall prevalence of Candida spp. in root canal infections was 8.20% (95% confidence interval, 5.56%¡V11.21%). Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed (P &lt;.001, I2 = 86.07%). Subgroup analyses revealed a higher prevalence of Candida spp. from African samples. All studies considered, a high or unclear risk of bias was prevalent regarding 6 out of the 8 items considered in the critical appraisal.

Objective: We sought to examine data available from studies regarding contemporary risks of reused devices in comparison with new devices. Methods: We searched online indexing sites to identify recent studies. Peer-reviewed manuscripts reporting infection, malfunction, premature battery depletion, and device-related death with reused devices were included. The primary study outcome was the composite risk of infection, malfunction, premature battery depletion, and death. Secondary outcomes were the individual risks. Results: Nine observational studies (published 2009¡V2017) were identified totaling 2,302 devices (2,017 pacemakers, 285 defibrillators). Five controlled trials were included in meta-analysis (2,114 devices; 1,258 new vs 856 reused).

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of intravenous beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BL-BLI), including piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ), on mortality of participants with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections compared with carbapenem. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were electronically searched for studies through June 15, 2017 that have provided data for mortality and addressed the terms ¡§ESBL¡¨ and ¡§PTZ or BL-BLI¡¨ and ¡§carbapenem¡¨.

The diagnosis is complicated by non-specific symptoms and challenged by the variable accuracy of different imaging techniques. The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of various imaging techniques to diagnose VGI. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data sources included PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane from January 1997 until October 2017. Observational cohort studies were included. A meta-analysis was conducted on several imaging modalities: computed tomography with or without angiography (CT(A)), 18F-fluoro-D-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography with or without low dose or contrast enhanced CT (FDG-PET(/CT)), and white blood cell scintigraphy with or without single photon emission computed tomography combined with low dose CT (WBC (SPECT/CT)). Results: Of 4259 papers, 14 articles were included, containing eight prospective and six retrospective articles.

Pre- and post-test results showed that WBC SPECT/CT favours FDG-PET/CT, with a positive post-test probability of 96% versus 83%. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests the diagnostic performance of WBC scintigraphy combined with SPECT/CT is the greatest in diagnosing VGI. However, it is a time consuming technique and not always available. Therefore FDG-PET/CT may be favourable as the initial imaging technique.

Methods: The electronic literature database of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane library were searched in April 2018. The data on B?hler angle, Gissane angle, calcaneal width, calcaneal height, AOFAS hindfoot scores and complications (including wound edge necrosis, wound infection, deep infection, hematoma and sural nerve injury) were extracted. The Stata 14.0 software was used for the meta-analysis. Results: Nine studies including 6 RCTs and 3 retrospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. This meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the B?hler angle (P = 0.44), Gissane angle (P = 0.06), calcaneal width (P = 0.09) and calcaneal height (P = 0.44) postoperatively and at the last follow-up. However, the bone graft group had significantly higher AOFAS scores than the non-bone graft group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the two groups in complications (P = 0.63). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggested that operative treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures with bone grafts achieved better AOFAS scores than the non-bone graft group. The two groups had similar results in B?hler angle, Gissane angle, calcaneal width and calcaneal height. No increased risk of postoperative complications was identified.

We conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess CVD risk from recent and cumulative abacavir exposure. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, abstracts from Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, and International AIDS Society/AIDS Conferences and bibliographies of review articles to identify research studies published through 2018 on CVD risk associated with abacavir exposure among PLWH. Studies assessing risk of CVD associated with recent (exposure within last 6 months) or cumulative abacavir exposure across all age-groups were eligible. Risks were quantified using fixed- and random-effects models. Results: Of 378 unique citations, 68 full-text research articles and abstracts were reviewed. Seventeen studies assessed risk of CVD from recent or cumulative abacavir exposure. Summary relative risk (sRR) is increased for recent exposure (n=16 studies, sRR=1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.48¡V1.75), higher in antiretroviral-therapy-naive population (n=5, 1.91; 1.48¡V2.46) and all studies reported RR>1. The sRR for recent exposure was similarly increased for the outcome of acute myocardial infarction, and for studies that adjusted for substance abuse, smoking, prior CVD, traditional CVD risk factors, and CD4 cell-count/HIV viral load. The sRR was increased for cumulative abacavir exposure (per year) (n=4, 1.12; 1.05¡V1.20) but no increase was seen after adjusting for recent exposure (n=5, 1.00; 0.93¡V1.08). Conclusions: Our findings suggest an increased risk of CVD from recent abacavir exposure. The risk remained elevated after adjusting for potential confounders.

Nine studies containing 780 participants met the outlined inclusion criteria. Disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand scores significantly favoured volar locking plates, but only at 3 months was the difference clinically meaningful. Grip strength, extension, and supination were better in the volar locking plates group in the early post-operative period, but were similar at 12 months. Ulnar variance was better restored by volar locking plates. The volar locking plates group was associated with higher re-operation rate, and the external fixation group had a higher infection rate.

However, this approach remains controversial for a tooth with a periodontal or periapical lesion. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the treatment outcomes of immediate implant placement into extraction sockets with or without infection of periodontal or periapical origin in the esthetic zone and to provide treatment protocols based on current studies. Material and methods: An electronic search was performed in PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library between January 2009 and October 2017. A subsequent manual search included all clinical studies published in the English language and excluded any reviews or animal studies. An article quality assessment scale, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), was used to evaluate the quality of studies enrolled. The implant survival rate was expressed as risk ratio, whereas bone level changes and gingiva level changes were expressed as mean differences in millimeters with 95% confidence intervals.

Once the decision to prescribe an antimicrobial is made, the choice of antimicrobial should be based on both the benefits and adverse effects. This systematic review quantifies the occurrence of common adverse events (AEs) related to FQs in relation to any other antimicrobial for any indication in primary care. Methods: We searched randomized controlled trials from Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and CINHAL. FQs had to be administered orally, for any indication, to adults and in primary care. Data were extracted independently in standard forms in ¡§Covidence¡¨. Pooled estimates of the intervention effects for AEs were determined by the Peto odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in Revman. Results: In the 39 studies selected, the most commonly reported AEs were nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, and rash. A meta-analysis of 28 studies reporting AEs showed central nervous system (CNS)-related AEs (OR 1.40 (1.12-1.75) P = 0.003, heterogeneity (I2) = 0%) and gastrointestinal (GI)-related AEs (OR 1.20 (1.06-1.36) P = 0.005, I2 = 80%) were significantly associated with FQs compared with other antimicrobials. Compared with FQs, co-amoxiclav showed significantly more total AEs (OR 0.70 (0.54-0.90) P = 0.006, I2 = 78%) and GI-related AEs (OR 0.69 (0.52-0.91) P = 0.008, I2 = 94%).

However, it is toxic and of limited value in chronic infection. Objective: We aimed to estimate the rates of and factors related to adverse reactions (ARs) to benznidazole and treatment discontinuations (TDs). Methods: A meta-analysis was performed using an electronic search of the published literature with no language restrictions until June 2017. Prospective studies were included of chronically infected patients in which at least one treatment arm included benznidazole. Data were added from a prospective cohort of patients with Chagas disease at our centre (January 2007¡VJune 2017). Weighted rates of ARs and TDs were estimated, and potentially related factors were analysed. Results: Some 413 studies were found, from which we chose 42 (nine clinical trials and 33 observational studies, including ours), comprising data for 7822 patients. The weighted rate of ARs to benznidazole was 44.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 37.2¡V51.2). ARs were more frequent in adults than in children (51.6 vs. 24.5%), with the most common being skin reactions (34%), gastrointestinal complaints (12.6%) and neurological symptoms (11.5%). Grade 4 ARs were recorded in 3% of cases. The weighted rate of TDs was 11.4% (95% CI 8.5¡V14.5); TDs were more frequent in adults than in children (14.2 vs. 3.8%). In our cohort, only female sex was related to an increased rate of ARs but not to TDs. Conclusion: Benznidazole had a poor tolerability profile, with a high incidence of TDs, especially in adult patients and women.

The first aim of this study was to compare re-infection rates following knee arthrodesis for periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) with IM nail or EF. The second aim was to compare rates of radiographic union, complication, and re-operation as well as clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic search was performed in electronic databases for longitudinal studies of PJIs (minimum ten patients; minimum follow-up = 1 year) treated by knee arthrodesis with IM nail or EF. Studies were also required to report the rate of re-infection as an outcome measure. Eligible studies were meta-analyzed using random-effect models. Results: The rate (95% confidence intervals) of re-infection was 10.6% (95% CI 7.3 to 14.0) in IM nail arthrodesis studies. The corresponding re-infection rate for EF was 5.4% (95% CI 1.7 to 9.1). This difference was significant (p = 0.009). The use of IM nail resulted in more advantages than EF for frequency of major complications and limb shortening. Other postoperative clinical and radiographic outcomes were similar for both surgical strategies. Conclusions: The available evidence from the aggregate published data suggests that knee arthrodesis with EF in the specific context of PJI has a reduced risk of re-infection in comparison with the IM nail strategy. The use of IM nail is more effective for the complication rate and shortening of the affected limb. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

HCAI is associated with increased healthcare costs, owing primarily to increased hospital length of stay (LOS) but calculating these costs is complicated due to time-dependent bias. Accurate estimation of excess LOS due to HCAI is essential to ensure that we invest in cost-effective infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. Aim: To identify and review the main statistical methods that have been employed to estimate differential LOS between patients with, and without, HCAI; to highlight and discuss potential biases of all statistical approaches. Methods: A systematic review from 1997 to April 2017 was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest and EconLit databases. Studies were quality-assessed using an adapted Newcastle¡VOttawa Scale (NOS). Methods were categorized as time-fixed or time-varying, with the former exhibiting time-dependent bias. Two examples of meta-analysis were used to illustrate how estimates of excess LOS differ between different studies. Findings: Ninety-two studies with estimates on excess LOS were identified. The majority of articles employed time-fixed methods (75%). Studies using time-varying methods are of higher quality according to NOS. Studies using time-fixed methods overestimate additional LOS attributable to HCAI. Undertaking meta-analysis is challenging due to a variety of study designs and reporting styles. Study differences are further magnified by heterogeneous populations, case definitions, causative organisms, and susceptibilities. Conclusion: Methodologies have evolved over the last 20 years but there is still a significant body of evidence reliant upon time-fixed methods.

Methods: A comprehensive search up to 1 July 2017 was conducted on Medline and Embase for studies that utilized FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and Prodesse for diagnosis of viral respiratory infections. A summary of diagnostic accuracies for the following five viruses were calculated: influenza A virus (FluA), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus. Hierarchical summary receiver operating curves were used for estimating the viral detection performance per assay. Results: Twenty studies of 5510 patient samples were eligible for analysis. Multiplex PCRs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) equal to or more than 0.98 for all the above viruses except for adenovirus (AUROC 0.89). FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+ (the only Prodesse assay with enough data) demonstrated a summary sensitivity for FluA of 0.911 (95% confidence interval, 0.848¡V0.949), 0.949 (95% confidence interval, 0.882¡V0.979) and 0.954 (95% confidence interval, 0.871¡V0.985), respectively. The three mPCRs were comparable in terms of detection of FluA. Conclusions: Point estimates calculated from eligible studies showed that the three mPCRs (FilmArray, Verigene RV+ and ProFlu+) are highly accurate and may provide important diagnostic information for early identification of respiratory virus infections. In patients with low pretest probability for FluA, these three mPCRs can predict a low possibility of infection and may justify withholding empirical antiviral treatments. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

Only a few antibiotics active against resistant UTIs have been tested in randomised clinical trials, mainly aminoglycosides. The average point cure rate of all investigational drugs was estimated to 95.3% (95% CI 93.5¡V96.9%). Among 3002 patients for whom cure and failure rates were reported, only 3.9% (3.9%; 118/3002) were considered clinically to have treatment failure, while 135 (4.5%; 135/3002) had microbiological failure. Conclusions: We observed high treatment cure rates, regardless of the investigational drug chosen, the route of administration, duration and dosing. This suggests that future research should prioritise observational studies and clinical trials on children with multi-drug-resistant infections. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

Hence, we aimed to systematically compare the risk of adverse drug events observed with baricitinib 2?mg versus 4?mg for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Electronic databases including the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant English publications until April 2018. Adverse drug events at 12?weeks and 24?weeks were considered as the clinical endpoints. RevMan 5.3 software was used to analyze the data whereby risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Four trials consisting of a total of 959 participants were included in this analysis. At 12?weeks, no significant difference was observed between 2?mg and 4?mg baricitinib for serious adverse events (RR 1.33; 95% CI 0.63¡V2.78; p = 0.46), any adverse events after the start of therapy (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.98¡V1.21; p = 0.13), discontinuation of drugs due to adverse events (RR 1.19; 95% CI 0.61¡V2.34; p = 0.60), malignancies (RR 3.03; 95% CI 0.12¡V73.90; p = 0.50), and major adverse cardiac events (RR 2.95; 95% CI 0.12¡V71.91; p = 0.51). Infections including herpes zoster infections and serious infections were also similarly manifested. At 24?weeks, serious adverse events (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.02¡V3.30; p = 0.04) were significantly higher with baricitinib 4?mg compared with the 2-mg dosage. However, total adverse events after the start of therapy, discontinuation of drug due to adverse events, malignancies, major adverse cardiac events, infections including herpes zoster, and serious infections were not significantly different between the two doses. Conclusions: No significant differences in adverse drug events were observed between baricitinib 2?mg and 4?mg at 12?weeks¡¦ follow-up. However, this analysis showed the risk of serious adverse events to be significantly higher with baricitinib 4?mg compared with baricitinib 2?mg at 24?weeks¡¦ follow-up. This hypothesis should be confirmed in larger trials with longer follow-up time periods. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG."

However, the evidence and recommendations from some organizations remain controversial. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the efficacy of antimicrobial-coated sutures for preventing SSIs in digestive surgery. Methods: We performed a systematic review of literature published from 2000 to 2017 (registered on PROSPERO, No. CRD42017076780). We included studies defined as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (OBSs) for the prevention of SSIs and the reduction in hospital stay length associated with digestive surgery. Results: In the 10 RCTs, the incidence rates of incisional SSIs were 160/1798 (8.9%) with coated sutures and 205/1690 (12.1%) with non-coated sutures. Overall, antimicrobial-coated sutures were superior for reducing the incidence of incisional SSI (risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.48¡V0.94, p?= 0.02) in RCTs for digestive surgery with the mixed wound class and surgeries limited to a clean-contaminated wound (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44¡V0.98, p?= 0.04). A superior effect of antimicrobial-coated sutures was found in 9 RCTs that involved only colorectal surgeries (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49¡V0.98, p = 0.04). The mean hospital stay length was similar with coated or uncoated sutures in 5 RCTs involving colorectal surgery (mean difference (MD) ? 5.00, 95% CI 16.68¡V6.69, p = 0.4). Conclusion: Antimicrobial-coated sutures are significantly more efficacious for preventing SSIs during digestive and colorectal surgery, even when restricted to clean-contaminated wounds.

Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess the possibility of type I or II error and compute the information size required for conclusive meta-analysis. Results: We identified six randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies, enrolling a total of 1102 patients. The included populations in the PSC and LSC groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics. The risk of surgical site infection (SSI) was significantly lower in the PSC group (OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.06, 0.18; P < 0.00001). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of operative time (MD 1.80; 95% CI ? 1.35, 4.96; P = 0.26), anastomotic leak (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.21, 2.48; P = 0.61), incisional hernia (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.25, 1.37; P = 0.22), small bowel obstruction (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.50, 1.86; P = 0.91), and length of hospital stay (MD ? 0.04; 95% CI ? 0.51, 0.42; P = 0.86). Patient satisfaction was higher in the PSC group. TSA showed that the risk of type 1 error was minimal and meta-analysis was conclusive. Conclusions: PSC is associated with significantly lower risk of SSI and better patient satisfaction compared with LSC in closure of stomas and should be the closure technique of choice. The current available evidence is robust and conclusive highlighting that the results of the current study should be incorporated into clinical practice without a need for further trial data. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The objective of the present study was to compare the different patch materials that are currently available (synthetic vs venous vs bovine pericardium) in terms of short- and long-term outcomes. Methods: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and eligible randomized control trials were identified through a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central published until September 2017. A meta-analysis was conducted with the use of a random effects model. The I2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity. The primary study end point was the incidence of long-term restenosis. Secondary study end points were 30-day stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction, neck wound infection, local hematoma, carotid artery thrombosis, cranial nerve injury, long-term stroke incidence, and death. Results: Eighteen studies and 3234 patients were included.

A Meta-analysis,2018,World Journal of Surgery,10.1007/s00268-018-4603-0,,"Objective: To perform a meta-analysis to answer the question, whether early closure (EC) of defunctioning loop ileostomy may be beneficial for patient as compared with late closure (LC) without exceeding the risk of surgical-related morbidity. Design: Medline and the Cochrane Trials Register were searched for trials published up to November 2016 comparing EC (defined as ?14?days from the index operation in which the ileostomy was performed) versus LC for stoma closure after rectal surgery. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0. Inclusion criteria Main outcome measures: Overall morbidity rate, anastomotic leakage rate, and wound infection rate within 90?days after elective surgery. Results: Six studies were included and analyzed, yielding 570 patients (252 in EC group and 318 in LC). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the overall morbidity rate between the EC and LC groups (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.22¡V1.78; P = 0.38). Despite a significant higher wound infection rate of stoma site (OR 3.83; 95% CI 2.14¡V6.86; P < 0.00001), meta-analysis showed no significant difference in the anastomotic leakage rate between the EC and LC groups (OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.22¡V1.78; P = 0.38). Moreover, both stoma-related complications (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.24¡V0.86; P = 0.02) and small bowel obstruction rates (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.06¡V0.20; P < 0.00001) were significantly lower in the EC group than in the LC group, respectively. Limitations: Heterogeneity of the studies Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that EC of a defunctioning loop ileostomy is effective and safe in careful selected patients without increasing overall postoperative complications. This promising strategy should be proposed in patients in order to reduce stoma-related complications. ? 2018, Soci?t? Internationale de Chirurgie."

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of randomized controlled trials that assessed clinical outcomes (overall survival, transplant-related mortality, graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], veno-occlusive disease [VOD], interstitial pneumonitis, disease relapse, cytomegalovirus [CMV] infection and disease, non-CMV infection) of immunoglobulin prophylaxis versus placebo in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to June 2017. Quality of included studies and outcomes were evaluated via Risk of Bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria, respectively. RESULTS: Of 899 citations screened, 27 studies (n = 3934) were included. Immunoglobulin prophylaxis had no impact on survival (risk ratio [RR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.01; 11 studies, n = 1962) but decreased risk of acute GVHD (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65-0.94; eight studies, n = 1097) and CMV disease (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; two studies, n = 167). Meta-analysis revealed increased risk of VOD (RR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.10-8.41; three studies, n = 384) and disease relapse (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; seven studies, n = 1647). Other outcomes were small in sample size or nonsignificant. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the low quality of studies and evidence of outcomes. CONCLUSION: Immunoglobulin prophylaxis did not have a significant effect on survival. Positive clinical effects were shown for acute GVHD and CMV disease and negative effects against VOD and disease relapse. No studies examined the effect of immunoglobulin treatment in hypogammaglobulinemic patients despite current guidelines, warranting further studies in this population. ? 2018 AABB"

Study selection: A systematic search strategy was conducted using MeSH terms and pre-defined criteria. Two groups of researchers searched Pubmed, CENTRAL, Embase (English, German), Ichushi-web (Japanese) as well as hand searching. Data were extracted independently by the two groups. The estimated frequency of abutment tooth loss was calculated from data on the number of lost teeth and exposure time. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the annual frequency of abutment tooth loss across all included studies. Results: A total of 4791 eligible studies from PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL. An additional 316 articles were identified from the Ichushi-Web plus another 131 articles from additional sources. From those manuscripts, 19 reported relevant outcome data that was then extracted. The pooled data included a total of 1954 abutment teeth with a combined total exposure time of 9098 years. The estimated linear rate of loss was 1.76 %/year (95 %CI 1.13; 2.72). Caries and periodontal infections were identified as the most common reasons for abutment tooth loss. Conclusions: Natural tooth retained overdentures often constitute the last resort before edentulism and might aid in this transition, especially in very old patients with reduced adaptive capacities. Given correct design, preparation and aftercare, RODs with cast copings, still are a valid treatment option in partially edentulous patients. ? 2018 Japan Prosthodontic Society"

However, there is a paucity of clinical evidence on the clinical impact of this strategy in pneumonia patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). This review aimed to evaluate the impact of antibiotic de-escalation therapy for adult patients diagnosed with pneumonia in the ICU. Methods used to conduct the review: This review was conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendation. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Databases and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to March 2017 for relevant trials. The methodological quality of included trials was assessed by using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Case-Control and Cohort Studies. A meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effect model to combine the rate of mortality and length of stay outcomes. Findings of the review: Nine observational trials involving 2128 patients were considered eligible for inclusion. Although based on low quality evidence, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of the impact of de-escalation on hospital stay but not mortality (MD ?5.96?days; 95% CI ?8.39 to ?3.52). Interpretations and implications of the findings: This review highlights the need for more rigorous studies to be carried out before a firm conclusion on the benefit of de-escalation therapy is supported. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Method The authors systematically searched PubMed/ MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (last search March 2017) for RCTs in adult patients with subacute cough. The authors considered trials evaluating any outcome of any drug or non-drug treatments, apart from traditional Chinese and Asian medicines. They combined treatment effects on cough-related outcomes in random effects meta-analyses. Results Six eligible RCTs including 724 patients were identified. These assessed montelukast, salbutamol plus ipratropium bromide, gelatine, fluticasone propionate, budesonide, and nociception opioid 1 receptor agonist and codeine. Five studies reported effects on various cough severity scores at various timepoints. No treatment option was associated with a clear benefit on cough recovery or other patient-relevant outcomes in any of the studies or in meta-analyses for cough outcomes at 14 days and 28 days. Reported adverse events were rather mild and reported for 14% of patients across all treatments. Conclusion Evidence on treatment options for subacute cough is weak.

New strategies are urgently required. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) treatment in patients with ACLF associated with hepatitis B virus infection. Materials and methods The MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for the relevant publications. If appropriate, a meta-analysis was carried out for the following outcomes: Survival rate, model for end-stage liver disease score, and liver function. Results Three studies were eligible for the present systematic review. A total of 198 hepatitis B virus-ACLF patients were enrolled for this review. Ninety-one patients were treated with MSC and 107 patients were treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) as controls. Pooled results showed that MSC treatment could significantly reduce the mortality rate at week 12 [risk ratio: 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 0.76; P=0.00009] and the mortality rate at the final follow-up (risk ratio: 0.54; 95%CI: 0.37, 0.78; P=0.001) compared with the SMT group. Furthermore, pooled estimates showed that MSC treatment could significantly reduce the total bilirubin level at week 4 (mean difference: 58.89; 95%CI: 14.47, 103.32; P=0.009) compared with the SMT group.

Materials and Methods: Systematic literature searches were performed to identify studies reporting on geriatric subjects with dental implants and on implant patients who had any of the seven most common systematic conditions among geriatric patients. Meta-analyses were performed on the postloading implant survival rates. The impact of systemic medical conditions and their respective treatment was qualitatively analyzed. Results: A total of 6,893 studies were identified; of those, 60 studies were included. The fixed-effects model revealed an overall implant survival of 97.3% (95% CI: 94.3, 98.7; studies?=?7) and 96.1% (95% CI: 87.3, 98.9; studies?=?3), for 1 and 5?years, respectively. In patients with cardiovascular disease, implant survival may be similar or higher compared to healthy patients. High implant survival rates were reported for patients with Parkinson's disease or diabetes mellitus type II. In patients with cancer, implant survival is negatively affected, namely by radiotherapy. Patients with bone metastases receiving high-dose antiresorptive therapy (ART) carry a high risk for complications after implant surgery. Implant survival was reported to be high in patients receiving low-dose ART for treatment of osteoporosis. No evidence was found on implant survival in patients with dementia, respiratory diseases, liver cirrhosis, or osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Implant prostheses in geriatric subjects are a predictable treatment option with a very high rate of implant survival.

We searched the national and international online databases of MagIran, IranMedex, SID, MedLib, IranDoc, Scopus, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar search engine for certain MeSH keywords until June 16, 2017. In addition, heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and publication bias were performed. The data were analyzed using random-effects model and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2 and P value was considered lower than 0.05. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis in 11 surveyed articles that assessed 2864 pregnant Iranian women was 8.74% [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.40-13.84]. The prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis was estimated 5.73% (95% CI: 2.09-14.73) and 13.55% (95% CI: 11.23-16.25) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively which the difference was not significant (P=0.082).

Human immunodeficiency virus increases the pathological effect of hepatitis viruses and potentiates re-activation of latent hepatitis infections as a result of reduced immunity. Because of the same modes of transmission shared by the two infections, HBV represents an important cause of co-morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV; hence, the aim of this review is to determine the prevalence of HBV among people living with HIV. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis will include cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies of patients positive for HBV and HIV irrespective of their countries. All pertinent articles published on hepatitis B in people living with HIV from January 1, 1990, to July 31, 2017, without any language restriction will be searched in PubMed/MEDLINE, Global Index Medicus Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica Database. Two review authors will independently assess the relevance of all titles and abstracts identified from the electronic searches. The study-specific estimates will be pooled through a random-effects meta-analysis model to obtain an overall summary estimate of the prevalence of HBV across studies. We will assess statistical heterogeneity and pool clinically homogeneous studies. On the other hand, we will evaluate statistical heterogeneity by the chi-squared test on Cochrane's Q statistic. Symmetry of funnel plots and Egger's test will be used to detect the presence of publication and selective reporting bias. In the case of publication bias, we will report estimates after adjustment on publication bias using the trim-and-fill method. We will assess inter-rater agreement between investigators for study inclusion, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment using Kappa Cohen's coefficient. This protocol will comply with the guidelines for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis protocol to report the prevalence of HBV in people living with HIV. We believe its outcomes will be of utility in providing insights on the characteristics of HBV epidemic in people living with HIV, and draw more attention of public health services to this association.

This study is a meta-analysis on the prevalence of Campylobacter in fresh vegetables and fruits without any location limitation, which was performed through a documented review of the available resources. Relevant literature was reviewed by trained reviewers, who examined the results for the inclusion of articles in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of Campylobacter in raw vegetables, the sample source, the Campylobacter species, and the method of detection were extracted. The prevalence of Campylobacter in vegetables, fruits, and fresh produce were estimated to be 0.53%. Analysis of the various sample groups initially showed that the bean and sprouts group was the vegetable with the highest prevalence of Campylobacter (11.08%). The rate of contamination was higher when both the molecular and conventional methods were employed. The highest prevalence of Campylobacter was found in Asia (33.4%). Despite the low prevalence, consumption of raw vegetables is inherently risky because no treatment is used to inactivate the pathogens. Therefore, proper sanitation methods are recommended to treat the raw products. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

On the other hand, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection is also of known burden. Determining prevalence measures of these viruses is crucial for establishing appropriate country specific strategies regarding prevention, diagnosis, and containment. This systematic review was aimed to provide pooled seroprevalence estimates of the three viruses in Sudan. Structured review of the literature was conducted to obtain relevant studies published in both national and international databases. After assessment of quality and bias in all proposed studies, 57 prevalence studies were included. Meta-analysis was conducted for all studies and subgroup analysis was also approached. The total sample size of participants in included studies providing HIV antibodies prevalence was 15,479. Based on information retrieved from these studies, HIV prevalence ranged from 0 to 18.3% among different study populations. However, pooled prevalence estimate for HIV antibodies was 1%. Kassala, Eastern Sudan was the most endemic State (4.18%). The HBV reported seroprevalence rates ranged from 5.1 up to 26.81% among different populations and the overall pooled prevalence was 12.07%. For HCV antibodies; 2.74% was determined to be the pooled prevalence. Khartoum State was the most endemic State of both HBV and HCV with seroprevalence of 12.69% and 6.78%, respectively. Based on data reviewed and synthesized; there is no evidence for an HIV endemic in the general population of Sudan. However, both HBV and HCV seroprevalence rates are indicating otherwise.

Although pneumococcal vaccination is highly recommended for those patients, the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination in this population remains largely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this PROSPERO-registered systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor £\ (TNF£\), or rituximab, on the initial serologic response to pneumococcal vaccination in patients with auto-immune disease. Methods: We included 22 articles comprising 2077 patients, of whom 1623 were treated with immunosuppressive agents, and 454 were controls. Results and discussion: The findings of our systematic review indicate that, in patients treated with immunosuppressive medication and compared to controls, the initial serologic response to pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) are impaired. Moreover, this impaired response was more profound after PCV than after PPSV. We hypothesize that the immunosuppressive medication mainly compromises the cellular immunity, explaining the more severely reduced response rate to PCV (which induces a T-cell dependent immune response), compared to PPSV. Treatment with TNF£\ blocking agents was associated with a more favorable response, compared to patients treated with other immunosuppressive medication. Targeted research applying uniform correlates of protection is needed to bridge the knowledge gap in vaccination immunology in this patient group.

Methods: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched for eligible randomized controlled studies (RCTs) published before June 30, 2017. Meta-analyses of odds ratios were performed along with subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results: Twenty-one RCTs were included. In comparison with placebo, LMWH treatment was associated with a lower risk of VTE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (P values < 0.001) but similar risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (P = 0.227) in THR subjects. Compared to factor Xa inhibitors, LMWH treatment was associated with higher risk of VTE in TKR subjects (P < 0.001), and higher DVT risk (P < 0.001) but similar risk of PE and major bleeding in both THR and TKR. The risk of either VTE, DVT, PE, or major bleeding was similar between LMWH and direct thrombin inhibitors in both THR and TKR, but major bleeding was lower with LMWH in patients who underwent THR (P = 0.048).

However, subgroup analysis showed indiscriminate genotype HPV infection increased the ratio of spontaneous abortion with OR of 2.24 (95% CI 1.37-3.65), while HR-HPV infection had no significant effect (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.21-1.98). The results indicated that HR-HPV infection was a risk for sPTB with a pooled OR of 2.84 (95% CI 1.95-4.14). HPV infection was found to be independent of the ART-based clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64-1.70) and spontaneous abortion of ART pregnancy (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.86-2.50). Conclusions: Indiscriminate HPV genotype infection can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and HR-HPV infection was a risk factor for sPTB. However, there was not enough evidence to indicate the association between HPV infection and pregnancy rate of ART, and spontaneous abortion of ART pregnancy. Different genotypes of HPV infection may play a discrepant role in adverse pregnancy outcomes. ? 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel."

This systematic review and meta-analysis provides updated information on risk factors for P. aeruginosa infection in Asia-Pacific as well as the consequences (e.g. mortality, costs) of initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy (IIAT). Methods: Embase and MEDLINE databases were searched for Asia-Pacific studies reporting the consequences of IIAT versus initial appropriate antimicrobial therapy (IAAT) in Gram-negative bacterial infections as well as risk factors for serious P. aeruginosa infection. A meta-analysis of unadjusted mortality was performed using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 22 studies reporting mortality and 13 reporting risk factors were identified. The meta-analysis demonstrated that mortality was significantly lower in patients receiving IAAT versus IIAT, with a 67% reduction observed for 28- or 30-day all-cause mortality (odds ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.20¡V0.55; P < 0.001). Risk factors for serious P. aeruginosa infection include previous exposure to antimicrobials, mechanical ventilation and previous hospitalisation. Conclusion: High rates of antimicrobial resistance in Asia-Pacific as well as the increased mortality associated with IIAT and the presence of risk factors for serious infection highlight the importance of access to newer and appropriate antimicrobials. ? 2018 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer"

METHODS: This meta-analysis involved randomized clinical trials of NPWT compared with non-NPWT on surgical wound healing. The main outcome was surgical site infections; secondary outcomes were dehiscence, seroma/hematoma, skin necrosis/blistering, bleeding, and reoperation. MAIN RESULTS: Seventeen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 928 NPWT and 930 non-NPWT patients. Compared with non-NPWT, NPWT was not associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-1.24). The reduction in wound dehiscence, seroma/hematoma, skin necrosis/blistering, and bleeding in the NPWT group was significant compared with that in the non-NPWT groups. Significant heterogeneity was observed in seroma/hematoma and skin necrosis/blistering between the NPWT and non-NPWT groups. No publication bias was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-NPWT, NPWT significantly reduced the rates of dehiscence, seroma/hematoma, skin necrosis\blistering, and bleeding, but not surgical site infections. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, and Africa Journal Online with no language restriction to identify articles published from Jan 1996 until Dec 2017. We considered observational studies conducted in apparently healthy populations (pregnant women, blood donors, and general population). We used a random-effects model to pool data. Results: We included 24 studies (23,295 participants) from seven of the ten regions in Cameroon. Four, 20, and no studies had low, moderate, and high risk of bias respectively. The overall HBV-HIV coinfection prevalence was 0.8% (95%CI 0.5¡V1.0; 11 studies). The overall HBV prevalence in people with HIV was 12.9% (95%CI 9.7¡V16.5; 20 studies). The HBV prevalence in people with HIV was significantly higher in rural compared to urban. No study reported the prevalence of HIV infection in people with HBV. Conclusions: Although we found a low prevalence of HIV-HBV coinfection in Cameroon, this study presented a high HBV prevalence in people with HIV.

In China, both HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening coverages are low. We aim to investigate the temporal and geographical trends of HPV DNA prevalence in heterosexual men, women, men who have sex with men (MSM) and people living with HIV (PLHIV) in China. Methods: We conducted a systematic review, collecting publications in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data from January 2000 to May 2017. A total of 247 studies were selected for this meta-analysis to estimate pooled HPV prevalence, incidence of cervical cancer and risk of infection for subgroups. Meta-regression was applied to identify contributing factors to prevalence heterogeneities. Results: The national HPV prevalence was 15.6% (95% CI (14.4% to 16.9%)) in women with normal cervical cytology, and Central China had the highest prevalence (20.5% (15.2% to 25.8%)). HPV prevalence in heterosexual men (14.5% (11.3% to 17.7%)) was comparable with that of women (OR=1.09 (0.98 to 1.17)), but HPV prevalence in MSM (59.9% (52.2% to 67.6%)) was significantly higher than that in heterosexual men (OR=8.81 (8.01 to 9.69)).

Methods: RCTs comparing ethanol lock with another solution lock for prevention of CRBSI were obtained by searching databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials for eligible randomized controlled trials (inception to December 2017). Two researchers separately selected the RCTs and assessed their quality. Data on patient characteristics and ethanol protocols were collected. The primary outcome was the incidence of CRBSI, and the secondary outcomes were catheter colonization, exit infection and thrombosis. Results: A total of 2575 patients with 3375 catheters from 7 eligible RCTs were included. Overall, ethanol lock significantly decreased the risk of CRBSI, with RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.38¡V0.78; I2 = 0%; p = 0.001); no obvious heterogeneity was observed in the fixed-effects model (I2 = 0%). Of note, subgroup analysis demonstrated that ethanol lock conferred significant benefit in studies with tunneled catheters (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.30¡V0.72) but not in studies with untunneled catheters. Only two studies provided data regarding catheter colonization, and no significant difference was found (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.87¡V1.38; I2 = 41%; p = 0.45). Moreover, pooled data did not show significant differences between ethanol and control groups with regard to the incidence of thrombosis (RR 1.05; 95% CI 0.91¡V1.22; I2 = 0%; p = 0.48).

However, the overall utility of such therapy is uncertain and data comparing induction protocols are limited. The authors searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov through January 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational controlled studies of IT vs no IT and IL2RA vs ATG. Inverse variance fixed effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure were used for primary analyses. Main outcomes include moderate and severe rejection, all-cause mortality, infection, and cancer. The authors¡¦ search retrieved 2449 studies, of which 11 met criteria for inclusion (8 RCTs and 3 observational case-control studies). Quality of evidence for RCTs was moderate to high. Overall, patients receiving IT had similar risk of moderate-to-severe rejection, all-cause death, infection, and cancer with patients who did not receive IT. The use of IL2RA was associated with significantly higher risk of moderate-to-severe rejection than ATG (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.4 to 8.1), but similar risk of death, infections, and cancer. The use of IT was not associated with any benefits or harms compared with no IT.

The aim of the study reported here was to compare the efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis versus that of non-prophylaxis in resolved HBV-infected patients undergoing chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy. Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the ClinicalTrials.gov website were searched from inception until December 2017. Studies comparing reactivation in prophylaxis versus non-prophylaxis in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy were included.

We performed a systematic literature review to generate estimates of pathogen transfer in relation to healthcare provider (HCP) activities.Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis, Medline/Ovid, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published before July 7, 2017. We reviewed the literature, examining transfer of pathogens associated with HCP activities. We included studies that (1) quantified transfer of pathogens from a defined origin to a defined destination surface; (2) reported a microbiological sampling technique; and (3) described the associated activity leading to transfer. For studies reporting transfer frequencies, we extracted data and calculated the estimated proportion using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation and the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model.Results Of 13,121 identified articles, 32 were included. Most articles (n=27, 84%) examined transfer from patients and their environment to HCP hands, gloves, and gowns, with an estimated proportion for transfer frequency of 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12%-57%), 30% (95% CI, 23%-38%) and 10% (95% CI, 6%-14%), respectively. Other articles addressed transfer involving the hospital environment and medical devices. Risk factor analyses in 12 studies suggested higher transfer frequencies after contact with moist body sites (n=7), longer duration of care (n=5), and care of patients with an invasive device (n=3).Conclusions Recognizing the heterogeneity in study designs, the available evidence suggests that pathogen transfer to HCPs occurs frequently.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Mortality Rates of Inpatients with Cellulitis,2018,Journal of General Internal Medicine,10.1007/s11606-018-4546-z,,"Background: Cellulitis is a common cause of hospitalization. In the USA, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code ¡§other cellulitis and abscess¡¨ accounts for 1.4% of all admissions and $5.5 billion in annual costs. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends hospitalization for patients with cellulitis under certain circumstances but there is little actual clinical evidence to guide the decision to admit. The purpose of this study is to determine the mortality rate of patients hospitalized with cellulitis and to ascertain if the rate is comparable to the rate for low risk patients with community acquired pneumonia that are currently recommended for outpatient management. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of consecutive patients hospitalized with cellulitis or erysipelas that reported inpatient mortality. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The mortality rates from the included studies were pooled using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic. Results: Eighteen studies met inclusion criteria. The overall worldwide mortality rate was 1.1% (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7¡V1.8). For studies from the USA, the rate was 0.5% (95% CI 0.3¡V0.9). The actual cause of death was generally poorly described, and only one third of deaths appeared to be due to infection. Discussion: The estimated mortality rate for patients currently being hospitalized for cellulitis is comparable to the mortality rate of patients with community-acquired pneumonia that are recommended for outpatient management by the Pneumonia Severity Index and CURB65 prediction models and strongly endorsed by major infectious disease societies.

Serotype-independent vaccines that are economically viable species of common protein antigens such as whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) are needed. Considering the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of WCVs, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of WCVs against colonization in mice. Material and methods: A systematic review was undertaken of published studies on the protection (colonized/uncolonized) of whole cell pneumococcal vaccine in mice. The search terms used were ¡§whole cell vaccine¡¨ and ¡§Streptococcus pneumoniae¡¨ in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus engines. Data was extracted from original publications and a meta-analysis was performed on studies divided into sub-groups by the number of inoculations, type of sample, type of adjuvant, time of sampling, design of study and quality of study. Results: Ten eligible articles published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this review. The meta-analysis was performed on eight out of 10 studies and demonstrated that the estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for comparison of colonization between the vaccinated and unvaccinated mice for outcomes 1 and 2 were 0.18 and 0.24, respectively. Lower RRs were observed in sub-groups that were inoculated with vaccines three times, those using cholera toxin (CT) adjuvants and those obtained as tracheal specimens from the mice. Conclusions: The best protocol for use of a WCV is its application with CT adjuvant administered intranasally in three inoculations at doses of 10? CFU.

Methods: The electronic literature database of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane library were searched in January 2018. The data operation time, intraoperative blood loss, follow-up knee function (Rasmussen score, HSS) and complications (including infection, screw loosening, knee stiffness, knee instability, posttraumatic osteoarthritis, VTE) were extracted. Stata 12.0 software was used for our meta-analysis. Results: 11 RCTs and 6 prospective comparative studies met our inclusion criteria with 358 tibial plateau fractures patients in the 3D group and 378 patients in the routine ORIF group. The meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences in operation time, intraoperative blood loss and bony union time between the 3D group and conventional group. As for the complications and follow-up function recovery evaluated by the excellent and good rate based on HSS and Rasmussen score, no significant differences were found. Conclusion: The 3D group showed shorter operation time, less intraoperative blood loss and faster union time for patients with tibial plateau fractures. Therefore, compared with conventional ORIF, ORIF assisted by three-dimensional printing technology should be a more appropriate treatment of tibial plateau fractures.

Methods: Multiple databases (PubMed, Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify studies comparing the outcomes of RAPD and open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD) or RADP and open distal pancreatectomy (ODP) (up to December 31, 2017). Fixed and random effects models were applied according to different conditions. Results: Fifteen non-randomized controlled trials (11 RAPD vs. OPD and 4 RADP vs. ODP) involving 3690 patients were included. Robot-assisted surgery had longer operative time (RAPD vs. OPD: P = 0.0005; RADP vs. ODP: P < 0.00001) but lesser blood loss than open surgery (RAPD vs. OPD: P = 0.0009; RADP vs. ODP: P = 0.0007). RAPD was associated with less wound infection, a lower positive margin rate, lower overall complications, and faster postoperative off-bed activity. There was no significant difference in the lymph node yield, the rate of pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, reoperation, length of hospital stay and mortality between the two groups. Compared with ODP, RADP was associated with less blood transfusion, fewer lymph nodes harvested, lower complications and shorter hospital stay. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of spleen preservation, positive margin, pancreatic fistula, and mortality. Conclusions: Robot-assisted surgery is a safe and feasible alternative to OPD and ODP with regard to perioperative outcomes. However, due to the lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials, the evidence is still limited. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

This meta-analysis evaluated the short-term (12¡V16 weeks) efficacy and safety of biologics targeting IL-17 and IL-23 in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Twenty-one randomized clinical trials met the defined inclusion criteria. Our results showed that Ixekizumab (160 mg wk0 + 80 mg q2w) had the greatest probability of achieving both PASI 75 (RR 21.32, 95% CI 15.48¡V29.36, P < 0.00001) and PASI 90 response (RR 59.76, 95% CI 32.41¡V110.19, P < 0.00001) at the primary endpoint times, followed by Ustekinumab and Secukinumab. Regarding the safety profile, Tildtakizumab (200 mg, q4w) was safest (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78¡V0.99, P = 0.04), while Ixekizumab (160 mg wk0 + 80 mg q2w) showed highest risk for one or more AE (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.15¡V1.38, P < 0.00001). However, there was no significant difference between the two biologics regarding one or more SAEs. Comparing to the biologics targeting IL-23, the pooled effect size favored the biological agents targeting IL-17 in terms of the PASI 75 (PASI 75: RR 17.28, 95% CI 14.51¡V20.58, P < 0.00001) and PASI 90 (RR 37.19, 95% CI 26.91¡V51.41, P < 0.00001). The rate of overall AEs was significantly higher (P < 0.00001) in biologics targeting the IL-17 (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12¡V1.24, P < 0.00001) compared to biologics targeting IL-23 (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91¡V1.04, P = 0.44), and with respect to one or more SAEs, no difference was seen between biologics targeting IL-17 and IL-23. This meta-analysis found that Ixekizumab was the most effective short-term treatment, but was ranked as the most risk therapeutic choice among the biologics involved in this study, while Tildtakizumab was the best alternative in the case of safety. Furthermore, it demonstrated that biologics inhibiting IL-17 were superior to biologics targeting IL-23 in terms of the efficacy, but posed higher risk at the same time.

Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic. However, ketamine cautiously needs to be administered in ECT due to the possibility of increased risk of side effects. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched. Observed outcomes included: gestational age at birth (weeks), amount of blood loss (L), units of red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfused, length of stay in hospital and the intensive care unit (ICU) (days), urinary tract injury and infection. Only studies reporting the occurrence of any of the explored outcomes in women with a prenatal compared with an intrapartum diagnosis of AIP were considered eligible for inclusion. Random-effect head-to-head meta-analyses were used to analyze the data. Results: Thirteen studies were included. Women with a prenatal diagnosis of AIP had less blood loss during surgery (mean difference (MD), ?0.87; 95% CI, ?1.5 to ?0.23), had fewer units of RBC (MD, ?1.45; 95% CI, ?2.9 to ?0.04) and FFP (MD, ?1.73; 95% CI, ?3.3 to ?0.2) transfused, and delivered earlier (MD, 1.33 weeks; 95% CI, ?2.23 to ?0.43) compared with those with an intrapartum diagnosis. The risk of admission to an ICU and length of in-hospital and in-ICU stay were not different between the groups. Prenatal diagnosis of AIP was associated with a higher risk of urinary-tract injury (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3¡V4.6), mainly due to the higher prevalence of placenta percreta in the group with AIP diagnosed prenatally. Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of AIP is associated with reduced hemorrhagic morbidity compared with cases in which such anomalies are detected at delivery. Copyright ? 2018 ISUOG.

Aim of the study is to compare the outcome of SLC with conventional multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (MLC) in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials only. Methods: A systematic Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials literature search of articles on SLC and MLC for any indication was performed in June 2017. The main outcomes measured were overall adverse events, pain score (VAS), cosmetic results, quality of life, and incisional hernias. Linear regression was used to model the effect of each procedure on the different outcomes. Results: Forty-six trials were included and data from 5141 participants were analysed; 2444 underwent SLC and 2697 MLC, respectively. Mortality reported was nil in both treatment groups. Overall adverse events were higher in the SLC group (RR 1.41; p < 0.001) compared to MLC group, as well severe adverse events (RR 2.06; p < 0.001) and even mild adverse events (RR 1.23; p = 0.041). This was confirmed also when only trials including 4-port techniques (RR 1.37, p = 0.004) or 3-port techniques were considered (RR 1.89, p = 0.020). The pain score showed a standardized mean difference (SMD) of ? 0.36 (p < 0.001) in favour of SLC. Cosmetic outcome by time point scored a SMD of 1.49 (p < 0.001) in favour of SLC. Incisional hernias occurred more frequently (RR 2.97, p = 0.005) in the SLC group. Conclusions: Despite SLC offers a better cosmetic outcome and reduction of pain, the consistent higher rate of adverse events, both severe and mild, together with the higher rate of incisional hernias, should suggest to reconsider the application of single incision techniques when performing cholecystectomy with the existing technology. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

This patient-level meta-analysis based on 11 randomized trials investigates the impact of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy on mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with infection, both overall and stratified according to sepsis definition, severity, and type of infection. Methods: For this meta-analysis focusing on procalcitonin-guided antibiotic management in critically ill patients with sepsis of any type, in February 2018 we updated the database of a previous individual patient data meta-analysis which was limited to patients with respiratory infections only. We used individual patient data from 11 trials that randomly assigned patients to receive antibiotics based on procalcitonin levels (the ""procalcitonin-guided"" group) or the current standard of care (the ""controls""). The primary endpoint was mortality within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were duration of antibiotic treatment and length of stay. Results: Mortality in the 2252 procalcitonin-guided patients was significantly lower compared with the 2230 control group patients (21.1% vs 23.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 0.99; p = 0.03). These effects on mortality persisted in a subgroup of patients meeting the sepsis 3 definition and based on the severity of sepsis (assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, occurrence of septic shock or renal failure, and need for vasopressor or ventilatory support) and on the type of infection (respiratory, urinary tract, abdominal, skin, or central nervous system), with interaction for each analysis being > 0.05.

However, the prolonged and unrestricted use has led to the emergence of mupirocin-resistant (mupR) S. aureus. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence, phenotypic and molecular characteristics, and geographic spread of mupR S. aureus in Africa. Methods: We examined five electronic databases (EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Scopus) for relevant English articles on screening for mupR S. aureus from various samples in Africa. In addition, we performed random effects meta-analysis of proportions to determine the pooled prevalence of mupR S. aureus in Africa. The search was conducted until 3 August 2016. Results: We identified 43 eligible studies of which 11 (26%) were obtained only through Google Scholar. Most of the eligible studies (28/43; 65%) were conducted in Nigeria (10/43; 23%), Egypt (7/43; 16%), South Africa (6/43; 14%) and Tunisia (5/43; 12%). Overall, screening for mupR S. aureus was described in only 12 of 54 (22%) African countries. The disk diffusion method was the widely used technique (67%; 29/43) for the detection of mupR S. aureus in Africa. The mupA-positive S. aureus isolates were identified in five studies conducted in Egypt (n = 2), South Africa (n = 2), and Nigeria (n = 1). Low-level resistance (LmupR) and high-level resistance (HmupR) were both reported in six human studies from South Africa (n = 3), Egypt (n = 2) and Libya (n = 1). Data on mupR-MRSA was available in 11 studies from five countries, including Egypt, Ghana, Libya, Nigeria and South Africa. The pooled prevalence (based on 11 human studies) of mupR S. aureus in Africa was 14% (95% CI =6.8 to 23.2%). The proportion of mupA-positive S. aureus in Africa ranged between 0.5 and 8%. Furthermore, the frequency of S. aureus isolates that exhibited LmupR, HmupR and mupR-MRSA in Africa were 4 and 47%, 0.5 and 38%, 5 and 50%, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of mupR S. aureus in Africa (14%) is worrisome and there is a need for data on administration and use of mupirocin. The disk diffusion method which is widely utilized in Africa could be an important method for the screening and identification of mupR S. aureus. Moreover, we advocate for surveillance studies with appropriate guidelines for screening mupR S. aureus in Africa. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) combined with 2 NRTIs or raltegravir as a second-line regimen. Objective: Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) is known as a key second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings. We carried out a meta-analysis to analyze virologic suppression and effectiveness of LPV/r-based second-line therapy in HIV-infected patients. Methods: In this meta-analysis, we searched randomized controlled trials and observational cohort studies to evaluate outcomes of second-line ART for patients with HIV who failed first-line therapy. A systematic search was conducted in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, and Embase from inception to January 2018. Outcomes included viral suppression, CD4 cell counts, drug resistance, adverse events, and self-reported adherence. We assessed comparative efficacy and safety in a meta-analysis.

The overall successful virologic suppression rate of the second-line regimen was 77% (ITT) and 87% (PP) at 48 weeks with a plasma HIV RNA load of < 400 copies/mL. No statistical significance was found in CD4 cell count recoveries between LPV/r plus 2-3 NRTIs and simplified regimens (LPV/r plus raltegravir) at 48 weeks (P = 0.09), 96 weeks (P = 0.05), and 144 weeks (P = 0.73). Four studies indicated that the virus had low-level resistance to LPV/r, and the most common clinically significant PI-resistance mutations were 46I, 54V, 82A/82F, and 76V; however, no virologic failure due to LPV/r resistance was detected. In addition, no statistical significance was found between the two groups in self-reported adherence [relative risks (RR) = 1.03,95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.07, P = 0.06], grade 3 or 4 adverse events (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.64, 1.10, P = 0.20) or serious events (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.77, 1.17, P = 0.62). Conclusions: These results suggest that the LPV/r-based regimen demonstrates efficacious and low resistance as second-line antiretroviral therapy. Both LPV/r plus 2-3 NRTIs and LPV/r plus RAL regimens improved CD4 cell counts. There was no evidence of superiority of simplified regimens over LPV/r plus 2-3 NRTIs. ? 2018 Huang, Huang, Luo, Zhou, Tao, Chen, Song, Chen and Wu."

Methods: We systematically searched the PubMed? Embase? CINAHL and Psych-Info databases for studies published from January 2010 to October 2017 that reported full hepatitis B vaccination coverage among HCWs in Africa. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine pooled estimates of full vaccination coverage. Results: Of the 331 articles identified, 35 studies from 15 African countries met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The estimated full hepatitis B vaccination coverage was 24.7% (95% CI: 17.3¡V32.0). Regional coverage was highest in northern Africa (62.1%, 95% CI: 42.5¡V81.7) and lowest in central Africa (13.4%, 95% CI: 4.5¡V22.3). Doctors were more likely (OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 1.8¡V3.7) to be fully vaccinated than Nurses with estimated pooled estimates of 52.4% (95% CI: 31.1¡V73.8) and 26.3% (95% CI: 9.7¡V42.9), respectively. Also, HCWs with 10 or more years of experience were more likely to be vaccinated than those with less than 10 years of experience (OR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5¡V3.3). The common reasons identified for non-vaccination of HCWs were unavailability of vaccine 50.5% (95% CI: 26.5¡V74.4), busy work schedule 37.5% (95% CI: 12.6¡V62.4) and cost of vaccination 18.4% (95% CI: 7.1¡V29.7). Conclusion: The evidence available suggests that many HCWs in Africa are at risk of Hepatitis B infection as only a quarter of them were fully vaccinated against Hepatitis B virus. This study highlights the need for all African governments to establish and implement hepatitis B vaccination policies for HCWs. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

However, longer-duration regimens remain the most widely prescribed latent tuberculosis infection treatments. Limitation on adoption of 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine in the U.S. might be because of patients¡¦ preference for self-administered therapy, providers¡¦ lack of familiarity with 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine, or lack of resources to support directly observed therapy. This review examines the most recent evidence regarding 3-month isoniazid-rifapentine's effectiveness, safety, and treatment completion when directly compared with other latent tuberculosis infection regimens primarily comprising 9-month isoniazid treatment. Evidence acquisition: Using Community Guide methodology, reviewers identified, evaluated, and summarized available evidence published during January 2006¡VJune 2017. Analysis of the data was completed in 2017. Evidence synthesis: The analysis included 15 unique studies. Three-month isoniazid-rifapentine was determined to be equal to other latent tuberculosis infection regimens in effectiveness (OR=0.89, 95% CI=0.46, 1.70), and has higher treatment completion (87.5%, 95% CI=83.2%, 91.3%) compared with other latent tuberculosis infection regimens (65.9%, 95% CI=53.5%, 77.3%). Three-month isoniazid-rifapentine was associated with similar risk to other latent tuberculosis infection regimens for adverse events (relative risk=0.59, 95% CI=0.23, 1.52); discontinuing treatment because of adverse events (relative risk=0.48, 95% CI=0.17, 1.34); and death (relative risk=0.79, 95% CI=0.56, 1.11).

Methods: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed using PubMed for articles reporting delayed cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy using a cohort design comparing autologous bone and synthetic implants. Extracted data included implant material and incidence of infection, reoperations related to implant, wound complications, and resorption. Results: One randomized controlled trial and 11 cohort studies were included for a total of 1586 implants (950 bone, 636 synthetic). Autologous implants had significantly more reoperations than did synthetic implants (n = 1586 implants; odds ratio [OR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40¡V2.61).

This systematic review aimed to identify the clinical features, treatment, and outcomes of endograft infection after abdominal endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Methods: A systematic literature review of all published literature from January 1991 to September 2016 on SGI was performed under the instruction of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Aorta, aneurysm, endovascular, stent-graft, endograft and infection were the keywords used in our comprehensive search in PubMed and MEDLINE databases. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, V 22.0. Results: A total of 185 potential relevant articles were identified, but only 11 studies with 402 patients met the inclusion criteria. Majority of the patients were male (308/402, 77%), with a mean age ranging from 65 to 73 years. Most of the endografts were implanted for EVAR (351/402, 87%), while the other 51 (13%) endografts were infected following TEVAR. Among the 402 patients, 39 (9.7%) patients presented with aortic rupture. Ninety-two of 380 (24.2%) patients with available data had aortoenteric fistula (AEF). Sixty-nine patients (17%) died in hospital or within 30 days after operation. One hundred fourteen patients (28%) died during follow-up. The most commonly used stent grafts were Zenith (Cook Inc, Bloomington, IN) (22%) and Excluder (W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, AZ) (20%). Of the 402 patients in this series, 108 patients (27%) had negative culture, and multiple microorganisms were identified in 103 patients (26%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Staphylcoccus species (30.1%), Streptococcus (14.8%), and fungus (9.2%). Forty-two patients (42/401, 10%) received conservative treatment, whereas 359 (90%) patients underwent surgical treatment, including stent graft removal with in situ reconstruction or extra-anatomical bypass, and secondary endovascular procedure. Patients in the surgical group had a higher survival rate compared with conservative group (58% vs. 33%, P = 0.002). The survival rate was higher in the patients with infected EVAR than TEVAR (58% vs. 27%, P = 0.000). Patient with AEF had a worse prognosis (survival rate 72% vs. 33%, P = 0.002). Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that surgical treatment is a better option compared with conservative management in selected patients with aortic endograft infection.

Nevertheless, up-to-date data on the prevalence of HCV infection remain scarce in Iran. This study aimed to review the relevant literature systematically and determine the pooled prevalence of HCV infection among high-risk groups in Iran. Study design: Systematic review & meta-analysis. Methods: In 2016, electronic scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and local databases were searched using a detailed search strategy with language restricted to English and Farsi. The reference lists of the studies included in this review were also screened. Data were reviewed and extracted independently by two authors. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Sources of heterogeneity among the studies were determined using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: In total, 1817 records were identified in the initial search, and 46 records were included in the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of HCV among high-risk groups was 32.3%. The prevalence was 41.3% in injection drug users (IDUs), 22.9% in prisoners, 16.2% in drug-dependent individuals and 24.6% in drug-dependent prisoners. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that geographical location and year of publication were the probable sources of heterogeneity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis found a high prevalence of HCV among high-risk groups in Iran, particularly among IDUs.

Multidrug resistance was also an important problem, with the following global resistance rates: CLA plus MTZ of 10% (adults 20% (95% CI: 15-26) vs children 6% (95% CI: 4-9)) and CLA plus CIP of 2% (primary resistance in children's group). High secondary resistance rates were found for all antibiotics. Resistance was higher among adults for all antibiotics, except CLA that had high resistance levels both among adults and children (42% 95% CI: 14-71 and 40% 95% CI: 33-47). Conclusions: Hp resistance to the most widely used antibiotics is high in Portugal. Accordingly, our results suggest that the best therapeutic strategy for Hp in Portugal may be quadruple therapy with bismuth for adults and triple therapy including AMX plus MTZ or bismuth-based therapy for children. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Consistent TT complication classification must be applied to compare reported literature to standardize TT placement. We aim to determine the overall TT-related complication rates in patients receiving TT for traumatic indications using uniform definitions. METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis was performed assessing TT-related complications. Comprehensive search of several databases (1975-2015) was conducted. We included studies that reported on bedside TT insertion (?22 Fr) in trauma patients. Data were abstracted from eligible articles by independent reviewers with discrepancies reconciled by a third. Analyses were based on complication category subtypes: insertional, positional, removal, infection/immunologic/education, and malfunction. RESULTS Database search resulted in 478 studies; after applying criteria 29 studies were analyzed representing 4,981 TTs. Injury mechanisms included blunt 60% (49-71), stab 27% (17-34), and gunshot 13% (7.8-10). Overall, median complication rate was 19% (95% confidence interval, 14-24.3). Complication subtypes included insertional (15.3%), positional (53.1%), removal (16.2%), infection/immunologic (14.8%), and malfunction (0.6%). Complication rates did not change significantly over time for insertional, immunologic, or removal p = 0.8. Over time, there was a decrease in infectious TT-related complications as well as an increase in positional TT complications. CONCLUSION Generation of evidence-based approaches to improve TT insertion outcomes is difficult because a variety of complication classifications has been used. This meta-analysis of complications after TT insertion in trauma patients suggests that complications have not changed over time remaining stable at 19% over the past three decades.

Methods: A predefined study protocol was developed according to PRISMA. Medline and Scopus were searched for all studies investigating exposure to UTI with UBCNS as the primary outcome. Potential studies were screened against eligibility criteria. Clinical heterogeneity was assessed and groups with more than two studies were evaluated by random effect meta-analysis. Study-level bias was assessed with the Newcastle¡VOttawa Scale (NOS). In cases of substantial between study heterogeneity (I2 &gt; 50%), predefined sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed. Results: Of 16 eligible studies, eight case¡Vcontrol studies spanning four decades and five countries were suitable for quantitative analysis. Main analysis favored exposure to UTI increasing risk of subsequent UBCNS (RR 1.33 [95% CI 1.14¡V1.55]). This effect was no longer statistically significant after excluding studies published prior to year 2000 and at high risk of bias. Between study heterogeneity was considerable for nearly all analyses and not reduced by predefined sensitivity or subgroup analyses. Conclusion: Exposure to UTI favors increased risk for UBCNS, particularly in men, but these effects were statistically insignificant when pooling data from the most recent and highest quality studies. These data do not support findings of previously published studies, that report on heterogenous populations with poor definitions of UTI and minimal control for important confounders. Results from previous studies should be viewed as hypothesis generating. This review highlights the need for higher quality investigation. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

The aim of our meta-analysis was to quantify the risk of BE in the context of HPI. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in 3 databases for studies on BE with data on prevalence of HPI from inception until December 2016. Odds ratios for BE in HPI were calculated by the random effects model with subgroup analyses for geographical location, presence of dysplasia in BE, and length of the BE segment. Results: Seventy-two studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 84?717 BE cases and 390?749 controls. The overall analysis showed that HPI reduces the risk of BE; OR?=?0.68 (95% CI: 0.58-0.79, P?<.001). Subgroup analyses revealed risk reduction in Asia OR?=?0.53 (95% CI: 0.33-0.84, P?=.007), Australia OR?=?0.56 (95% CI: 0.39-0.80, P?=.002), Europe OR?=?0.77 (95% CI: 0.60-0.98, P?=.035), and North-America OR?=?0.59 (95% CI: 0.47-0.74, P?<.001).

Conclusions: This extensive meta-analysis provides additional evidence that HPI is associated with reduced risk of BE. Subgroup analyses confirmed that this risk reduction is independent of geographical location.

Lack of prevalence and risk factor data for rectal chlamydia in women has testing and treatment implications, as azithromycin (a first-line urogenital chlamydia treatment) may be less effective for rectal chlamydia. We conducted a systematic review of studies on women in high-income countries to estimate rectal chlamydia prevalence, concurrency with urogenital chlamydia and associations with reported anal intercourse (AI). Design Systematic review and four meta-analyses conducted using random-effects modelling. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database were searched for articles published between January 1997 and October 2017. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting rectal chlamydia positivity in heterosexual women aged ?15 years old in high-income countries were included. Studies must have used nucleic acid amplification tests and reported both the total number of women tested for rectal chlamydia and the number of rectal chlamydia infections detected. Conference abstracts, case reports and studies with self-reported diagnoses were excluded. Data extracted included setting, rectal and urogenital chlamydia testing results, AI history, and demographics. Results Fourteen eligible studies were identified, all among diverse populations attending sexual health services. Among routine clinic-attending women, summary rectal chlamydia positivity was 6.0% (95% CI 3.2% to 8.9%); summary concurrent rectal chlamydia infection was 68.1% in those who tested positive for urogenital chlamydia (95% CI 56.6% to 79.6%); and of those who tested negative for urogenital chlamydia, 2.2% (95% CI 0% to 5.2%) were positive for rectal chlamydia. Reported AI was not associated with rectal chlamydia (summary risk ratio 0.90; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.10). Conclusions High levels of rectal chlamydia infection have been shown in women with urogenital chlamydia infection. The absence of association between reported AI and rectal chlamydia suggests AI is not an adequate indicator for rectal testing. Further work is needed to determine policy and practice for routine rectal testing in women. ? Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The benefits of routine microbiological screening of neonatal body surface to predict and prevent sepsis are controversial. Aim: To evaluate the prognostic value of neonatal body surface screening for colonization with Gram-negative bacteria for the prediction of late-onset sepsis. Methods: A systematic review was performed, including studies of any design that reported data to calculate prognostic accuracy of surface screening for the prediction of late-onset sepsis. Risk of bias was assessed and a meta-analysis performed. Evidence quality was appraised using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. Findings: Eight studies (all cohort design) were identified as eligible. Studies were performed in six countries in Europe, Asia, and North America and comprised a total of 4829 participants. All studies were at high risk of bias. Pooled sensitivity of body surface screening to predict late-onset sepsis was 41% (95% confidence interval: 17¡V70), whereas pooled specificity was 56% (34¡V76) (hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) model). Subgroup analyses showed higher pooled estimates for specificity but not sensitivity when screening focused on Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. GRADE evidence quality was very low. Conclusion: Limited evidence of very low quality exists regarding the prognostic value of neonatal screening for late-onset sepsis. Carefully planned and conducted prospective studies, including randomized trials, are needed to clarify the potential value of this measure for the prediction and prevention of late-onset sepsis. ? 2018 The Healthcare Infection Society"

The aim of the present review was to compare the perioperative outcomes of acute laparoscopic versus open repair for peptic ulcer disease. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. RESULTS The search included eight RCTs: 615 patients comparing laparoscopic (307 patients) versus open peptic perforated ulcer repair (308 patients). Only few studies reported the Boey score, the Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation score, and the Mannheim Peritonitis Index. In the RCTs, there is a significant heterogeneity about the gastric or duodenal location of peptic ulcer and perforation size. All trials were with high risk of bias. This meta-analysis reported a significant advantage of laparoscopic repair only for postoperative pain in first 24 hours (-2.08; 95% confidence interval, -2.79 to -1.37) and for postoperative wound infection (risk ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.66). An equivalence of the other clinical outcomes (postoperative mortality rate, overall reoperation rate, overall leaks of the suture repair, intra-abdominal abscess rate, operative time of postoperative hospital stay, nasogastric aspiration time, and time to return to oral diet) was reported. CONCLUSION In this meta-analysis, there were no significant differences in most of the clinical outcomes between the two groups; there was less early postoperative pain and fewer wound infections after laparoscopic repair. The reported equivalence of clinical outcomes is an important finding. These results parallel the results of several other comparisons of open versus laparoscopic general surgery operations - equally efficacious with lower rates of wound infection and improvement in some measures of enhanced speed or comfort in recovery. Notably, the trials included have been published throughout a considerable time span during which several changes have occurred in most health care systems, not least a widespread use of laparoscopy and increase in the laparoscopic skills.

This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the ability of vonoprazan to eradicate clarithromycin-susceptible and clarithromycin-resistant H.?pylori strains. Materials and Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Studies were included if they evaluated eradication rates of vonoprazan-based and conventional PPI-based triple therapies and checked for clarithromycin susceptibility of H.?pylori. Results: We identified 5 studies including a total of 1599 patients containing data regarding H.?pylori with clarithromycin susceptibility. Among those infected with clarithromycin-susceptible H.?pylori, eradication rates for vonoprazan-based and conventional PPI-based therapies did not significantly differ in either the randomized (RCT; pooled eradication rates, 95.4% vs 92.8%; pooled odds ratio [OR], 1.63; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.74-3.61; P?=.225) and nonrandomized (NRCT; pooled eradication rates, 92.9% vs 86.2%; OR, 4.58; 95% CI, 0.67-31.45; P?=.122) controlled trials. However, vonoprazan-based triple therapy was significantly superiority to PPI-based therapy for patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains in both RCT (pooled eradication rates, 82.0% vs 40.0%; OR, 6.83; 95% CI, 3.63-12.86; P?<.0001) and NRCT (pooled eradication rates, 80.8% vs 41.8%; OR, 4.98; 95% CI, 2.47-10.03; P?<.0001). Conclusions: Vonoprazan-based and conventional PPI-based therapies are similarly effective for the eradication of clarithromycin-susceptible H.?pylori strains. Vonoprazan is superior to conventional PPI-based therapy for the eradication of clarithromycin-resistant H.?pylori strains. However, clarithromycin was misused because the combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin cures approximately 80% of infections without clarithromycin. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data. Survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model with random effects to adjust for covariates were applied. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO; CRD42012002162). Results: A total of 27 studies (1296 subjects) conducted in eight countries were included. The risk of bias was low for all domains in 17 studies (63.0%). Nine hundred and thirteen subjects were assessed (149 seroreversion events, 83.7% censored data) for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 670 subjects (134 events, 80.0% censored) for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF), and 548 subjects (99 events, 82.0% censored) for indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). A higher probability of seroreversion was observed within a shorter time span in subjects aged 1¡V19 years compared to adults. The chance of seroreversion also varied according to the country where the infection might have been acquired. For instance, the pooled adjusted hazard ratio between children/adolescents and adults for the IIF test was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.64¡V3.71) for certain countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Paraguay) and 9.37 (95% confidence interval 3.44¡V25.50) for Brazil.

Aim: We assessed comparative efficacy and safety of first-line (biologic-na?ve) and second-line (prior exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-£\) agents) biologic therapy for moderate-severe CD, through a systematic review and network meta-analysis, and appraised quality of evidence (QoE) using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Methods: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with moderate-severe CD treated with approved anti-TNF agents, anti-integrin agents and anti-IL12/23 agents, first-line or second-line, and compared with placebo or another active agent. Efficacy outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission; safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. Network meta-analyses were performed, and ranking was assessed using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Results: No head-to-head trials were identified. In biologic-na?ve patients, infliximab (SUCRA,0.93) and adalimumab (SUCRA,0.75) were ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (moderate QoE). In patients with prior anti-TNF exposure, adalimumab (SUCRA, 0.91; low QoE, in patients with prior response or intolerance to anti-TNF agents) and ustekinumab (SUCRA, 0.71) were ranked highest for induction of clinical remission. In patients with response to induction therapy, adalimumab (SUCRA, 0.97) and infliximab (SUCRA, 0.68) were ranked highest for maintenance of remission. Ustekinumab had lowest risk of serious adverse events (SUCRA, 0.72) and infection (SUCRA, 0.71; along with infliximab, SUCRA, 0.83) in maintenance trials.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate which technique in total knee arthroplasty has better clinical effect. Methods: A total of 20 studies involving 2259 cases were included in the meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was Knee Society Score (KSS), whereas the secondary outcomes included other function assessment systems (eg, range of motion, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index), radiological outcomes (eg, femoral component rotation, total outliers), revision rate, complications (eg, infection, loosening, instability), and surgical time. Results: The GB technique was associated with statistically significant increases in the primary outcomes of KSS-function in 1 year. However, a mean difference of 2.12 points was below the minimal clinically important difference of 6 points. No differences were found in the analyses of KSS-knee and KSS-function in any other follow-up periods. Secondary outcome assessments showed significant decreased surgical time (mean difference, 16.18; P <.00001) for MR. Although statistically significant difference in favor of GB was identified in total outliers (risk ratio, 1.72, P =.0004), the 2 techniques were comparable in range of motion, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index, femoral component rotation, complications, and revision rate.

The aim of the present study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on those treatments, with the exception of antibiotic ointments applied to closed skin, which are adequately assessed elsewhere, and a meta-analysis. Methods: Only randomized trials of patients having only colorectal surgery were included in this review. Studies were sought in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials.gov, and the World Health Organization Internet clinical trials register portal. In addition, reference lists of included studies and other published reviews were screened. Meta-analysis was performed for all included studies and subgroup analyses done for each individual intervention. Risk of bias was assessed for each included study, paying particular attention to the preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis used in each study. Sensitivity analyses were done to investigate heterogeneity of the analyses, excluding those studies with a significant risk of bias issues. Absolute risk reduction (RR) was calculated. The overall quality of the evidence for each individual intervention was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and was classified as high, moderate, low or very low. Results: A total of 30 studies are included in this review with 5511 patients, 665 of whom had SSI. The interventions included: 10 studies of gentamicin impregnated sponge or beads wound inlays, 4 studies of chlorhexidine impregnated suture, 11 studies of direct wound lavage or powder application or injection of antibiotics before closure, 4 studies of ionized silver dressing applied to the closed skin, and 1 study of vitamin E oil applied to the open wound. All but one study used preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to topical procedures, although, in some studies, the systemic antibiotic prophylaxis was not the same between groups or varied significantly from the recommended guidelines. Use of gentamycin sponge did not decrease SSI (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75¡V1.16; low-quality evidence) even after including only the studies of abdominal wounds (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.80¡V1.30; low-quality evidence). However, sensitivity analysis excluding studies at high risk of bias decreased the heterogeneity and increased the effect of the prophylaxis for all wounds (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.33¡V0.78; low-quality evidence) and for abdominal wounds only (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20¡V0.72; moderate-quality evidence). Chlorhexidine impregnated suture showed no effect on SSI (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56¡V1.10; low-quality evidence) and an increased efficacy after sensitivity analysis (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22¡V0.79; low-quality evidence). Antibiotic lavage showed a significant decrease in SSI (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26¡V0.79; low-quality evidence) which increased after sensitivity analysis (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15¡V0.72; moderate-quality evidence). Application of silver dressing to the closed wound resulted in a decrease of SSI (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35¡V0.85; moderate-quality evidence). The one study of topical vitamin E oil applied to the open wound showed a significant risk reduction (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05¡V0.98; low-quality evidence). Conclusions: Each of these interventions appears to be effective in decreasing SSI, but the number of studies for each is small and the quality of evidence is very low to moderate. Within the various outcomes of GRADE assessment, even a moderate classification suggests that further studies may well have very different results. No randomized trials exist of combinations of two or more of the above interventions to see if there is a combined effect. Future studies should make sure that the antibiotic used preoperatively is uniform within a study and is consistent with the current guidelines. Deviation from this leads to a significant heterogeneity and risk of bias. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."

However, it is still controversial whether laparoscopic surgery is suitable for patients with stage T4 colon cancer. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare short- and long-term oncological outcomes associated with laparoscopic and conventional open surgery for pT4 colon cancer. Methods: Published studies from 2003 to 2018 comparing oncological outcomes following laparoscopic and open surgery for pT4 colon cancer were systematically searched. Data on conversion rate, R0 resection rate, number of harvested lymph nodes, morbidity and mortality, and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were subjected to meta-analysis using fixed-effect and random-effect models. Results: Twelve observational studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 2396 cases (1250 laparoscopic and 1146 open). There was no significant difference in R0 resection rate [relative risk (RR) = 1.007; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.935¡V1.085; P = 0.850], number of harvested lymph nodes (MD = 0.004; 95% CI = ?0.139 to 0.148; P = 0.951), mortality (RR = 0.509; 95% CI = 0.176¡V1.470; P = 0.212), and 3-year OS (RR = 1.056; 95% CI = 0.939¡V1.188; P = 0.360), 5-year OS (RR = 1.003; 95% CI = 0.883¡V1.139; P = 0.966), 3-year DFS (RR = 1.032; 95% CI = 0.903¡V1.179; P = 0.642), and 5-year DFS (RR = 0.995; 95% CI = 0.868¡V1.140; P = 0.973) between the groups. The rate of conversion from laparoscopic to open procedures was 10.7% (95% CI = 0.090¡V0.124). There was a significant difference in incidence of complications within 30 postoperative days between laparoscopic and open surgery (RR = 0.703; 95% CI = 0.564¡V0.876; P = 0.002). Conclusion: Laparoscopic surgery is safe and feasible in pT4 colon cancer, oncological outcomes are similar, and more importantly, there are fewer postoperative complications compared with open surgery. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

OSA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The prevalence is estimated to range from 3% to 7% in the general population but may be much higher. Several studies show that weight loss or bariatric surgery may have a role in treating OSA. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the safety and efficacy of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of weight loss surgery for adults with OSA and comorbid obesity. Methods and analysis A search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE and two major Chinese biomedical databases will be performed to identify related trials published as of October 2018. This study will include RCTs, comparing different types of weight loss surgery for OSA with obesity or weight loss surgery for OSA with obesity with other upper airway surgeries. The primary outcomes that will be measured are apnoea-hypopnoea index, excess weight loss and in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes will include duration of hospital stay, neck circumference, reoperation, waist circumference, body mass index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, overt complications (eg, gastric fistula, bleeding, delayed gastric emptying, wound infection), quality of life, quality of sleep and/or functionality. The systematic review will be conducted according to the recommendations as outlined by the Cochrane collaboration. Ethics and dissemination The systematic review and meta-analysis will include published data available online and thus ethics approval will not be required. The findings will be disseminated and published in a peer-reviewed journal. Review updates will be conducted if there is new evidence that may cause any change in review conclusions. Any changes to the study protocol will be updated in the PROSPERO trial registry accordingly. PROSPERO registration number CRD42017081743. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

It increases the risk of surgical complications and re-operations. While both MIS-TLIF and O-TLIF are reported to have comparably good long-term outcomes for non-obese patients, no consensus has been reached for obese patients. Methods: A comprehensive search of the published literature was performed: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database in accordance to the PRISMA 2009 checklist. Data were collected with attention to baseline demographics, intra-operative blood loss, duration of surgery, surgical complications, hospitalization stay, VAS and Oswestry disability index (ODI) pre- and postoperatively. Results: A total of 863 abstracts were identified from the databases, of which 4 articles were included in the meta-analysis. A total of 430 patients were identified, of which 217(50.5%) underwent the O-TLIF, while 213(49.5%) underwent MIS-TLIF. One hundred and ninety-four (45.1%) patients were males, while 236(54.9%) were females. The average age was 54.8 ¡Ó 12.0?years. The pooled BMI was 33.4 ¡Ó 4.7 for the open-TLIF group, and 32.7 ¡Ó 3.9 for MIS-TLIF group (p = 0.22). When comparing O-TLIF to MIS-TLIF: Patients who underwent O-TLIF had 383 mls more blood loss (95% CI: 329.5¡V437.4, p < 0.00001), 1.2-day longer hospitalization stay (95% CI: 0.80¡V1.62, p < 0.00001) and 3.8 times higher risk of dural tear (95% CI: 1.61¡V9.87, p = 0.003) when compared to MIS-TLIF patients. A trend toward higher postoperative wound infection rates (O-TLIF: 4.5%, MIS-TLIF: 2.4%) and an inferior improvement in ODI score (O-TLIF: 39.3, MIS-TLIF: 44.1) was found in O-TLIF patients when compared to MIS-TLIF patients. However, these were not statistically significant. Conclusion: MIS-TLIF is safe and may be a better option for lumbar fusion in obese patients.

A number of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggest the use of pharmaconutrition in this group of patients produces superior outcomes to standard nutritional formulations in terms of postoperative infective complications, anastomotic breakdown and length of hospital stay. The use of pharmaconutrition products, therefore, has gained increasing acceptance for use in elective gastrointestinal oncological surgical populations and been incorporated into practice guidelines. However, there remains doubts as to the robustness of such data supporting these recommendation. This is because studies reporting improved outcomes with pharmaconutrition (I) frequently compare this intervention with non-equivalent control groups; (II) do not report on the actual nutritional provision received by study participants; (III) overlook the potential impact of industry funding on research conducted and (IV) do not adopt a multidisciplinary approach to the research undertaken. For these reasons, a critical re-appraisal of the use and recommendations of pharmaconutrition in this group of patients is urgently warranted to resolve some of the above mentioned issues. The aim of this review was to analyse meta-analyses published until the end of 2016 in this area to highlight the strengths and weakness of the present research and prioritize certain areas which will benefit from future research. ?

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Comprehensive searches of Medline, Embase and Web of Science were carried out to identify comparative studies of the association between alcohol intake and CAP between 1985 and 2017. Reference lists were also screened. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled effect sizes. A dose-response meta-analysis was also performed. Results We found 17 papers eligible for inclusion in the review, of which 14 provided results which could be pooled. Meta-analysis of these 14 studies identified an 83% increased risk of CAP among people who consumed alcohol or in higher amounts, relative to those who consumed no or lower amounts of alcohol, respectively (relative risk=1.83, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.57). There was substantial between-study heterogeneity, which was attributable in part to differences in study continent, adjustment for confounders and pneumonia diagnosis (clinical vs death). Dose-response analysis found that for every 10-20 g higher alcohol intake per day, there was an 8% increase in the risk of CAP. Conclusions The findings suggest that alcohol consumption increases the risk of CAP. Therefore, strengthening policies to reduce alcohol intake would be likely to reduce the incidence of CAP. ?

After avulsion and replantation, teeth are at risk of infection and root resorption, which may affect treatment outcome and survival rate. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the incidence of root resorption after the replantation of avulsed teeth. Methods: Two reviewers searched 7 electronic databases for observational studies involving human subjects that evaluated the incidence of root resorption after tooth avulsion. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument, and the quality of available evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Results: Of the 1507 articles, 23 met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was conducted and showed that the incidence of internal root resorption was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02¡V5.50). Regarding external root resorption, the incidence of surface root resorption was 13.3% (95% CI, 6.21¡V22.62), that of inflammatory root resorption was 23.2% (95% CI, 13.94¡V34.19), and that of replacement root resorption was 51.0% (95% CI, 40.10¡V62.00). Two studies presented a high RoB, 16 had a moderate RoB, and 11 had a low RoB. The overall level of evidence identified was very low.

Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched. Randomized trials and comparative observational studies with multivariate analysis and/or matching were included. Guidelines from National Guideline Clearinghouse and Guidelines International Network were assessed using the AGREE II instrument. Results: The search revealed 3530 records; 328 were selected for full-text review; 48 were included: 8 systematic reviews, 2 randomized studies, 26 comparative observational studies, 2 guideline-articles and 10 case series; in addition 13 guidelines were evaluated. Literature to assess the effectiveness of ablation was limited. RFA + systemic chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone. PH was superior to RFA alone but not to RFA + PH or to MWA. Compared to PH, RFA showed fewer complications, MWA did not. Outcomes were subject to residual confounding since ablation was only employed for unresectable disease. Conclusion: The results from the EORTC-CLOCC trial, the comparable survival for ablation + PH versus PH alone, the potential to induce long-term disease control and the low complication rate argue in favour of ablation over chemotherapy alone. Further randomized comparisons of ablation to current-day chemotherapy alone should therefore be considered unethical. Hence, the highest achievable level of evidence for unresectable CRLM seems reached. The apparent selection bias from previous studies and the superior safety profile mandate the setup of randomized controlled trials comparing ablation to surgery. ? 2018, The Author(s)."

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether WeChat helped improve PICC-related complications, self-care ability, PICC maintenance dependency in that the behavior of a patient is in compliance with a doctor¡¦s order or a will, knowledge mastery, and satisfaction among patients with a PICC. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China Biology Medicine, China national Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, Wiper, and Baidu Scholar databases were searched to identify related reports that were published up to April 2018. This search revealed 36 reports that were published during 2014¡V2018, including 2,623 controls and 2,662 patients who used the WeChat application. Relative to the traditional follow-up group, the group that received WeChat follow-up had a lower risk of PICC-related complications (odds ratio [OR]: 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.19¡V0.27, P < 0.00001), better self-care ability (mean difference: 36.41, 95% CI: 34.68¡V38.14, P < 0.00001), higher PICC maintenance dependency (OR: 4.27, 95% CI: 3.35¡V5.44, P < 0.00001), and higher patient satisfaction (OR: 6.20, 95% CI: 4.32¡V8.90, P < 0.00001). Eight studies reported knowledge mastery, although the different evaluation tools precluded a meta-analysis. Nevertheless, those eight studies revealed that knowledge mastery was significantly higher in the WeChat group than in the traditional follow-up group (P < 0.05). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of WeChat follow-up on self-management among patients who are discharged with a PICC. It appears that WeChat follow-up can help improve the incidence of complications, self-care ability, PICC maintenance dependence, and patient satisfaction. However, the WeChat application itself cannot improve patients¡¦ self-management ability. Further studies are needed to produce high-quality evidence to determine whether WeChat is an effective follow-up tool. ? 2018 Ma et al.

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched electronically. Only cases with a prenatal diagnosis of apparently isolated severe ventriculomegaly and postnatal neurodevelopmental assessment were selected and included. Severe ventriculomegaly was defined as enlargement of the ventricular atria, with a diameter of greater than 15 mm in the transventricular plane. All cases in which the investigators were unable to detect associated structural abnormality, chromosomal abnormality or fetal infection, and in which the ventriculomegaly was therefore regarded as apparently isolated, were included. Those for which the etiology was identified prenatally were excluded, whereas those with postnatal identification of the underlying cause were not excluded, since this information was not available prenatally. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle¡VOttawa Scale (NOS) for cohort studies. Pregnancy outcomes such as termination, stillbirth, neonatal survival and developmental outcome of the baby, were recorded. The degree of disability was classified as no, mild or severe disability. Statistical assessment was performed by meta-analysis of proportions to combine data, weighting the studies using the inverse variance method and a random-effects model. Proportions and CIs were reported. Results: Eleven studies including 137 fetuses were found. Twenty-seven pregnancies underwent termination and were excluded. The remaining 110 fetuses with apparently isolated severe ventriculomegaly for which continuation of pregnancy was intended, form the study population. Overall quality assessed using NOS for cohort studies was good. Survival was reported in 95/110 (pooled proportion 87.9% (95% CI, 75.6¡V96.2%)) cases. In 15/110 (pooled proportion 12.1% (95% CI, 3.8¡V24.4%)), either stillbirth or neonatal demise was reported. No disability was reported in 41/95 survivors (pooled proportion 42.2% (95% CI, 27.5¡V57.6%)). However, 17/95 showed mild/moderate disability (pooled proportion 18.6% (95% CI, 7.2¡V33.8%)) and 37/95 were reported to have severe disability (pooled proportion 39.6% (95% CI, 30.0¡V50.0%)). Conclusions: Four-fifths of fetuses with severe ventriculomegaly survive and, of these, just over two-fifths show normal neurodevelopment. The overall survivors without disability account for more than one third of the total. Given that many cases undergo termination of pregnancy and require longer follow-up in order to detect subtle abnormalities, mortality and prevalence of developmental delay may be even higher than that reported in this paper.

The association between sCD23 and NHL was indicated as odds ratio (OR) along with its related 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Meta-analysis was conducted via RevMan 5.3. A total of five studies, which included 964 B-NHL patients and 1243 matched controls without B-NHL, among which 257 were HIV-positive donors and 986 were general controls, were included in our study. Meta-analysis revealed a significant association between peripheral sCD23 level and B-NHL in HIV-positive samples (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25, 2.20; P = 0.0005) as well as the general population (OR 2.51; 95% CI 1.71, 3.86; P < 0.00001). Meta-analysis, stratified by sampling time prior to diagnosis, indicated potential HIV-NHL patients are 2.34-folds more likely to have higher blood sCD23 level, although this association is statistically meaningful only during 3¡V5?years prior to diagnosis (95% CI 1.27, 4.33). Subgroup analysis based on B-NHL type demonstrated a significant association between sCD23 level and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). The findings of our study indicate a positive association of circulating sCD23 level and B-NHL risks and highlight the possibility of sCD23 as a predictive marker of B-NHL.

However, conflicting survival benefits of pure dose-dense chemotherapy have been reported in different randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This meta-analysis aimed to further assess the efficacy and safety of pure dose-dense chemotherapy in breast cancer. Methods: A literature search of electronic databases and websites was performed to identify phase III RCTs reporting the efficacy and toxicity of pure dose-dense chemotherapy. The endpoints of interest were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicities. The hazard ratios (HRs) of death and recurrence and the odds ratios (ORs) of adverse events were estimated and pooled. Results: Seven studies (five trials) were eligible, encompassing a total of 9851 patients. Patients treated with dose-dense chemotherapy obtained better DFS (HR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.75-0.91; p = 0.0001) than those treated with the conventional schedule, while OS benefit of dose-dense chemotherapy was less impressive (HR = 0.86; 95% CI 0.73-1.02; p = 0.08). However, significant OS benefit was observed in node-positive patients (HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.90; p = 0.001). The incidence of anemia, pain, and transaminase elevation was higher in the dose-dense chemotherapy arm. Conclusions: Dose-dense chemotherapy leads to better prognosis; these findings suggest that it may be a potentially preferred treatment for breast cancer patients, particularly for women with lymph node involvement. However, more RCTs are warranted to better define the best candidates for dose-dense chemotherapy. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

In Nigeria for instance, despite several community-based and provincial reports, national data on prevalence, burdens and risk zones (RZs) for STH infections are lacking. Methods: The present study employed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to determine the prevalence, distribution and RZs for STH infections among Nigerian children through a meta-analysis of data published between 1980 and 2015. Pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) was determined by the random-effects model while heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q-test. Results: A total of 18 901 of the 34 518 Nigerian children aged 0-17 years examined across 19 Nigerian states during the period under review were infected with one or more species of STHs. The overall PPE for STH infections was 54.8% (95% CI: 54.2-55.3). PPEs for sub-groups ranged between 13.2% (95% CI: 11.5-15.1) and 80.9% (95% CI: 80.0-81.7). Highest PPEs for STH infections were observed among children within community settings (59.0%, 95% CI: 57.7-60.4) and school-aged children (54.9%, 95% CI: 54.3-55.5). Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent species (44.6%, 95% CI: 44.0-45.2). Over 36% (15/41) of the studies were published from south-western Nigeria. South-western region was the only high risk zone (HRZ) for STH infections while the rest of the regions were low risk zones (LRZs). Conclusions: STH infections involving Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms are highly prevalent across Nigeria. Strategic use of anthelmintics, health education and adequate sanitation, taking into account this epidemiologic information will help in the control of these infections in Nigeria. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Results: In total, five studies (0 RCT, five CCTs) were included in the systematic review and three studies were included in the meta-analysis. The risk difference for immediate implant placement in an infected extraction socket compared with that in a non-infected socket was ?0.02. WMDs for MBL, PD, mBI, MGL and WKG between the two groups were 0.32, 0.12, 0.07, ?0.06, 0.20 and 0.51, respectively. No statistical differences were observed between the two groups, except for the change in WKG. Conclusions: Implants can be placed in infected extraction sockets after thorough socket debridement. For aesthetics, WKG should be considered when performing immediate implant placement in infected sites. ? 2018 Acta Odontologica Scandinavica Society."

It has excellent bioavailability and broad antifungal spectrum; thus, it is an attractive option for patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). Comparing efficacy and safety of voriconazole with other antifungals in prophylaxis or treatment of IFIs would be useful to draw conclusions regarding prevention and therapeutics of these infections. Aim: To assess efficacy and safety of voriconazole compared with other options as prophylaxis or treatment of IFIs in haematology-oncology patients. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE database using the search term ¡¥voriconazole¡¦ and completed with manual search. Study selection: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing voriconazole with other antifungal agents or placebo. Data extraction: Seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Results: Five studies compared voriconazole to another comparator as prophylaxis of IFIs and two as treatment. Pooled results showed that voriconazole was more effective than the comparator (RR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.01¡V1.34), but heterogeneity was significant (Q test 32.7; p =.00001). Sub-analysis according to prophylaxis showed RR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.00¡V1.37; while as treatment, RR = 1.23; 95%CI = 0.68¡V2.22. Risk of adverse events was not different from that observed for the comparator (RR = 1.06, 95%CI = 0.66¡V1.72) though significant heterogeneity was detected (p <.01). Conclusions: Voriconazole was as effective and safe as comparators, probably better as prophylaxis than as treatment, but limitations due to variability in the sample size of studies, differences in the age of patients, and heterogeneity between studies¡¦ outcome measures indicate the need for further research. ? 2017, ? 2017 Society for Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases."

However, the role of H.pylori infection in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is still debatable. This meta-analysis is aimed at exploring the association between SSc and H.pylori infection.METHODS: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed from inception through February 2018. The inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating H.pylori infection in SSc. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of H.pylori infection and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis to compare risk between SSc patients and healthy controls. The between-study heterogeneity of effect-size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2.RESULTS: Data were extracted from 8 observational studies involving 1,446 subjects. The pooled results demonstrated an increased H.pylori infection in SSc compared with healthy controls (OR=2.10; 95% CI: 1.57-2.82, p value<0.01, I2=13%). Subgroup analysis showed an increased risk of H.pylori infection measured with H.pylori ELISA test (OR=2.49; 95% CI: 1.82-3.40, p value<0.01, I2=0%).CONCLUSIONS: Our study has shown that patients with SSc have an increased prior existence of H.pylori infection. This finding implies that the role of previous infection may cause an abnormal immunological cascade in the pathogenesis of SSc. Further studies that could elucidate the inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of SSc are warranted."

As the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) caused by oral HPV infections is rising, further investigation into the natural history of such infections is needed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesize data on the prevalence, incidence, clearance, and persistence of oral HPV infections in healthy individuals. A systematic review of literature published between January 1995 and August 2017 was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Meta-analysis of prevalence and incidence data was conducted. Clearance and persistence data were extracted. Sixty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated an overall prevalence of 7.7% for all types of HPV and 1.4% for high-risk HPV16. The overall incidence was 4.38 cases per 1000 person-months for all HPV types and 0.92 cases per 1000 person-months for HPV16. This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that oral HPV infection has a lower prevalence and incidence than cervicogenital HPV infection in healthy individuals.

Herein, we present a meta-analysis exploring the association between MDRPA and S?o Paulo MBL-1 (SPM-1)-producing strains vs. mortality. Online databases were screened to identify studies published between 2006 and 2016. A total of 15 studies, comprising 3,201 cases of P. aeruginosa infection, were included. Our results demonstrated a higher mortality rate among patients infected with MDRPA (44.6%, 363/813) than those with non-MDRPA infection (24.8%, 593/2,388) [odds ratio (OR) 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70-3.36, p <0.00001]. The risk of mortality in patients with non-SPM-1 strains was four times higher than that observed in the patients of the SPM-1 group; however, no statistically significant difference was observed (p = 0.43). In conclusion, the results of our study demonstrated that patients infected with MDRPA had a significantly higher mortality rate than that of patients infected with non-MDRPA strains, especially patients with bloodstream infection (BSI), immunosuppression, and inadequate antimicrobial therapy. The absence of studies on the molecular aspects of blaSPM-1 and its association with mortality limited the analysis; therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution. Our findings also highlight the need for more studies on the molecular aspects of resistance and the peculiarities of different nosocomial settings. ? 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

Caesarean section is a high volume procedure and the estimated incidence of SSI may be as high as 9%. Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify a suite of perioperative strategies and surgical techniques that reduce the risk of SSI following caesarean section. Search strategy: Six electronic databases were searched to systematically review literature reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses published from 2006 to 2016. Search terms included: endometritis, SSI, caesarean section, meta-analysis, review, systematic. Selection criteria: Studies were sought in which competing perioperative strategies and surgical techniques relevant for caesarean section were identified and quantifiable infection outcomes were reported. General infection control strategies were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Data on study characteristics and clinical effectiveness were extracted. Quality, including bias within individual studies, was examined using a modified A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist.

The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between perioperative glycemic control and the risk for SSI, mainly periprosthetic joint infection. Methods: We searched OVID-MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception up to June 2017. The main independent variable was glycemic control as defined by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) or perioperative glucose values. The main outcome was SSI. Publication year, location, study design, sample population (size, age, gender), procedure, glycemic control assessment, infection outcome, results, confounders, and limitations were assessed. Studies included in the meta-analysis had stratified glycemic control using a distinct HbA1C cut-off. Results: Seventeen studies were included in this study. Meta-analysis of 10 studies suggested that elevated HbA1C levels were associated with a higher risk of SSI after TJA (pooled odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 0.94-2.37, P =.09) with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 81.32%, P &lt;.0001). In a subgroup analysis of studies considering HbA1C with a cut-off of 7% as uncontrolled, this association was no longer noticed (P =.50). All 5 studies that specifically assessed for SSI and perioperative hyperglycemia showed a significant association, which was usually attenuated after adjusting for covariates. Conclusion: Inadequate glycemic control was associated with increased risk for SSI after TJA. However, the optimal HbA1C threshold remains contentious. Pooled data does not support the conventional 7% cut-off for risk stratification. Future studies should examine new markers for determining adequate glycemic control. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of prophylaxis on developing a multidrug-resistant first recurrent UTI among children with vesicoureteral reflux. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register through May 25, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of patients ?18 years of age with a history of vesicoureteral reflux being treated with continuous antibiotic prophylaxis compared with no treatment or placebo with available antibiotic sensitivity profiles. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent observers abstracted data and assessed quality and validity per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Adjusted meta-analyses were performed by using a mixed-effects logistic regression model. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and ninety-nine patients contributed 224 UTIs. Patients treated with prophylaxis were more likely to have a multidrug-resistant infection (33% vs 6%, P <. 001) and were more likely to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (68% vs 49%, P =. 004). Those receiving prophylaxis had 6.4 times the odds (95% confidence interval: 2.7-15.6) of developing a multidrug-resistant infection. One multidrug-resistant infection would develop for every 21 reflux patients treated with prophylaxis. LIMITATIONS: Variables that may contribute to resistance such as medication adherence and antibiotic exposure for other illnesses could not be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis increases the risk of multidrug resistance among recurrent infections. This has important implications in the risk-benefit assessment of prophylaxis as a management strategy and in the selection of empirical treatment of breakthrough infections in prophylaxis patients.

Method: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2017 were screened in 6 databases and assessed for relevance against criteria. Data was extracted for factors associated with travel-related STI or proxies. Meta-analyses estimated pooled prevalence of casual sex and non-condom use. Adjusted odds ratios of predictors were pooled to generate a combined estimate. Result: Forty-nine articles qualified for inclusion. A heterogeneity test indicated variation across studies. The pooled prevalence of casual travel sex was 35% and prevalence of non-condom use 17%. Expectations of casual sex strongly predicted sex with a new partner when travelling abroad.

Preexisting chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and asthma were thought to predict risk of progression to severe infections. Objective We aimed to quantify the frequency of chronic comorbidities in flavivirus diseases to provide an estimate for their prevalence in severe and non-severe infections and examine whether chronic diseases contribute to the increased risk of severe viral expression. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic and grey literature databases to identify studies reporting prevalence estimates of comorbidities in flavivirus diseases. Study quality was assessed with the risk of bias tool. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for severe infection in the presence of chronic comorbidities. Results We identified 65 studies as eligible for inclusion for DENV (47 studies) and WNV (18 studies). Obesity and overweight (i.e., BMI&gt; 25 kg/m2, prevalence: 24.5%, 95% CI: 18.6¡V31.6%), hypertension (17.1%, 13.3¡V21.8%) and diabetes (13.3%, 9.3¡V18.8%) were the most prevalent comorbidities in DENV. However, hypertension (45.0%, 39.1¡V51.0%), diabetes (24.7%, 20.2¡V29.8%) and heart diseases (25.6%, 19.5¡V32.7%) were the most prevalent in WNV. ORs of severe flavivirus diseases were about 2 to 4 in infected patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases. The small number of studies in JEV, YFV and Zika did not permit estimating the prevalence of comorbidities in these infections. Conclusion Higher prevalence of chronic comorbidities was found in severe cases of flavivirus diseases compared to non-severe cases. Findings of the present study may guide public health practitioners and clinicians to evaluate infection severity based on the presence of comorbidity, a critical public health measure that may avert severe disease outcome given the current dearth of clear prevention practices for some flavivirus diseases. ? 2018 Badawi et al.

There was heterogeneity in most outcomes considered, and publication bias in many studies. The standard of trial reporting was low. The patient population size, and the number of studies included, were small. Conclusions: HA?¡Ó?CS appears to reduce the rate of UTI and increase the time to recurrence in women with RUTI. As randomized controlled studies are available only for HA plus CS, the quality of evidence is higher for the combination than for HA alone. ? 2017, The Author(s)."

The aim of this study was to assess the benefits and risks of TGC compared with conventional glycemic control (CGC) in critically ill pediatric patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) by using data retrieved from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Method: EMBASE, CNKI, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database were searched for RCTs comparing TGC with CGC in critically ill children in PICU. Result: The meta-analysis included five RCTs representing 3933 patients and compared TGC with CGC. Our result revealed that TGC did not reduce the 30-day mortality rates (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.74¡V1.32, P = 0.95) and was not associated with decreasing health care-associated infections (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64¡V1.00, P = 0.05) compared with CGC, but significantly increased the incidence of hypoglycemia (OR 6.37, 95% CI 4.41¡V9.21, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Tight glycemic control was not associated with reducing the 30-day mortality rates and acquired infections compared with CGC in critically ill children. Significant increase of the incidence of hypoglycemia was revealed in TGC group. The conclusion should be interpreted with caution for the methodological heterogeneity among trials. ? 2018, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted relative to empiric prophylaxis regimens on rates of infectious complications after TRUSPB and to determine the baseline prevalence of FQ resistance based on prior rectal swabs. Methods: An electronic search within literature databases including EMBASE and Web of Science (all databases) for articles assessing TAP as an approach to TRUSPB prophylaxis was conducted. Quality assessment was performed using the Hoy instrument. Meta-analysis was performed using MetaXL 5.3. Results: From 15 studies (eight retrospective and seven prospective) representing 12,320 participants, infectious complication incidence was 3.4% in EAP and 0.8% in TAP patients. The number needed to treat with TAP to avoid one more infection when compared to the EAP group was 39. Effect sizes were homogeneous. Prevalence of FQ resistance showed low (15%) and high (28%) subgroups, likely due to region of origin (within and outside USA, respectively). Conclusions: Rectal culture prior to TRUSPB and use of TAP adjusts for endemic FQ resistance and is associated with less infectious complications and resulting morbidity when compared to EAP. Overtreatment associated with augmented prophylaxis approaches may be reduced as a result. Further prospective assessment and cost¡Vbenefit analyses are required before widespread implementation can be recommended. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

Recent evidence suggests that rigid plate fixation for sternal closure may reduce the risk of sternal complications. Methods: The Medline and Embase databases were searched from inception to February 2017 for studies that compared rigid plate fixation with wire cerclage for cardiac surgery patients undergoing sternotomy. Random effects meta-analysis compared rates of sternal complications (primary outcome, defined as deep or superficial sternal wound infection, or sternal instability), early mortality, and length of stay (secondary outcomes). Results: Three randomized controlled trials (n = 427) and five unadjusted observational studies (n = 1,025) met inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in sternal complications with rigid plate fixation at a median of 6 months¡¦ follow-up (incidence rate ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20 to 1.29, p = 0.15) overall, but a decrease when including only patients at high risk for sternal complications (incidence rate ratio 0.23, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.89, p = 0.03; two observational studies). Perioperative mortality was reduced favoring rigid plate fixation (relative risk 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.97, p = 0.04; four observational studies and one randomized controlled trial). Length of stay was similar overall (mean difference ?0.77 days, 95% CI: ?1.65 to +0.12, p = 0.09), but significantly reduced with rigid plate fixation in the observational studies (mean difference ?1.34 days, 95% CI: ?2.05 to ?0.63, p = 0.0002). Conclusions: This meta-analysis, driven by the results of unmatched observational studies, suggests that rigid plate fixation may lead to reduced sternal complications in patients at high risk for such events, improved perioperative survival, and decreased hospital length of stay. More randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the potential benefits of rigid plate fixation for primary sternotomy closure. ? 2018 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons"

Methods We searched online databases for articles reporting comparisons between population cohorts aged ? 15 years who were exposed or unexposed to infant HBV immunization programmes. We categorized programmes as universal or targeted to infants whose mothers were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). We included studies reporting prevalence of hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), HBsAg, or both. We evaluated the quality of the study methods and estimated the relative reduction in the prevalence of infection. Findings Of 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria, most were from China (20 studies). The prevalence of HBV infection in unvaccinated and universally vaccinated cohorts ranged from 0.6% (116 of 20 305 people) to 16.3% (60/367) and from 0.3% (1/300) to 8.5% (73/857), respectively. Comparing cohorts with universal vaccination to those without vaccination, relative prevalences were 0.24 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.16¡V0.35) for HBsAg and 0.23 (95% CI: 0.17¡V0.32) for HBcAb. For populations with targeted vaccination, relative prevalences were 0.32 (95% CI: 0.24¡V0.43) and 0.33 (95% CI: 0.23¡V0.45), respectively. Conclusion The residual burden of infection in cohorts offered vaccination suggests that longer-term evaluations of vaccination coverage, timeliness and other aspects of programme quality are needed. As HBV-vaccinated infant cohorts reach adulthood, ongoing analysis of prevalence in adolescents and young adults will ensure that elimination efforts are on track. ? 2018, World Health Organization.

However, emergency and thereby sometimes night-time surgery is associated with several drawbacks, whereas the consequences of surgery after limited delay are unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess in-hospital delay before surgery as risk factor for complicated appendicitis and postoperative morbidity in patients with acute appendicitis. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 1990 to 2016 for studies including patients who underwent appendicectomy for acute appendicitis, reported in two or more predefined time intervals. The primary outcome measure was complicated appendicitis after surgery (perforated or gangrenous appendicitis); other outcomes were postoperative surgical-site infection and morbidity. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were pooled using forest plots if possible. Unadjusted data were pooled using generalized linear mixed models. Results: Forty-five studies with 152 314 patients were included. Pooled adjusted ORs revealed no significantly higher risk for complicated appendicitis when appendicectomy was delayed for 7¡V12 or 13¡V24 h (OR 1¡P07, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P98 to 1¡P17, and OR 1¡P09, 0¡P95 to 1¡P24, respectively). Meta-analysis of unadjusted data supported these findings by yielding no increased risk for complicated appendicitis or postoperative complications with a delay of 24¡V48 h. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrates that delaying appendicectomy for presumed uncomplicated appendicitis for up to 24 h after admission does not appear to be a risk factor for complicated appendicitis, postoperative surgical-site infection or morbidity. Delaying appendicectomy for up to 24 h may be an acceptable alternative for patients with no preoperative signs of complicated appendicitis. ? 2018 The Authors.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of closed suction drains after primary total knee arthroplasty were eligible for this study. Useful data were extracted to calculate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as summary estimates.RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs were included in the quantitative analysis. Compared with patients in the nondrainage group, those in the drainage group were significantly correlated with a decreased need of dressing change (RR?=?0.31, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.79, P?=?.015) but an increased risk of homologous transfusion (RR?=?1.38, 95% CI: 1.04-1.83) and longer time to regain straight-leg raising (WMD?=?0.97 d, 95% CI: 0.48-1.46). Two groups showed no significant difference in total blood loss, hemoglobin drop, superficial wound infection, prosthetic joint infection, formation of deep vein thrombosis, duration of hospital stay, and range of movement.CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, the use of closed suction drains after total knee arthroplasty is probably not superior to no drains for most outcome measures and therefore surgeons may wish to reconsider the routine use of this empirical practice until there is further evidence."

Summary of Background Data: The natural history of CM can be a progressive disease process. In such cases, where surgical decompression is indicated to halt the progression, ACCF is typically chosen for pathology located posterior to the vertebral body. Numerous studies have shown that decompression with appropriate stabilization not only halts progression, but also improves patient outcomes. However, several constructs are available for this procedure, all with variable outcomes. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted using Cochrane Database, Medline, and PubMed. Only studies with a minimum patient population of 10, reporting on CM because of cervical spondylosis or ossified posterior longitudinal ligament were included; a minimum follow-up period of 12 months and 1 clinical and/or radiographic outcome were required. Studies examining patients with cervical trauma/fracture, tumor, and infection or revision cases were excluded. Data analysis was carried out with Microsoft Excel. Results: A total of 30 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, while 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. Constructs that were reported in these studies included titanium mesh cages, nano-hydroxyapatite/polyamide 66 composite struts, bone graft alone, expandable corpectomy cages, and polyetheretherketone cages. Clinical outcomes included Japanese Orthopaedic Association and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scores, Visual Analog Scale scores, Neck Disability Index scores, and Nurick grades. Radiographic outcomes included C2-C7 and segmental Cobb angles and pseudarthrosis rates. Each construct type had variable and unique benefits and shortcomings. Conclusions: ACCF is a common surgical option for CM, despite carrying certain risks expected of any anterior cervical approach. Several constructs are available for ACCF, all with variable clinical and radiographic outcomes. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

We compared the efficacy of a one-stage vs two-stage approach to brachiobasilic AVF creation by primarily investigating primary and secondary patency rates. We hypothesize that the two-stage is superior to the one-stage procedure in terms of efficacy and safety. Methods: This review was performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Database. Risk of bias and quality assessment scores were both performed based on previously validated tool. Results: The systematic search revealed a total of 242 publications for possible inclusion. On the basis of title and abstract review, two randomized controlled trials and nine case-cohort series fit our inclusion criteria. There were no statistically significant differences in failure rates (pooled risk ratio [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.55; P =.25), 1-year primary patency rates (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.83-2.06; P =.24), 1-year secondary patency rates (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.54-1.77) and 2-year secondary patency rates (RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.54-2.63; P =.67) between both groups. However, the two-stage procedure had significantly improved 2-year primary patency rates (RR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.66-3.74; P <.00001). There were no differences in steal syndrome, hematoma, infection, pseudoaneuryms, or stenosis, although there was a trend toward an increased incidence of postoperative thrombosis (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.95-3.45; P =.07) in one-stage procedures. Conclusions: With improved 2-year primary patency rates and the absence of significant differences in complications, this study suggests potential benefit of a two-stage over a one-stage procedure for brachiobasilic AVF creation. However, rather than being a definitive answer, our results merely highlight the continuing need for an adequately powered, well-designed, randomized controlled trial to interrogate this question further. ? 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery"

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HIV testing for all individuals with TB symptoms, but implementation has been suboptimal. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to estimate HIV and TB prevalence, and short-term (two to six?months) mortality, among adults with TB symptoms at community- and facility level. Methods: We searched Embase, Global Health and MEDLINE databases, and reviewed conference abstracts for studies reporting simultaneous HIV and TB screening of adults in LMICs published between January 2003 and December 2017. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate prevalence of HIV, undiagnosed TB and mortality risk at different health system levels. Results: Sixty-two studies including 260,792 symptomatic adults were identified, mostly from Africa and Asia. Median HIV prevalence was 19.2% (IQR: 8.3% to 40.4%) at community level, 55.7% (IQR: 20.9% to 71.2%) at primary care level and 80.7% (IQR: 73.8% to 84.6%) at hospital level. Median TB prevalence was 6.9% (IQR: 3.3% to 8.4%) at community, 20.5% (IQR: 11.7% to 46.4%) at primary care and 36.4% (IQR: 22.9% to 40.9%) at hospital level. Median short-term mortality was 22.6% (IQR: 15.6% to 27.7%) among inpatients, 3.1% (IQR: 1.2% to 4.2%) at primary care and 1.6% (95% CI: 0.45 to 4.13, n?=?1 study) at community level. Conclusions: Adults with TB symptoms have extremely high prevalence of HIV infection, even when identified through community surveys. TB prevalence and mortality increased substantially at primary care and inpatient level respectively. Strategies to expand symptom-based TB screening combined with HIV and TB testing for all symptomatic individuals should be of the highest priority for both disease programmes in LMICs with generalized HIV epidemics.

Although the incidence in the general population remains low, it is much higher in certain subgroups, including those living with human immunodeficiency virus and men who have sex with men. Approximately 90% of anal squamous cell cancers are caused by infection with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV). Given the common etiology between anal and cervical carcinogenesis, screening for anal cancer has been proposed in certain high-risk populations using strategies adapted from cervical cancer prevention. In this review, the authors discuss important differences in anal and cervical cancer regarding the populations at risk, disease natural history, and clinical procedures and outcomes that need to be considered when evaluating strategies for anal cancer screening. They also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of anal cytology, anal HPV testing, and various biomarkers for the detection of anal precancers and cancers. The implications of these performance estimates are summarized in the context of risk-based screening and management of anal precancers, and important research gaps are highlighted that need to be addressed to fully understand the benefits and harms of anal cancer screening.

Objective: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of targeted immunomodulators for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods: Systematic literature review of placebo-controlled and head-to-head randomized trials of 8 targeted immunomodulators that evaluated clinical benefits or harm. The primary outcome was a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index. We also conducted a network meta-analysis adjusted for placebo response to perform indirect comparisons between agents. Results: In the network meta-analysis, the targeted immunomodulators ordered by increasing relative risk (demonstrating greater likelihood) of achieving a 75% improvement on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index relative to placebo were as follows: apremilast (6.2), etanercept (9.6), adalimumab (13.0), ustekinumab (14.0), secukinumab (15.4), infliximab (16.2), brodalumab (17.3), and ixekizumab (17.9). Ixekizumab, brodalumab, and infliximab were all statistically superior to ustekinumab, adalimumab, etanercept, and apremilast; results were similar to those of head-to-head studies where data were available. Limitations: Much of the evidence is short-term (covering 10-16 weeks); limited direct comparisons.

Nonadherence to medications prescribed to treat those comorbid conditions may help explain this increased risk. We sought to determine the association between PTSD and medication nonadherence and whether it varied according to the type of event inducing the PTSD. Methods: Prospective observational cohort or cross-sectional studies relating PTSD and nonadherence among adults prescribed medications for a chronic medical illness were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and the PILOTS Database and by hand-searching bibliographies from selected articles. Individual estimates of odds ratios were pooled using random effects meta-analysis with inverse variance weighting. Articles were pooled separately according to whether PTSD was induced by a medical versus non-medical event. Outcomes: Sixteen articles comprising 4483 patients met eligibility criteria. The pooled effect size of the risk of PTSD to medication nonadherence was OR 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06¡V1.41). Among the 6 studies of medical event-induced PTSD, the OR was 2.08 (95% CI, 1.03¡V4.18); p = 0.04. Among the 8 studies in which PTSD was not induced by a medical event, the OR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99¡V1.24); p = 0.09. Interpretation: Patients with PTSD were more likely to be nonadherent to medications prescribed for chronic medical conditions ¡V an association that may exist specifically when PTSD was induced by a medical event.

Eight studies showed evidence of a positive association between recent IPV and subsequent depressive symptoms, with a pooled OR from five estimates of 1.76 (95% CI 1.26 to 2.44, I2 =37.5%, p=0.172). Five studies demonstrated a positive, statistically significant relationship between depressive symptoms and subsequent IPV; the pooled OR from two studies was 1.72 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.31, I2 =0.0%, p=0.752). Recent IPV was also associated with increased symptoms of subsequent postpartum depression in five studies (OR=2.19, 95% CI 1.39 to 3.45, p=0.000), although there was substantial heterogeneity. There was some evidence of a bidirectional relationship between recent IPV and hard drug use and marijuana use, although studies were limited. There was no evidence of an association between recent IPV and alcohol use or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although there were few studies and inconsistent measurement of alcohol and STIs. Conclusions: Exposure to violence has significant impacts. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the temporal relationship between recent IPV and different health issues, while considering the differential effects of recent versus past exposure to IPV. Improved measurement will enable an understanding of the immediate and longer term health needs of women exposed to IPV.

No significant differences were found between SILRC and CLRC in operative time, conversion, reoperation, perioperative complications, postoperative mortality, and 30-days readmission. Pathological outcomes, including lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, and distal resection margin, were similar. SILRC showed less estimated blood loss (weighted mean difference [WMD]: ?15.67 ml; 95% confidence interval [CI], ?24.36 to ?6.98; p = 0.0004), less skin incisions (WMD: ?1.56 cm; 95%CI, ?2.63 to ?0.49; p = 0.004) and shorter hospital stay (WMD: ?0.73d; 95%CI, ?1.04 to ?0.41; p < 0.00001), without publication bias. Conclusion: SILRC may provide a safe and feasible alternative to CLRC with similar short-term outcomes and aesthetic advantage of less skin incision. Well-designed randomized controlled trials, involving large cases and carrying long-term outcomes, are needed. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We examined peer-reviewed literature published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 to assess currently available evidence regarding HIV and four selected NCDs (cardiovascular disease, cervical cancer, depression, and diabetes) in LMICs with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Review, and Scopus, were searched to identify relevant literature. For conditions with adequate data available, pooled estimates for prevalence were generated using random fixed effects models. Results: Six thousand one hundred and forty-three abstracts were reviewed, 377 had potentially relevant prevalence data and 141 were included in the summary; 57 were selected for quantitative analysis. Pooled estimates for NCD prevalence were hypertension 21.2% (95% CI 16.3-27.1), hypercholesterolemia 22.2% (95% CI 14.7-32.1), elevated low-density lipoprotein 23.2% (95% CI 15.2-33.6), hypertriglyceridemia 27.2% (95% CI 20.7-34.8), low high-density lipoprotein 52.3% (95% CI 35.6-62.8), obesity 7.8% (95% CI 4.3-13.9), and depression 24.4% (95% CI 12.5-42.1). Invasive cervical cancer and diabetes prevalence were 1.3-1.7 and 1.3-18%, respectively. Few NCD-HIV integrated programs with screening and management approaches that are contextually appropriate for resource-limited settings exist. Conclusion: Improved data collection and surveillance of NCDs among PLHIV in LMICs are necessary to inform integrated HIV/NCD care models. Although efforts to integrate care exist, further research is needed to optimize the efficacy of these programs. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Nonambulatory stroke survivors (FAC score ?2) are at increased risk of recurrent stroke due to limited physical activity. This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence regarding case fatality, effects, experiences, and feasibility of fitness training for nonambulatory stroke survivors. Methods: Eight major databases were searched for any type of study design. Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality, using published tools. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. Following their separate analysis, qualitative and quantitative data were synthesized using a published framework. Results: Of 13,614 records, 33 studies involving 910 nonambulatory participants met inclusion criteria. Most studies were of moderate quality. Interventions comprised assisted walking (25 studies), cycle ergometer training (5 studies), and other training (3 studies), mainly in acute settings. Case fatality did not differ between intervention (1.75%) and control (0.88%) groups (95% CI 0.13¡V3.78, p?=?0.67). Compared with control interventions, assisted walking significantly improved: fat mass, peak heart rate, peak oxygen uptake and walking endurance, maximum walking speed, and mobility at intervention end, and walking endurance, balance, mobility, and independent walking at follow-up. Cycle ergometry significantly improved peak heart rate, work load, peak ventilation, peak carbon dioxide production, HDL cholesterol, fasting insulin and fasting glucose, and independence at intervention end. Effectiveness of other training could not be established. There were insufficient qualitative data to draw conclusions about participants' experiences, but those reported were positive. There were few intervention-related adverse events, and dropout rate ranged from 12 to 20%. Conclusions: Findings suggest safety, effectiveness, and feasibility of adapted fitness training for screened nonambulatory stroke survivors. Further research needs to investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness as well as experiences of fitness training¡Xespecially for chronic stroke survivors in community settings. ? 2018 The Authors.

Because of the low incidence rates of this disease worldwide, few clinical trials evaluating drug treatments have been conducted. Objectives: To conduct the first network meta-analysis simultaneously comparing all available drugs used in acromegaly treatment so as to provide more robust evidence in this field. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane Collaboration recommendations (PROSPERO database under the registration number CRD42017059880). The electronic searches were conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing any drug for the treatment of acromegaly head-to-head or versus placebo were included. Outcomes concerning the efficacy and safety of treatments were evaluated. The statistical analyses were performed using Aggregate Data Drug Information System version 1.16.8 (drugis.org, Groningen, The Netherlands). Results: The initial search retrieved 2059 articles. Of these, 10 randomized controlled trials were included in a qualitative analysis and 7 in a quantitative analysis. The network meta-analysis for the efficacy outcome (number of patients achieving insulinlike growth factor 1 control) showed that pegvisomant and lanreotide autogel were statistically superior to placebo (odds ratio [95% credible interval] 0.06 [0.00¡V0.55] and 0.09 [0.01¡V0.88]). No further differences were found. The probability rank indicated that pegvisomant and pasireotide have the highest probabilities (33% and 34%, respectively) of being the best therapeutic options. No major side effects were noted. Conclusions: Pegvisomant is still a good option for acromegaly treatment, but pasireotide seems to be a promising alternative. Nevertheless, other important key factors such as drug costs and effectiveness (real-world results) should be taken into account when selecting acromegaly treatment. ? 2018 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)"

Purpose: To assess whether when examining the entirety of existing data consecutive influenza vaccination reduces VE compared to current season influenza vaccination. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to April 26, 2017; citations of included studies. Study selection: Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies of children, adults and/or the elderly that reported laboratory-confirmed influenza infection over 2 or more consecutive influenza seasons were eligible. Data extraction: Data related to study characteristics, participant demographics, cases of influenza infection by vaccination group and risk of bias assessment was extracted in duplicate. Data synthesis: Five RCTs involving 11,987 participants did not show a significant reduction in VE when participants vaccinated in two consecutive seasons (VE 71%, 95% CI 62¡V78%) were compared to those vaccinated in the current season (VE 58%, 95% CI 48¡V66%) (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.62¡V1.26, p = 0.49, I2 = 39%). Twenty-eight observational studies involving 28,627 participants also did not show a reduction (VE for two consecutive seasons 41%, 95% CI 30¡V51% compared to VE for current season 47%, 95% CI 39¡V54%; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98¡V1.32, p = 0.09, I2 = 63%). Results from subgroup analyses by influenza type/subtype, vaccine type, age, vaccine match and co-morbidity support these findings; however, dose¡Vresponse results were inconsistent. Certainty in the evidence was assessed to be very low due to unexplained heterogeneity and imprecision. Limitations: The inclusion of studies with relatively small sample sizes and low event rates contributed to the imprecision of summary VE and OR estimates, which were based on unadjusted data. Conclusion: Available evidence does not support a reduction in VE with consecutive influenza vaccination, but the possibility of reduced effectiveness cannot be ruled out due to very low certainty in this evidence.

Recent recommendations from the World Health Organization and Center for Disease Control to routinely use high inspired oxygen concentrations to reduce infection risk have been widely criticized. We therefore performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of inspired oxygen on infection risk, including a recent large trial. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed. Primary analysis included all eligible trials. Sensitivity analyses distinguished studies of colorectal and non-colorectal surgeries, and excluded studies with high risk of bias. Another post-hoc sensitivity analysis excluded studies from one author that appear questionable. Results: The primary analysis included 26 trials (N=14,710). The RR [95%CI] for wound infection was 0.81 [0.70, 0.94] in the high vs. low inspired oxygen groups. The effect remained significant in colorectal patients (N=10,469), 0.79 [0.66, 0.96], but not in other patients (N=4,241), 0.86 [0.69, 1.09]. When restricting the analysis to studies with low risk of bias, either by strict inclusion criteria (N=5,047) or by researchers¡¦ judgment (N=12,547), no significant benefit remained: 0.84 [0.67, 1.06] and 0.89 [0.76, 1.05], respectively. Conclusions: When considering all available data, intraoperative hyperoxia reduced wound infection incidence. However, no significant benefit remained when analysis was restricted to objective- or investigator-identified low-bias studies, although those analyses were not as well-powered. Meta-analysis of the most reliable studies does not suggest that supplemental oxygen substantively reduces wound infection risk, but more research is needed to fully answer this question. ? 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia"

The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS) tool. Meta-analysis was completed using a bivariate model. Results A total of 11 eligible studies were included. The median QUADAS score was 13 (interquartile range 13 to 13) out of 14. Significant conflicts of interest were identified in five studies. The pooled sensitivity for the laboratory alpha-defensin test was 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 0.98) and the pooled specificity was 0.97 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.98) for four studies with a threshold level of 5.2 mgl-1 The pooled sensitivity for the lateral flow cassette test was 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.92) and the pooled specificity was 0.90 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98).

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare rates of post-operative complications in patients undergoing four pre-operative approaches (POA): preoperative biliary drainage with plastic stent (PBD-PS), metal stent (PBD-MS), and percutaneous transhepatic drain (PBD-PT), or no pre-operative biliary drainage (NPBD). Method: A study was included in the systematic review if it assessed the effects of PBD on post-operative outcomes in jaundiced patients with RPC. Endpoints were the rate of any post-operative complication, wound infection, intra-abdominal infection and post-operative bleeding. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to rank the POAs from the best to worst, for each outcome. Results: Thirty-two studies were included in the systematic review. Ten out of 32 studies included in the systematic review reported at least one of the 4 outcomes of interest and thus were used for NMA. The calculated odds ratios and P-scores ranked NPBD as the best approach. There was insufficient evidence to determine the best modality of PBD among PBD-PS, PBD-MS and PBD-PT.

Results: Eighteen case¡Vcontrol and three cohort studies published between 1963 and 2016 were eligible. Random-effects models showed that UTI was significantly associated with an increased BCa risk both in case¡Vcontrol studies (summary ORRE?=?2.33; 95% CI 1.86, 2.92) and cohort studies (summary RRRE?=?2.88; 95% CI 1.20, 6.89). The observed relationship of UTI with an increased BCa risk was independent of the study characteristics considered. No significant publication bias was detected. Conclusions: Chronic UTI was significantly and independently associated with an increased BCa risk. However, due to the presence of high?between-study heterogeneity and inconsistent patterns of adjusted confounding effects, more data are needed to clarify the role of chronic UTI in causation of BCa and if established, prompt and effective treatment of UTI may minimize a?substantial proportion of BCa risk. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

There are some evidences to suggest that Toxocara infection is a neglected risk factor for childhood asthma. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to further understanding of this relationship. Five databases include PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to October 2017) to identify the relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistic. A total of 17 studies including 11 studies with case-control design (1139 patients and 1023 controls) and six studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 5469 participants, 872 asthmatics, and 4597 non-asthmatics children) met the eligibility criteria. An increased risk for asthma was observed in children with Toxocara infection seropositivity (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.47¡V2.47). In sub-group analysis, the pooled ORs were (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.43¡V3.15) and (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.23¡V2.44) for case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Moreover, considering to specific IgE seropositivity, a pooled OR of 2.36 (95% CI, 0.93¡V5.98) was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that children infected with Toxocara spp. are more likely to have asthma compared to non-infected children. More studies (especially longitudinal studies) are needed to further investigate the impact of Toxocara spp. infection on the onset or development of asthma. ? 2018"

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2018,European Spine Journal,10.1007/s00586-018-5563-7,,"Purpose: To compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of irreducible atlantoaxial dislocation (IAAD) treated with posterior fusion after anterior release and direct posterior reduction of the dislocation. Methods: Online databases were searched for articles describing IAAD published from 1999 to 2015. Five studies (105 patients) described treatment with posterior fusion after periodontoid tissue release, and five studies (113 patients) described treatment with direct posterior reduction of the dislocation. The primary outcomes in this study were the complete reduction rate, Japanese Orthopedic Association score, perioperative morbidity, perioperative mortality, complications, vascular injury, and infection. Standard meta-analysis techniques were used to compare the outcomes. Results: Of 319 citations examined, 10 articles involving 218 participants were eligible. Overall, there were no significant differences between the anterior release and posterior fixation (ARPF) group and direct posterior reduction and fixation (DPRF) group in the complete reduction rate, neurologic recovery rate, perioperative morbidity, perioperative mortality, vascular injury, or infection. However, the complication rate in the DPRF group was much lower than that in the ARPF group. Conclusions: Compared with posterior fusion after anterior release, direct posterior reduction of the dislocation showed no significant differences in terms of the complete reduction rate, neurologic recovery rate, or fusion rate; however, it was a simpler process associated with less surgical trauma and a shorter operation time. Because of the limitations of the small sample in this study, whether direct posterior reduction of the dislocation is more effective and safer than posterior fusion after anterior release remains unclear.

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy of fosfomycin with quinolone-based antibiotic prophylaxis for TRUSBP. Methods: A systematic review in line with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and Cochrane guidelines was conducted. All studies comparing fosfomycin vs. non-fosfomycin antimicrobial prophylaxis for TRUSBP were considered. The main outcomes were number of urinary tract infections (UTIs) (overall, afebrile, febrile, and urosepsis) and fluoroqinolone resistance. Secondary outcomes were positive urine and blood cultures, and adverse effects of drugs. Results: Five studies comparing fosfomycin and non-fosfomycin antimicrobials were included in the review. In all, 1447 and 1665 patients were included in the fosfomycin and non-fosfomycin cohorts, respectively. The systematic review report significantly lower UTIs in the fosfomycin cohort (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI), 0.20 (0.13, 0.30), p < 0.00001. Urine cultures from patients given fosfomycin showed significantly lower resistance rates (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI) 0.27 (0.15, 0.50), p < 0.0001. The adverse effect profile between the two cohorts were similar (M-H, Fixed, 95% CI) 1.13 (0.51, 2.50), p = 0.33. On Grade Pro evaluation, overall UTI, afebrile UTI, febrile UTI, and urosepsis were rates as moderate, low, very low, and moderate quality evidence, respectively. Positive blood and urine culture were rated as moderate and very low-quality evidence, respectively. Fluoroquinolone resistance was rated as low-quality evidence. Adverse effects was rated as very low-quality evidence. Conclusions: This review suggests that fosfomycin has significantly lower septic complications with an equivalent side effect profile in comparison with quinolone-based prophylaxis regimen for TRUSBP. There is an urgent need for appropriate antibiotic stewardship and it is paramount that studies with robust methodology are developed to establish the role of fosfomycin over existing antibiotic regimens for TRUSBP. ? 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature."

A systematic review and meta-analysis on short-term surgical outcomes,2018,Wideochirurgia I Inne Techniki Maloinwazyjne,10.5114/wiitm.2018.75845,,"Introduction: Over the past years the incidence of colorectal cancers has increased worldwide. Currently it is the most common gastrointestinal malignancy worldwide. The laparoscopic approach has become the gold standard for surgical treatment. However, a recently published meta-analysis showed no difference in short- and long-term oncological outcomes of laparoscopy for treating rectal cancer. Aim: To assess current literature on short-term outcomes of rectal cancer treatment using laparoscopic surgery in comparison to the open approach. Material and methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to the PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcomes of interest were morbidity and short-term complications. Results: We identified 4,328 potential references. In the end we included 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We did not find any significant differences in terms of morbidity, haemorrhage, ureter injury, anastomotic leakage, mortality, intra-abdominal abscess or postoperative ileus. We found significant differences in the rate of surgical site infections, operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay and time to first bowel movement. Conclusions: This systematic review based on available RCTs confirms that laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery is associated with short-term outcomes comparable to the open approach. Moreover, in some aspects it provides better results (e.g. functional postoperative recovery, lower rate of surgical site infections (SSIs)). The quality of evidence is high; therefore in our opinion it is very unlikely that future trials will alter these results, and for this reason the laparoscopic approach can be considered the gold standard for the treatment of the majority of patients. ? 2018 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

It remains to be determined whether the 2 dominant operation techniques, full-endoscopic (FE) or microendoscopic (MI), are associated with fewer complications. Methods: An electronic retrieval from PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science was performed to identify comparative or single-arm studies concerning FE-PCF and MI-PCF. The pooled incidence of complications was calculated. Results: A total of 26 studies with 2028 patients (FE, 402; MI, 1626) were identified. The overall complication rate was 5.8% for FE-PCF and 3.5% for MI-PCF, with no significant difference (P = 0.115). The pooled complication rate for single-level radiculopathy showed no statistical difference (FE, 4.5%; MI, 3.5%; P = 0.471), either. However, constituent of complications showed apparent disparity, with transient root palsy in FE-PCF (15/19, 78.9%) and dural tear (20/47, 42.6%) in MI-PCF being the most commonly reported. As for the subgroup analysis, both incidence of dural tear (FE, 1.5%; MI, 1.8%; P = 0.672) and superficial wound infection (FE, 2.2%; MI, 1.0%; P = 0.109) showed no statistical difference. Nevertheless, transient root palsy occurred at a higher incidence in the FE group than in the MI group (FE, 4.5%; MI, 1.5%; P = 0.002). Conclusions: Both FE-PCF and MI-PCF can offer relatively safe treatment for cervical radiculopathy. There is no significant difference in overall complication rate between the 2 techniques. Dural tear is the most commonly reported complication of MI-PCF, whereas transient root palsy deserves to be noticed for surgeons performing FE-PCF. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

It is generally perceived as a more complex operation than extended hepatectomies (EH), with potentially higher associated morbidity. The outcomes of CH compared with EH is not well defined and there is a need to reassess. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science according to PRISMA guidelines for studies on the treatment of liver tumours with CH published from 1972 until February 2017. Outcomes of patients undergoing CH were assessed and compared to those undergoing EH. Results: 18 publications including 1380 CH were included for analysis. Mortality rates after CH ranged from 0 to 9%. There were 20 (1.4%) deaths after CH and the most common cause of death was post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Morbidity rates varied between 12 and 61% and 316 (23%) post-operative events were reported. Analysis of five comparative studies showed similar mortality between CH and EH groups (OR: 0.64, 95% CI = 0.24¡V1.70, p = 0.37). There were significantly fewer overall post-operative complications in the CH group (OR: 0.38, 95% CI = 0.28¡V0.51, p < 0.001) and reduced PHLF was found in the CH group compared to EH (OR: 0.53, 95% CI = 0.29¡V0.98, p = 0.04). The rates of post-hepatectomy biliary complications were similar between groups (OR: 0.98, 95% CI = 0.51¡V1.88, p = 0.96). Mean length of stay (days) was shorter in the CH group (MD: ?2.67, 95% CI = ?4.93 to ?0.41, p = 0.02). Conclusion: CH appears to have similar post-operative mortality rates compared to EH but is associated with fewer post-operative complications, including PHLF and shorter overall length of stay. ? 2017"

National and international vaccination programs, as the main means to prevent this infection, have been operating for years. This meta-analysis study was launched to investigate the vaccination efficacy in under five-year-old children in Iran. Evidence Acquisition: In this research, all national databases including, SID, Magiran, Iran medex, Iran doc, and Medlib, as well as international databases, including PubMed, Medline, and ISI were searched for published articles associated with evaluation of seroconversion rates after hepatitis-B vaccination in Iranian children. The search was performed in the Persian and/or English language and in under five-year-old children in Iran. The variance of each study was calculated using the binomial distribution formula. The results of studies were combined using random-effects meta-analysis model. Data were analyzed using STATA version 12. Results: In the present research, 11 studies, performed from 2000 to 2017, were investigated. The number of samples in these 11 studies were 3063 children (1592 males and 1471 females). In the studies, the efficacy range of the hepatitis-B vaccine in under fiveyear-old children in Iran was 89% (95% CI: 86% 93%) with high heterogeneity (P value for heterogeneity was 0.001, I2 = 92.9). Range of efficacy for males and females was 85% (95% CI: 78 to 91) and 88% (95% CI: 83 to 93), respectively. Conclusions: The hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination program in Iran seems to be highly effective although some questions, such as the effect of gender on responsiveness to vaccine and heterogeneity of different data, remain unclear. ? 2018, Hepatitis Monthly."

Purpose: The present study aims to compare the clinical outcomes, fusion rates, blood loss, and operative times between open posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF) alone and open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) + posterolateral fusion for spondylolisthesis. Study Design: This is a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of English language studies for the treatment of spondylolisthesis with PLF versus PLF + TLIF. Patient Sample: Data were obtained from published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective cohort studies. Outcome Measures: Clinical outcomes included Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), back pain, leg pain, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores. Fusion rate, operative time, blood loss, and infection rate were also assessed. Methods: A literature search of three electronic databases was performed to identify investigations performed comparing PLF alone with PLF + TLIF for treatment of low-grade lumbar spondylolisthesis. The summary effect size was assessed from pooling observational studies for each of the outcome variables, with odds ratios (ORs) used for fusion and infection rate, mean difference used for improvement in ODI and leg pain as well as operative time and blood loss, and standardized mean difference used for improvement in back pain and HRQOL outcomes. Studies were weighed based on the inverse of the variance and heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2¡Xan estimate of the error caused by between-study variation. Effect sizes from the meta-analysis were then compared with data from the RCTs to assess congruence in outcomes. Results: The initial literature search yielded 282 unique, English language studies. Seven were determined to meet our inclusion criteria and were included in our qualitative analysis. Five observational studies were included in our quantitative meta-analysis. The pooled fusion success rates were 84.7% (100/118) in the PLF group and 94.3% (116/123) in the TLIF group. Compared with TLIF patients, PLF patients had significantly lower odds of achieving solid arthrodesis (OR 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13¡V0.82, p=.02; I2=0%). With regard to improvement in back pain, the point estimate for the effect size was ?0.27 (95% CI ?0.43 to ?0.10, p=.002; I2=0%), in favor of the TLIF group. For ODI, the pooled estimate for the effect size was ?3.73 (95% CI ?7.09 to ?0.38, p=.03; I2=35%), significantly in favor of the TLIF group. Operative times were significantly shorter in the PLF group, with a summary effect size of ?25.55 (95% CI ?43.64 to ?7.45, p&lt;.01; I2=54%). No significant difference was observed in leg pain, HRQOL improvement, blood loss, or infection rate. Our meta-analysis results were consistent with RCTs, in favor of TLIF for achieving radiographic fusion and greater improvement in ODI and back pain. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that for patients undergoing fusion for spondylolisthesis, TLIF is superior to PLF with regard to achieving radiographic fusion. However, current data only provide weak support, if any, favoring TLIF over PLF for clinical improvement in disability and back pain. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Aims This study aims at evaluating the efficacy of interventions to promote sexual health, reduce STIs and unplanned pregnancies targeted to adolescents available after 2008; and analyzing the moderators of their global efficacy. Methods We searched electronic databases and manual searches of some journals focused on STIs in May 2016. The studies evaluated the efficacy of interventions to reduce sexual risk in adolescents (age range: 11¡V19) anywhere in the world. Effect size of the relevant outcomes for sexual risk was calculated for every study. Analyses incorporated random-effect assumptions for each outcome. The homogeneity in the results was examined with the I2 statistic and its associated 95% confident interval. Results Data from 63 studies (59,795 participants) were analyzed for behavioral and non-behavioral outcomes. In the short term, interventions had a positive impact in sexual health-related knowledge (Hedges¡¦g = 1.01), attitudes (g = 0.29), self-efficacy toward condom use (g = 0.22), intention to refuse sex (g = 0.56), condom use intention (g = 0.46), and condom use (g = 0.38). In the medium term, positive effects observed at the short-term were maintained, although effect size significantly decreased in all variables. In the long term, interventions improved condom use (g = 0.47). Moderators of the efficacy are discussed. Conclusions Sexual health promotion interventions are effective to promote sexual health through increasing condom use. Effects on non-behavioral variables tend to decrease over time, while condom use increased in the long-term. Interventions should focus on the long-term efficacy, especially in behavioral and biological measures. ? 2018 Morales et al.

However, Desarda technique (DT) appeared as promising tissue-based repair that provided low incidence of recurrence without the need for implanting prosthetic or foreign materials in the inguinal canal. This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DT and LT for primary inguinal hernia in adults aimed to determine which technique had better clinical outcome regarding recurrence and complication rates. Methods: A systematic literature search for RCTs comparing between DT and LT was conducted using electronic databases and Google scholar service. Patients¡¦ characteristics, technical details, recurrence and complication rates, and time to resume daily activities were extracted from the original studies and analyzed. Results: Six RCTs comprising 2159 patients (89% males) were included. No significant difference in the incidence of recurrence between both techniques was detected (OR?=?0.946; P?=?0.91). The overall complication rate of LT was significantly higher than DT (OR?=?1.86; P?<?0.001).

Therefore, we perform a meta-analysis from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical leech therapy in patients with knee OA. Materials and methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for literature up to January 2018. RCTs involving medical leech therapy in patients with knee OA were included. Two independent reviewers performed independent data abstraction. The I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. A fixed or random effects model was adopted for meta-analysis. All meta-analyses were performed by using STATA 12.0. Results: Four RCTs with 264 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The current meta-analysis showed that there were significant differences in terms of visual analogue scale (VAS) scores and WOMAC scores at 1 week, 4weeks and 7 weeks compared with control groups. However, leech therapy was associated with a significantly higher incidence of adverse events.

Our pooled data indicated that LIA was as effective as the FNB in terms of visual analog scale score for pain at 24 hours (P =.52), 48 hours (P =.36), and 72 hours (P =.27), and total morphine consumption (P =.27), range of motion (P =.45), knee society score (P =.51), complications (P =.81), and length of hospital stay (P =.75). Conclusions: Our current meta-analysis results demonstrated that there were no differences in efficacy between the FNB and LIA method. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Therefore, it is essential to provide safe blood supply to prevent transmission of infectious diseases. Current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the weighted prevalence of HIV in Iranian blood donors. Methods: This study was reported according to PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Required data were collected by using key words such as ¡§HIV¡¨, ¡§blood donation¡¨ OR ¡§blood donors¡¨, ¡§epidemiology¡¨ OR ¡§prevalence¡¨, ¡§blood transfusion¡¨ and ¡§Iran¡¨, in international databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, Embase and national databases including Magiran, IranMedex and Scientific Information Databank.

Results: A total of 49 studies including 5 403 170 donors entered this meta-analysis. According to analysis, the prevalence of HIV-positive patients among Iran blood donors was estimated 7.9/100 000 (95% CI: 0.000052-0.000121%). The highest prevalence was related to the central region of Iran (11.3/100,000 [95% CI:0.000063-0.0002%]) and Kermanshah province (49.2/100 000 [95% CI:0.000273-0.000888%]) and the lowest prevalence was related to the eastern region (1/100 000 [95% CI:0.000001-0.000072%]) and Khorasan Razavi province (0.9/100 000 [95% CI:0.000001-0.000139%]. Conclusion: The overall HIV prevalence in Iranian blood donors is low and satisfying. However, the high prevalence in some regions and provinces should be reviewed more meticulously. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Methods: English and French published articles indexed in EBSCOhost, PubMed, Web of Science, and African Journals Online were retrieved, with searches being conducted up to August, 2015. Data were pooled and meta-analysis performed using a random-effects model, and the results are described as event rates. Results: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles out of the 852 retrieved were eligible for the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The studies included were mainly conducted in Nigeria, with Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. being the main bacteria. The pooled estimates showed high level of antibiotic resistance (ABR) (86%; p < 0.001) and multidrug resistance (73%; p = 0.003). Conclusion: Our results suggest that ABR is substantively prevalent and poses a serious threat for food safety and security in Africa. These findings shed light on areas for future research concerning antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant bacteria in food animals as etiological agents of infectious diseases in humans. They further yielded some interesting findings on the burden of ABR that could be useful in developing measures to contain this threat in the farm-to-plate continuum in Africa. ?

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the etiology of bacterial meningitis in different age groups across global regions. PubMed and EMBASE were systematically searched for English language studies on bacterial meningitis, limited to articles published in the last five years. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a customized scoring system. Meta-analyses were conducted to determine the frequency (percentages) of seven bacterial types known to cause meningitis: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, with results being stratified by six geographical regions as determined by the World Health Organization, and seven age groups. Of the 3227 studies retrieved, 56 were eligible for the final analysis. In all age groups, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis were the predominant pathogens in all regions, accounting for 25.1¡V41.2% and 9.1¡V36.2% of bacterial meningitis cases, respectively. S. pneumoniae infection was the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the ¡¥all children¡¦ group, ranging from 22.5% (Europe) to 41.1% (Africa), and in all adults ranging from 9.6% (Western Pacific) to 75.2% (Africa). E. coli and S. pneumoniae were the most common pathogens that caused bacterial meningitis in neonates in Africa (17.7% and 20.4%, respectively). N. meningitidis was the most common in children aged ¡Ó1¡V5 years in Europe (47.0%). Due to paucity of data, meta-analyses could not be performed in all age groups for all regions. A clear difference in the weighted frequency of bacterial meningitis cases caused by the different etiological agents was observed between age groups and between geographic regions. These findings may facilitate bacterial meningitis prevention and treatment strategies. ? 2018 Oordt-Speets et al.

We determined the prevalence of CKD in adult populations living in Africa, and variations by stage, gender, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) equation, and residence. Methods: For this systematic review, we searched multiple electronic databases for original studies on CKD prevalence reported from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2016. Two reviewers independently undertook quality assessment and data extraction. We stabilized the variance of study-specific estimates with the Freeman-Turkey single arcsine transformation and pooled the data using a random effects meta-analysis models. Results: A total of 98 studies involving 98,432 individuals were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall prevalence was 15.8% (95% CI 12.1-19.9) for CKD stages 1-5 and 4.6% (3.3-6.1) for CKD stages 3-5 in the general population. Equivalent figures were greater at 32.3% (23.4-41.8) and 13.3% (10.7-16.0) in high-risk populations (people with hypertension, diabetes, HIV). CKD prevalence was higher in studies based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula than MDRD or CKD-EPI equations; and in studies from sub-Saharan Africa compared with those from North Africa (17.7, 95% CI 13.7-22.1 vs 6.1, 95% CI 3.6-9.3, p &lt; 0.001). There was substantial heterogeneity across studies (all I2 &gt; 90%) and no evidence of publication bias in main analyses.

Methods We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their earliest records to May 2017. RCTs comparing the TPO-RAs with placebo in adult ITP were included. Primary outcomes were the overall response rate. Secondary outcomes included safety, durable response, overall or clinically significant bleeding, and the proportion of patients receiving rescue medication. Results Nine randomized placebo-controlled trials (786 participants) were included in this systematic review. Overall response [Risk Ratio(RR) = 0.59, 95%Confidence Interval(CI): 0.24¡V1.45], the incidence of adverse events (RR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.79¡V1.21), durable response (RR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.08¡V2.81), the incidence of overall bleeding (RR = 1.15, 95%CI: 0.52¡V2.57) and clinically significant bleeding (RR = 1.09, 95%CI: 0.37¡V3.24), and the proportion of patients receiving rescue treatment (RR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.47¡V1.90) were similar between eltrombopag and romiplostim. Conclusions Eltrombopag and romiplostim might be equivalent in efficacy and safety for adult ITP, however, physicians should still take into account drug cost and comorbidities of the specific patient while making decisions on the treatment of ITP with TPO-RAs. ? 2018 Zhang et al.

It remains unclear, however, which are the best combinations, and which features of second-line treatments are related to better cure rates. The aim of this study was to determine that second-line treatments achieved excellent (>90%) cure rates by performing a systematic review and when possible a meta-analysis. A meta-regression was planned to determine the characteristics of treatments achieving excellent cure rates. Methods: A systematic review for studies evaluating second-line Helicobacter pylori treatment was carried out in multiple databases. A formal meta-analysis was performed when an adequate number of comparative studies was found, using RevMan5.3. A meta-regression for evaluating factors predicting cure rates >90% was performed using Stata Statistical Software. Results: The systematic review identified 115 eligible studies, including 203 evaluable treatment arms. The results were extremely heterogeneous, with 61 treatment arms (30%) achieving optimal (>90%) cure rates. The meta-analysis favored quadruple therapies over triple (83.2% vs 76.1%, OR: 0.59:0.38-0.93; P?=.02) and 14-day quadruple treatments over 7-day treatments (91.2% vs 81.5%, OR; 95% CI: 0.42:0.24-0.73; P?=.002), although the differences were significant only in the per-protocol analysis. The meta-regression did not find any particular characteristics of the studies to be associated with excellent cure rates. Conclusion: Second-line Helicobacter pylori treatments achieving>90% cure rates are extremely heterogeneous. Quadruple therapy and 14-day treatments seem better than triple therapies and 7-day ones. No single characteristic of the treatments was related to excellent cure rates.

We present here a systematic review and a multiple-treatment meta-analysis evaluating the operative outcomes and patient-reported outcomes of open/microdiscectomy (OD/MD) and all MIS approaches for lumbar disc herniation. Methods: The PICO approach and PRISMA (i.e., Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed to query existing online databases since their inception to 2016, which yielded 14 studies after we applied the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias in each study was used to assess the risk of bias in each study. Each outcome was assessed across all studies with the GRADE (i.e., Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) criteria. Results: There were 1707 patients analyzed, with 782 (45.81%) undergoing OD/MD, 491 (28.76%) undergoing TD, 199 (11.65%) undergoing percutaneous endoscopic discectomy, and 235 (13.76%) patients undergoing percutaneous discectomy. TD was found to be associated with significantly worse Oswestry Disability Index scores (mean difference 1.17, P = 0.03) whereas OD/MD was associated with worse Oswestry Disability Index scores compared with all other approaches (mean difference 2.61, P = 0.03), significantly longer duration of stay (mean difference 2.96, P = 0.04), and more blood loss (mean difference 30.53, P < 0.001). In terms of complications, TD was found to be associated with a greater rate of overall complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, P = 0.002), greater incidence of dural tears (OR 1.72 P = 0.04), and recurrent herniation (OR 2.09, P = 0.0007). Finally, OD/MD was associated with significantly lower incidence of revision surgery (OR 0.53, P = 0.0007). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis revealed that tubular-discectomy and percutaneous-endoscopic-discectomy, the most commonly employed MIS techniques for discectomy, can be used as safe alternatives for open discectomy depending on the preference of the operating surgeon. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

Methods: PubMed and ISI Web of Science were searched from inception to October 2016, to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies examining associations between genetic or non-genetic risk factors and PE. For each meta-analysis, the summary-effect size was estimated using random-effects and fixed-effects models, along with 95% CIs and the 95% prediction interval. Between-study heterogeneity was expressed using the I2 statistic, and evidence of small-study effects (large studies had significantly more conservative results than smaller studies) and evidence of excess significance bias (too many studies with statistically significant results) were estimated. Results: Fifty-eight eligible meta-analyses were identified, which included 1466 primary studies and provided data on 130 comparisons of risk factors associated with PE, covering a wide range of comorbid diseases, genetic factors, exposure to environmental agents and biomarkers. Sixty-five (50%) associations had nominally statistically significant findings at P &lt; 0.05, while 16 (12%) were significant at P &lt; 10¡V6. Sixty-five (50%) associations had large or very large heterogeneity. Evidence for small-study effects and excess significance bias was found in 10 (8%) and 26 (20%) associations, respectively. The only non-genetic risk factor with convincing evidence for an association with PE was oocyte donation vs spontaneous conception, which had a summary odds ratio of 4.33 (95% CI, 3.11¡V6.03), was supported by 2712 cases with small heterogeneity (I2 = 26%) and 95% prediction intervals excluding the null value, and without hints of small-study effects (P for Egger's test &gt; 0.10) or excess of significance (P &gt; 0.05). Of the statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) genetic risk factors for PE, only PAI-1 4G/5G (recessive model) polymorphism was supported by strong evidence for a contribution to the pathogenesis of PE. Eleven factors (serum iron level, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A, chronic kidney disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, mental stress, bacterial and viral infections, cigarette smoking, oocyte donation vs assisted reproductive technology, obesity vs normal weight, severe obesity vs normal weight and primiparity) presented highly suggestive evidence for an association with PE. Conclusions: A large proportion of meta-analyses of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for PE have caveats that threaten their validity. Oocyte donation vs spontaneous conception and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism (recessive model) showed the strongest consistent evidence for an association with risk for PE. Copyright ? 2017 ISUOG.

However, there remains substantial uncertainty about the attack rate (incidence) of influenza, particularly in unvaccinated individuals. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of vaccine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza in the placebo arm. We calculated the influenza attack rate from included studies as the number of laboratory-confirmed positive seasonal influenza cases in the placebo arm divided by the total number of subjects in this arm. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the influenza attack rate among unvaccinated individuals (both symptomatic only as well as symptomatic and asymptomatic combined). Results: We included 32 RCTs that had a total of 13,329 participants. The pooled estimates for symptomatic influenza were 12.7% (95%CI 8.5%, 18.6%) for children (<18 years), 4.4% (95%CI 3.0%, 6.3%) for adults, and 7.2% (95%CI 4.3%, 12.0%) for older people (65 years and above). The pooled estimates for symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza combined for all influenza were 22.5% (95%CI 9.0%, 46.0%) for children and 10.7% (95%CI 4.5%, 23.2%) for adults. Only one study was identified for symptomatic and asymptomatic combined in older people which had a rate of 8.8% (95%CI 7.0%, 10.8%). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Conclusion: Overall, we found that approximately 1 in 5 unvaccinated children and 1 in 10 unvaccinated adults were estimated to be infected by seasonal influenza annually, with rates of symptomatic influenza roughly half of these estimates.

We performed a meta-analysis to assess the prognostic benefits of restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: We identified randomized clinical trials through the 9th of December 2017 that investigated a restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy versus a liberal transfusion strategy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Individual patient data from each study were collected. Meta-analyses were performed for the primary and secondary outcomes. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A trial sequential analysis (TSA)-adjusted random-effects model was used to pool the results from the included studies for the primary outcomes. Results: Seven trials involving a total of 8886 patients were included. The TSA evaluations suggested that this meta-analysis could draw firm negative results, and the data were sufficient. There was no evidence that the risk of 30-day mortality differed between the patients assigned to a restrictive blood cell transfusion strategy and a liberal transfusion strategy (odds ratio (OR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.24; p=0.87). Furthermore, the study suggested that the restrictive transfusion strategy was not associated with significant increases in pulmonary morbidity (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.34; p=0.44), postoperative infection (OR 1.11; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.3; p=0.58), acute kidney injury (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.14; p=0.71), acute myocardial infarction (OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; p=0.78), or cerebrovascular accidents (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.30; p=0.66). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy was not inferior to the liberal strategy with respect to 30-day mortality, pulmonary morbidity, postoperative infection, cerebrovascular accidents, acute kidney injury, or acute myocardial infarction, and fewer red blood cells were transfused. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Both non-Group A streptococcal (non-GAS) pharyngitis and Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis are commonly found in patients with sore throat. It is not known whether or not they present with similar signs and symptoms compared to patients with non-streptococcal pharyngitis. Methods. MEDLINE was searched for prospective studies that reported throat culture for both GAS and non-GAS as a reference standard, and reported at least one sign, symptom, or the Centor score. Summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-), and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created for key signs and symptoms. Results. Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Tonsillar exudate had the highest LR+ for both GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis (1.53 versus 1.71). The confidence intervals of sensitivity, LR+, LR-, and DOR for all signs, symptoms, and the Centor score between two groups overlapped, with the relative difference between sensitivities within 15% for arthralgia or myalgia, fever, injected throat, tonsillar enlargement, and tonsillar exudate. Larger differences in sensitivities were observed for sore throat, cervical adenopathy, and lack of a cough, although the difference for lack of a cough largely due to a single outlier. Discussion. Signs and symptoms of patients with GAS and non-GAS pharyngitis are generally similar. No signs or symptoms clearly distinguish GAS from non-GAS infection. Further work is needed to determine whether Group C streptococcus is a pathogen that should be treated. ? The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."

Numerous public health interventions have focused on reducing exposure to O. viverrini, but incidence of CCA in the region remains high. While this may indicate the inefficacy of public health interventions due to complex social and cultural factors, it may further indicate other risk factors or interactions with the parasite are important in pathogenesis of CCA. This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of described risk factors for CCA in addition to O. viverrini to guide future integrative interventions. Main body: We searched five international and seven Thai research databases to identify studies relevant to risk factors for CCA in the lower Mekong region. Selected studies were assessed for risk of bias and quality in terms of study design, population, CCA diagnostic methods, and statistical methods. The final 18 included studies reported numerous risk factors which were grouped into behaviors, socioeconomics, diet, genetics, gender, immune response, other infections, and treatment for O. viverrini. Seventeen risk factors were reported by two or more studies and were assessed with random effects models during meta-analysis. This meta-analysis indicates that the combination of alcohol and smoking (OR=11.1, 95% CI: 5.63-21.92, P< 0.0001) is most significantly associated with increased risk for CCA and is an even greater risk factor than O. viverrini exposure. This analysis also suggests that family history of cancer, consumption of raw cyprinoid fish, consumption of high nitrate foods, and praziquantel treatment are associated with significantly increased risk. These risk factors may have complex relationships with the host, parasite, or pathogenesis of CCA, and many of these risk factors were found to interact with each other in one or more studies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a complex variety of risk factors in addition to O. viverrini infection should be addressed in future public health interventions to reduce CCA in affected regions. In particular, smoking and alcohol use, dietary patterns, and socioeconomic factors should be considered when developing intervention programs to reduce CCA. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Regarding reduction in total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores (primary outcome), both deutetrabenazine (k=2, n=413, standardized mean difference [SMD] =-0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] =-0.19,-0.62, p<0.001; weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1.44, 95% CI =-0.67,-2.19, p<0.001) and valbenazine (k=4, n=421, SMD =-0.58, 95% CI =-0.26,-0.91, p<0.001; WMD =-2.07, 95% CI =-1.08,-3.05, p<0.001) significantly outperformed placebo. Results were confirmed regarding responder rates (?50% AIMS total score reduction; deutetrabenazine: risk ratio [RR] =2.13, 95% CI =1.10, 4.12, p=0.024, number-needed-to-treat [NNT] =7, 95% CI =3, 333, p=0.046; valbenazine: RR =3.05, 95% CI =1.81, 5.11, p<0.001, NNT =4, 95% CI =3, 6, p<0.001). Less consistent results emerged from patient-rated global impression-based response (p=0.15) and clinical global impression for deutetrabenazine (p=0.088), and for clinical global impression change for valbenazine (p=0.67). In an open-label extension (OLE) study of deutetrabenazine (?54 weeks) and a dose-blinded valbenazine study (?48 weeks), responder rates increased over time. With valbenazine, discontinuation effects were studied, showing TD symptom recurrence towards baseline severity levels within 4 weeks after valbenazine withdrawal. No increased cumulative or specific adverse (AEs) events versus placebo (acute trials) in extension versus acute trial data were observed. Conclusion: The 2 VMAT-2 inhibitors, valbenazine and deutetrabenazine, are effective in treating TD, both acutely and long-term, without concerns about increased risk of depression or suicide in the TD population. No head-to-head comparison among VMAT-2 inhibitors and no high-quality, meta-analyzable data are available for tetrabenazine in patients with TD. ? 2018 Solmi et al."

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, ISI Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IIT to CIT in patients with TBI. Study-level characteristics, intensive care unit (ICU) events, and long-term functional outcomes were extracted from the articles. Meta-analysis was performed with random-effect models. Results: Seven RCTs comprising 1070 patients were included. Although IIT was associated with better neurologic outcome (GOS &gt; 3) (RR=0.87, 95% CI=0.78-0.97; P=0.01; I2=0%), sensitivity analysis revealed that one study influenced this overall estimate (RR=0.90, 95% CI=0.80¡V1.01, P=0.07; I2=0%). IIT was strongly associated with higher risk of hypoglycaemia (RR=5.79, 95% CI=3.27¡V10.26, P&lt;0.01; I2=38%). IIT and CIT did not differ in terms of early or late mortality (RR=0.96, 95% CI=0.79¡V1.17, P=0.7; I2=0%), infection rate (RR=0.82, 95% CI=0.59¡V1.14, P=0.23; I2=68%), or ICU length of stay (SMD= ¡V0.14, 95% CI=¡V0.35 to 0.07, P=0.18; I2=45%0.)

Prison represents a high-risk environment for prisoners, in that it is characterized by high-risk behaviors such as injecting drug use (IDU), tattooing, unprotected sexual intercourses, or sharing syringes. The aim of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the prevalence of HCV among Iranian prisoners conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched different scholarly databases including Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI/Web of Sciences, the Cochrane library, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO as well as Iranian bibliographic thesauri (namely, Barakatns, MagIran, and SID) up to December 2017. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of the studies included. HCV prevalence rate with its 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. Egger's regression test was used to evaluate publication bias. Results: Finally, 17 articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Overall, 18,693 prisoners were tested. Based on the random-effects model, the prevalence of HCV among Iranian prisoners was 28% (CI 95% 21-36) with heterogeneity of I 2 = 99.3% (p = 0.00). All studies used an ELISA test for the evaluation of HCV antibodies. The findings of this study showed that the highest prevalence rate (53%) was among prisoners who inject drugs. Conclusion: The findings of our study showed that the prevalence of HCV among Iranian prisoners is dramatically high. Managing this issue in Iran's prisons requires careful attention to the availability of health facilities and instruments, such as screening, and harm reduction policies, such as giving sterile syringes and needles to prisoners. An integrated program of training for prisoners, prison personnel and medical staff is also needed to improve the level of health condition in prisons. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

The prevalence of HIV in people with SMDs is higher in females than in males. Unlike HIV, the prevalence of HBV and HCV is higher in males than in females. This study aimed to carry out a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and estimated gender difference in the risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD. Methods: Literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus. Publications were screened according to predefined inclusion criteria. A qualitative and quantitative analysis was undertaken for this systematic review. Eighteen materials published from 1993 to 2017 were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Random-effect model was used to calculate weighted prevalence, odds ratio (OR), and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: 12,290 citations were identified and 18 articles including 11,175 participants were included. The results of our meta-analysis show that the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD was 7.59% (95% CI 4.82-11.75), 15.63% (95% CI 7.19-30.69), and 7.21% (95% CI 4.44-11.50), respectively. The prevalence of HIV was higher in women (8.25%) than men (7.04%), but the prevalence of HBV and HCV was higher in men than women (18.91% versus 12.02% and 9.16% versus 5.43% for HBV and HCV in men versus women, respectively). A meta-analysis of included studies demonstrated a significantly increased risk of HBV (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.17-2.53) and HCV (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.16-3.20) infections in men compared to women in people with SMD. However, no significant association was observed between gender and HIV. The funnel plot and Egger's regression tests provided no evidence of substantial publication bias in the prevalence and gender difference in association for HIV, HBV, and HCV in people with SMD. Conclusions: In our review, the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV was high. The prevalence of HBV is significantly higher than HIV and HCV. There was a significantly increased risk of HBV and HCV infections in men compared to women. No significant association was observed between gender and HIV. People with SMDs warrant greater emphasis in efforts to identify and treat HIV, HBV and HCV. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

The aim of this systematic review was to examine differences in recurrence of cancer, impact on oncological treatment, health related quality of life, complications and aesthetic outcome between matrix and no matrix in immediate breast reconstruction. Systematic searches, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were performed according to predetermined criteria. Fifty-one studies were eligible and included in the review. The certainty of evidence for overall complication rate and implant loss is low (GRADE ¡ò¡ò¡¼ ¡¼).

It is caused by several parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. National estimates of the disease prevalence in livestock and tsetse flies are lacking, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to understand the trend of the disease prevalence over the years. Methods: Publications were screened in Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE and PubMed databases. Using four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRIMSA checklist, only studies that met the inclusion criteria for AAT and tsetse infections were analysed. Point estimates prevalence and subgroup analyses based on diagnostic techniques in livestock were evaluated at 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 74 eligible studies published between 1960 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis. This covers the six geopolitical zones, involving a total of 53,924 animals. The overall prevalence of AAT was 16.1% (95% CI: 12.3-20.3%). Based on diagnostic techniques, the prevalence of AAT in cattle was highest in PCR followed by serology and microscopy while the highest prevalence in pigs was observed with serology. Out of 12,552 tsetse flies examined from 14 eligible studies, an overall prevalence of 17.3% (95% CI: 4.5-36.0%) and subgroup prevalence of 49.7% (95% CI: 30.7-68.8%), 11.5% (95% CI: 6.1-18.5) and 4.5% (95% CI: 1.8-8.8%) in G. morsitans, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis, respectively, were observed using the random effects-model. Conclusions: The prevalence of trypanosomes in both vectors and animal hosts was high in Nigeria. Therefore, further research on risk factors, seasonal and transhumance effects, vectoral capacity and competence are warranted for an effective control of AAT in Nigeria. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

It is debatable whether H. pylori infection exacerbates or triggers the pathogenesis of psoriasis. This meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between psoriasis and H. pylori infection. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed from inception through October 2017. The inclusion criterion was observational studies evaluating the association between psoriasis and H. pylori infection. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of H. pylori infection and their 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis to compare risk between psoriasis patients and controls. The between-study heterogeneity of effect-size was quantified using the Q statistic and I2. Results: Data were extracted from nine observational studies involving 1546 individuals. Pooled result demonstrated an increased H. pylori infection in psoriasis compared with controls (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.02-2.46, P=0.04, I2=64%).

Methods: A systematic literature search with no limits was performed in PubMed, and Ovid. The last search was performed on June 6, 2017. The outcomes of interests included intraoperative outcomes, pathological outcomes, postoperative outcomes, and survival outcomes. Results: Twenty-one articles published between 1997 and 2016 with a total of 20,343 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. Compared with OAPR, LAPR showed comparable operative time, less blood loss and intraoperative blood transfusion, smaller length of hospital day and postoperative hospital day, faster recovery of bowel functions, and less postoperative complications, especially less abdominal wound infection. As for pathological outcomes, LAPR was not inferior to OAPR. Besides, LAPR was comparable to OAPR in recurrence rate, 3-year survivals and 5-year survivals. Conclusions: LAPR can reduce postoperative complications, lead faster postoperative recovery. In addition, LAPR is not inferior to OAPR in terms of oncological clearance, recurrence rate, and long-time survivals. So LAPR is safe and feasible for RC treatment. Further, more perspective randomized trials can be conducted to compare LAPR and OAPR in the future. ? Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

PURPOSE: Systematic review to compare outcomes of shorter versus longer antibiotic courses among hospitalized adults and adolescents. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Embase databases, 1990-2017. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria were human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in English comparing a prespecified short course of antibiotics to a longer course for treatment of infection in hospitalized adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently extracted study characteristics, methods of statistical analysis, outcomes, and risk of bias. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 5187 unique citations identified, 19 RCTs comprising 2867 patients met our inclusion criteria, including the following: 9 noninferiority trials, 1 superiority design trial, and 9 pilot studies. Across 13 studies evaluating 1727 patients, no significant difference in clinical efficacy was observed (d = 1.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), ?1.0%-4.2%]). No significant difference was detected in microbiologic cure (8 studies, d = 1.2% [95% CI, ?4.1%-6.4%]), short-term mortality (8 studies, d = 0.3% [95% CI, ?1.2%-1.8%]), longer-term mortality (3 studies, d = ?0.4% [95% CI, ?6.3%-5.5%]), or recurrence (10 studies, d = 2.1% [95% CI, ?1.2%-5.3%]).

Methods: A systematic search was conducted including papers assessing more effective cutoffs for synovial fluid tests, having comparative design, evaluating an exclusive cohort of hip or knee prostheses, including a clear definition of infected cases, and reporting sufficient data for the calculation of true-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative. Results: A total of 375 articles were collected and, given the inclusion criteria, ten manuscripts were included. These studies assessed 1155 hip prostheses (276 infected cases) and 1235 knee prostheses (401 infected cases). The specificity of synovial fluid white blood cell count was significantly increased by using the threshold value ? 3000 cell/£gL (p = 0.006); the sensitivity of polymorphonucleate percentage was significantly higher in detecting knee infections (p = 0.034). Discussion: Both tests had a high specificity and sensitivity in detecting periprosthetic joint infections, and no clear superiority of one over the other existed. Furthermore, cutoff and anatomic site significantly influenced synovial fluid white blood cell count and polymorphonucleate percentage, respectively. Conclusion: Synovial fluid analysis is adequate in differentiating patients with periprosthetic hip and knee infections. Our data confirms international guidelines suggesting the use of 3000 cell/£gL as cutoff threshold for synovial fluid white blood cell count. Since an anatomic site effect has been demonstrated, the goal of future studies will be to identify different cutoffs for hip and knee prostheses. ? 2018, SICOT aisbl."

The current systematic review was designed to clarify the detailed advantages and disadvantages of the negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in treatment of open fractures in comparison with the conventional wound dressings. Methods: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar for the published relevant clinical studies. Unpublished studies were searched in Clinicaltrials, ICTRP and ISRCTN. The outcome measures included presence of infection, wound healing process, length of the patient hospital stay, flap issues, frequency of amputation, and patient life quality. Results: In the 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (421 patients) and the 6 retrospective cohort studies (488 patients), NPWT resulted in a significantly lower infection rate, significantly shorter wound coverage time, wound healing time and hospital stay length, and the lower amputation rate. However, no statistically significant difference was found in the need for flap surgery, the proportion of free flaps, the flap failure rate or the fracture non-union rate. Only 1 RCT was reported to have a higher physical component score of short form 36 in the infected patients. Conclusion: NPWT can significantly reduce the risk of infection in treatment of open fractures and accelerate their wound healing process. Some but not much evidence suggests that NPWT may possibly help reduce the severity of the limb injury and therefore provide a chance for the limb to avoid amputation. Use of NPWT in the flap area is probably safe, but should be carried out with caution. The advantage of NPWT over the conventional wound dressings still requires to be confirmed in the other aspects. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

The mean difference in rate of CRBSIs was 6.27 per 1000 catheter days (95% CI, 4.89¡V7.66) favoring ethanol locks, with a 63% overall reduction in infection rate. The mean difference in catheter replacement rate (per 1000 catheter days) was 4.56 (95% Cl, 2.68¡V6.43) favoring ethanol locks. The overall effect on catheter repair rate (per 1000 catheter days) was ?1.67 (95% CI, ?2.30 to ?1.05), indicating lower repair rate with heparin locks. Conclusion: Sufficient evidence was noted showing that ethanol locks reduced CRBSIs and catheter replacements. Our findings raise questions about the effect of the ethanol lock on catheter integrity based on the noted increase in repair rate. This requires further prospective evaluation and may support selective application of ethanol locks to patients with documented CRBSIs. ? 2017 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition"

Because of lack of vaccination, various studies investigated the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drugs and supportive remedies. A systematic literature search from 10 databases was conducted and screened for relevant articles. Studies reporting information about the treatment of MERS coronavirus infection were extracted and analyzed. Despite receiving treatment with ribavirin plus IFN, the case fatality rate was as high as 71% in the IFN-treatment group and exactly the same in patients who received supportive treatment only. Having chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension increased the risk of mortality (P?<.05), and chronic renal disease is the best parameter to predict the mortality. The mean of survival days from onset of illness to death was 46.6 (95% CI, 30.5-62.6) for the IFN group compared with 18.8 (95% CI, 10.3-27.4) for the supportive-only group (P?=.001). Delay in starting treatment, older age group, and preexisting comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes. In conclusion, there is no difference between IFN treatment and supportive treatment for MERS patients in terms of mortality. However, ribavirin and IFN combination might have efficacious effects with timely administration and monitoring of adverse events. Large-scale prospective randomized studies are required to assess the role of antiviral drugs for the treatment of this high mortality infection. Copyright ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

There are studies on the prevalence of this infection in animal and human reservoirs in Iran; hence, we conducted this meta-analysis to elucidate the prevalence of CE in Iran. English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex, Iran Doc and SID) databases were explored. In the case of definitive, animal and human intermediate hosts, 37, 90 and 33 studies, respectively, have been included in the current review from January 1990 to December 2015. According to outcomes of the heterogeneity test, either Der Simonian and Laird's random-effects method or Mantel-Haenszel's fixed-effects method were employed to pool the estimations. The pooled prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus infection in definitive hosts was calculated as 23.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 17.6-30.1%). The weighted prevalence of animal and human hydatidosis was calculated as 15.6% (95% CI = 14.2-17.1%) and 4.2% (95% CI = 3.0-5.5%), respectively. Meanwhile, most cases of human hydatidosis were in southern Iran, with a prevalence of 5.8% (3.2-9.2%). In terms of human hydatidosis, more infections were found in rural regions, and mostly in female individuals. Egger's regression test revealed publication bias, with a remarkable impact on total prevalence of the infection in animal intermediate hosts (P < 0.001), while it was not significant in human hosts (P = 0.4) and definitive hosts (P = 0.3). According to the weighted estimated prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and its financial burden, implementing appropriate control programmes should be compulsory to decrease the burden of the disease in Iran. ?

A meta-regression was performed with 4 factors: patients¡¦ age, presence of prosthetic-duodenal fistula (PDF), virulent organisms, or nonvirulent organisms. Results: In situ reconstruction over EAR seems to favor all events. For the 5 conduits used for ISR, according to operative mortality, age of the patients looks to have a positive correlation only for silver polyester and no conduit present any advantage in the presence of PDF. Reinfection seems to be not significantly different for the 5 conduits, and only autogenous veins appear to have a positive correlation with infecting organisms.

This meta-analysis assesses and compares the outcomes and attempts to identify the best approach for hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of proximal femoral fractures. Methods: An electronic search was performed from inception to October 25, 2017, for comparative studies including at least 2 of the conventional approaches. Outcomes including operation time, surgical blood loss, perioperative fractures, wound infections, dislocations, and hospital length of stay were plotted in forest plots. Results: Twenty-one eligible studies were selected including 3 randomized, controlled trials, 7 prospective and 11 retrospective cohort studies. The odds ratio (OR) for dislocations was significantly higher for the PA compared with the AA (OR, 2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 5.43; P =.01) and the LA (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.63 to 5.14; P =.0003).

Considering the high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) presented by clinical trials for these treatments, high rates of effectiveness are also expected in real-world clinical practice. Hence, this study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of IFN-free therapies for hepatitis C. Methods: The search was performed in four electronic databases and included cohort studies that evaluated IFN-free schemes and provided data on SVR at 12?weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) as the primary outcome. Overall and subgroup meta-analyses of patients¡¦ clinical conditions (e.g. co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cirrhosis, liver transplant, specific genotypes, and other conditions) were performed.

Background: The optimal methodology of establishing access for peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains controversial. Previously published randomized controlled trials and cohort studies do not demonstrate an advantage for 1 technique over another. Four published meta-analyses comparing outcomes of laparoscopic versus open PD catheter (PDC) insertion have given inconsistent conclusions and are flawed since they group basic and advanced laparoscopy together. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine whether advanced laparoscopic interventions consisting of rectus sheath tunneling and adjunctive procedures produce a better outcome than open insertion or basic laparoscopy used only to verify the catheter position. ? Methods: A literature search using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database was performed, and meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3.5 software (Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Outcomes evaluated incidence of catheter obstruction, migration, pericannular leak, hernia, infectious complications (peritonitis and exit-site infection) and catheter survival. ? Results: Of the 467 records identified, 7 cohort studies, including 1,045 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. When advanced laparoscopy was compared with open insertion, a significant reduction was observed in the incidence of catheter obstruction (odds ratio [OR] 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 ¡V 0.63; p = 0.01), catheter migration (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.06 ¡V 0.26; p = 0.00001), pericannular leak (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11 ¡V 0.64; p = 0.003), and pericannular and incisional hernias (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.09 ¡V 0.94; p = 0.04), as well as better 1-and 2-year catheter survival (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28 ¡V 0.97; p = 0.04 and OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 ¡V 0.92; p = 0.03, respectively). Compared with basic laparoscopy, catheter obstruction and migration were significantly lower in the advanced laparoscopic group, whereas catheter survival was similar in both groups. All outcomes, except catheter obstruction, were similar between the basic laparoscopy and open insertion.

Evidence on the collective impact of smoking in aesthetic procedure outcomes is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current evidence on the association between smoking and postoperative outcomes in patients who underwent common elective procedures in plastic surgery. Methods: PubMed and Cochrane bibliographical databases were searched from January 1950 to October 2016 for studies reporting on patients who underwent facelift, abdominoplasty, breast reduction and breast reconstruction and for studies with included data on smoking history of treated patients. Results: Fifty-three studies reporting on postoperative complications in tobacco users undergoing facelift, abdominoplasty, breast reduction and reconstruction were identified. Tobacco use is found to significantly increase the total number of postoperative complications as far as abdominoplasty (OR: 5.43; 95% CI = 2.92¡V10.10), breast reduction (OR: 2.36; 95% CI = 1.64¡V3.39) and breast reconstruction (OR: 1.91; 95% CI = 1.69¡V2.17) are concerned. Smoking history does not significantly affect total postoperative complications after facelift procedures (OR: 3.36; 95% CI = 0.92¡V12.30). Conclusions: Smoking predisposes to surgical site infections, delayed wound healing and skin necrosis in patients undergoing the most common aesthetic procedures in plastic surgery.

With the aim of providing insight important for the development of patient quality care improvement initiatives, the primary objective of this review was to evaluate the available literature systematically in order to determine the contemporary rates of reoperation, readmission, and ED visits following thyroid operations. A secondary study objective was to determine if there were any practices that showed promise in reducing the occurrence of these undesirable postoperative events. Methods: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols. Twenty-two studies were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain the weighted-pooled summary estimates of rates of reoperations, ED visits, and unplanned hospital readmission. Jackknife sensitivity analyses were performed for each data set. Finally, in order to detect the risk of publication bias and the small-study effect, funnel plot analysis was performed. Results: The pooled rate estimate for reoperation was very low (0.6% [confidence interval (CI) 0.3-1.1%]). This was subject to publication bias because smaller studies tended to report lower rates of reoperation. The pooled rate of ED visits was 8.1% [CI 6.5-9.8%], while the pooled rate of hospital readmission from 19 studies was 2.7% [CI 2.1-3.4%]. Neck hematoma was the most common reason for reoperation, while postoperative hypocalcemia was the most common reason for hospital readmission. Conclusions: ED visits and hospital readmission after thyroidectomy are common, and there are several practices that can reduce their occurrence. Routine postoperative calcium and Vitamin D supplementation may reduce rates of postoperative hypocalcemia, and avoiding postoperative hypertension may decrease the risk of neck hematoma development and the need for reoperation. Older age, thyroid cancer, dependent functional status, higher ASA score, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid use, hemodialysis, and recent weight loss increase the risk of hospital readmission after thyroid surgery. By further identifying risk factors for reoperation, ED visits, and readmission, this review may assist practitioners in optimizing perioperative care and therefore reducing patient morbidity and mortality after thyroid operations. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate differences in outcome variables between these two operative methods. Materials and methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and CNKI were searched with the terms ¡§thoracolumbar fractures¡¨, ¡§posterior¡¨, ¡§pedicle screw fixation¡¨, and ¡§clinical trial¡¨ from Jan 1980 to July 2017. Two reviewers independently screened the studies for eligibility, evaluated the quality and extracted data from eligible studies, with confirmation by cross-checking. The major results and conclusions were concluded, and the different complication rates and functional outcomes were compared. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Eighteen randomized controlled trials involving 1280 patients were eligible. The pooled data revealed that AFV group might be associated with more intraoperative blood loss (MD = 9.84, 95%CI 7.45 to 12.22) and longer operation time (MD = 1.97, 95%CI 0.17 to 3.77) when compared with CFV group. However, AFV group significantly improved visual analogue scale (VAS) (MD = ?1.27, 95%CI -1.70 to ?0.83), anterior vertebral height (AVH) (MD = 7.58, 95%CI 3.99 to 11.17), short-term Cobb angle (MD = ?1.29, 95%CI -2.39 to ?0.19), long-term Cobb angle (MD = ?4.47, 95%CI -7.30 to ?1.63) and loss of long-term correction efficacy (MD = ?6.56, 95%CI -7.49 to ?5.62) after surgery. Moreover, compared with the CFV group, the AFV group had lower rate of implant failure (MD = 0.16, 95%CI 0.07 to 0.36). Both techniques had similar hospital stay (MD = 0.25, 95%CI -0.52 to 1.03) and postoperative infection (MD = 0.53, 95%CI 0.13 to 2.23). Conclusions: Though with a more operation time and intraoperative hemorrhage, combined pedicle screw fixation at the fracture veterbrae may be better than traditional fixation cross the fracture level alone for thoracolumbar fractures. ? 2018"

The overall pooled MTC for oral HIV PrEP was 59.9% (95% CI 43.1% to 74.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the MTC level of participants aged <30 years was lower than those equal or older than 30 years (34.9% vs 69.6%, p<0.001); those studies that enrolled only women as participants had lower MTC than those only recruiting either only men or both men and women (31.3% vs 71.7% and 31.3% vs 71.0%, all p<0.01). Additionally, the HIV infection risk increased as the MTC level declines, with the incidence RRs being 0.28 (95% CI 0.19 to 0.41), 0.42 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.62) and 0.75 (95% CI 0.45 to 1.25) in the good (?80%), moderate (60%~80%) and poor (<60%) MTC subgroups, respectively (linear trend test p<0.01).CONCLUSION: According to the pooled proportion, the MTC of oral HIV PrEP is almost moderate, and its proportion in women and younger participants was relatively low. The protective efficacy of oral PrEP for HIV prevention increased with MTC level. These findings indicated that it is necessary to identify measures to enhance MTC of oral PrEP in future clinical usage, especially in women and younger participants with high HIV infection risk. ?

The role of hepatitis C virus infection as a risk factor for the development and progression of chronic kidney disease in the general population remains unclear. Material and methods. A systematic review of the published medical literature was performed to assess whether positive anti-HCV serologic status is associated with higher frequency of chronic kidney disease in the adult general population. We used a random-effects model to generate a summary estimate of the relative risk of chronic kidney disease (defined by lowered glomerular filtration rate or detectable proteinuria) with HCV across the published studies. Meta-regression and stratified analysis were also carried out. Results. Forty studies were eligible (n = 4,072,867 patients), and separate meta-analyses were conducted according to the outcome. Pooling results of longitudinal studies (n = 15 studies, n = 2,299,134 unique patients) demonstrated an association between positive anti-HCV serologic status and increased incidence of CKD, the summary estimate for adjusted HR with HCV across the surveys, 1.54 (95% CI, 1.26; 1.87) (P &lt; 0.001).

However, their safety profile in pregnant women is controversial. The association between fluoroquinolones and arthropathy was primarily described in immature animals, and only rarely in humans, yet it has led to the restricted use of quinolones during pregnancy. We aimed to assess their safety during pregnancy. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the safety of quinolone exposure during any time of pregnancy, and during first trimester alone, was performed. The systematic review was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE, and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Pooled effect sizes with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects models, comparing fetal outcomes of quinolone exposed and non-exposed pregnancies. Only cohort and case control studies were included in the meta-analysis. Result: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Exposure to quinolones during first trimester was not associated with an increased risk for birth defects (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.89, 95% CI 0.72¡V1.09, I2?= 0%), stillbirth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.33¡V5.34, I2?= 16%), preterm birth (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.83¡V1.48, I2?= 41%) and low birth weight (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 0.54¡V3.12, I2?= 67%).

Although immediate start of antibiotics reduces sepsis-related mortality, antibiotics are often administered for too long, leading to suboptimal treatment and, importantly, contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Prior literature suggests that procalcitonin correlates with infection and thus may help to guide the decision on when to stop antibiotic treatment. This study was conducted as part of a regulatory submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and aimed to summarize the evidence of procalcitonin guidance on efficacy and safety outcomes in adult patients with sepsis. Data Sources: PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Study Selection: English-language randomized controlled trials evaluating procalcitonin use among adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis published between January 2004 and May 2016. Data Extraction: Inverse-variance weighting fixed and random effects meta-analyses were performed on the following efficacy and safety endpoints: antibiotic duration, all-cause mortality, and length of ICU stay. Two reviewers independently extracted data elements from identified studies and measured risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data Synthesis: From a total of 369 potentially eligible articles, 10 randomized controlled trials containing 3,489 patients were used for analysis. Procalcitonin-guided patients had shorter antibiotics duration compared with controls (7.35 vs. 8.85 d; weighted mean difference, -1.49 d; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.71; p < 0.001). Procalcitonin use had no adverse impact on mortality (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.03; p = 0.114) and length of ICU stay (11.09 d vs. 11.91 d; weighted mean difference, -0.84 d; 95% CI, -2.52 to 0.84; p = 0.329).

Methods: Using PRISMA guidelines a database search was conducted from inception up until 1 May 2017 for peer-reviewed studies on structural or functional neuroimaging assessment of chronic hepatitis C patients without cirrhosis or encephalopathy, with control group. Meta-analyses were performed when possible. Results: The final sample comprised 25 studies (magnetic resonance spectroscopy [N?=?12], perfusion weighted imaging [N?=?1], positron emission tomography [N?=?3], single-photon emission computed tomography [N?=?4], functional connectivity in resting state [N?=?1], diffusion tensor imaging [N?=?2] and structural magnetic resonance imaging [N?=?2]).

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the optimal mode of fixation (full-cementless vs. full-cemented) in TKA. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases up to July 2017 were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing full-cementless TKA and full-cemented TKA. The primary outcome was implant survivorship. Secondary outcomes included radiological outcomes (maximum total point-motion [MTPM], radiolucent line, rotation degree) and clinical outcomes (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC] score, Knee Society Score [KSS] score, postoperative range of movement, blood loss and complications). Results: Seven studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The mean follow-up was 7.1 years (range from 2 to 16.6 years).

Blood pressure support with a noncatecholamine vasopressor may reduce stimulation of adrenergic receptors and decreasemyocardial oxygen demand. Atrial fibrillation is common with catecholamines and is associated with adverse events, including mortality and increased length of stay (LOS). OBJECTIVES To determine whether treatment with vasopressin + catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamine vasopressors alone was associated with reductions in the risk of adverse events. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to February 2018. Experts were asked and meta-registries searched to identify ongoing trials. STUDY SELECTION Pairs of reviewers identified randomized clinical trials comparing vasopressin in combination with catecholamine vasopressors to catecholamines alone for patients with distributive shock. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers abstracted data independently. A random-effects model was used to combine data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas atrial fibrillation. Other outcomes included mortality, requirement for renal replacement therapy (RRT),myocardial injury, ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and LOS in the intensive care unit and hospital. Measures of association are reported as risk ratios (RRs) for clinical outcomes and mean differences for LOS. RESULTS Twenty-Three randomized clinical trials were identified (3088 patients; mean age, 61.1 years [14.2]; women, 45.3%). High-quality evidence supported a lower risk of atrial fibrillation associated with vasopressin treatment (RR, 0.77 [95%CI, 0.67 to 0.88]; risk difference [RD], -0.06 [95%CI, -0.13 to 0.01]). For mortality, the overall RR estimate was 0.89 (95%CI, 0.82 to 0.97; RD, -0.04 [95%CI, -0.07 to 0.00]); however, when limited to trials at low risk of bias, the RR estimate was 0.96 (95%CI, 0.84 to 1.11). The overall RR estimate for RRT was 0.74 (95%CI, 0.51 to 1.08; RD, -0.07 [95%CI, -0.12 to -0.01]). However, in an analysis limited to trials at low risk of bias, RR was 0.70 (95%CI, 0.53 to 0.92, P for interaction = .77). There were no significant differences in the pooled risks for other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review and meta-Analysis, the addition of vasopressin to catecholamine vasopressors compared with catecholamines alone was associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation.

To counter the problem, a national strategic plan was developed and adopted in July 2017 to coordinate viral hepatitis elimination's efforts. However evidence to support its implementation remains scanty and scattered. The main purpose of this study was to summarize available information from per-reviewed articles published over the last two decades to accurately estimate the prevalence of HBV infection in Burkina Faso. Methods: We conducted a systematic search with meta-analysis of scientific articles using Science-Direct, Web-of-Science, PubMed/Medline, and Google Scholar. We systematically assessed all relevant publications that measured the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen and which were published between 1996 and 2017. We estimated the national HBV prevalence and its 95% confident interval. We subsequently adjusted the meta-analysis to possible sources of heterogeneity. Results: We retrieved and analyzed a total of 22 full text papers including 99,672 participants. The overall prevalence was 11.21%. The prevalence after adjustment were 9.41%, 11.11%, 11.73% and 12.61% in the general population, pregnant women, blood donors and HIV-positive persons respectively. The prevalence was higher before implementation of HBV universal vaccination and decreased from 12.80% between 1996 and 2001 to 11.11% between 2012 and 2017. The prevalence was also higher in rural area 17.35% than urban area 11.11%. The western regions were more affected with 12.69% than the central regions 10.57%. The prevalence was 14.66% in the boucle of Mouhoun region and 14.59 in the center-west region. Aggregate data were not available for the other regions. Conclusions: HBV has clearly an important burden in Burkina Faso as described by its high prevalence and this problem significantly challenges the national health care system. There is an urgent need for effective public health interventions to eliminate the problem. However, higher quality data are needed to produce reliable epidemiological estimates that will guide control efforts towards the achievement of the national strategic plan's goals. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Brucellosis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and it may last several days or even several years; however, it is often misdiagnosed and therefore may cause inadequate therapy and prolonged illness. Previous studies about meta-analysis of manifestations of brucellosis reported in English lacked the data published in Chinese, which did not provide details about the contact history, laboratory tests, and misdiagnosis. We undertake a meta-analysis of clinical manifestations of human brucellosis in China to identify those gaps in the literature. We have searched published articles in electronic databases up to December 2016 identified as relating to clinical features of human brucellosis in China. 68 studies were included in the analysis. The main clinical manifestations were fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and muscle pain (87%, 63%, 62%, and 56%, resp.). There are significant differences between adults and children. Rash, respiratory and cardiac complications, and orchitis/epididymitis were more prevalent in children patients. The common complications of brucellosis were hepatitis, followed by osteoarthritis, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system dysfunction, hemophagocytic syndrome, and orchitis/epididymitis in male. In the nonpastoral areas, brucellosis has a high ratio of misdiagnosis. Our analysis provides further evidence for the accurate diagnosis, particularly in assessing severe, debilitating sequelae of this infection. ? 2018 Rongjiong Zheng et al."

However, the information on this issue is scarce. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the incidence of culture-positive PF and its impact on solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Seventeen studies were identified and included. The overall incidence of culture-positive PF was 37% (95% CI: 27% to 49%), and the incidence of PF-related infections among SOT recipients with PF cultures that grew pathogenic microorganisms was 10% (95% CI: 7% to 15%). There were differences in the rates of infections due to pathogenic microorganisms between SOT recipients who received pre-emptive treatment and those who did not, but without statistical significance. The mortality rate among SOT recipients with PF-related infection was 35% (95% CI: 21% to 53%). In conclusion, although contamination of the PF of donated organs is frequent, the incidence of PF-related infection is relatively low. A closely clinical and microbiologic monitoring of the SOT recipient in case of culture-positive PF, regardless of the type of microorganism isolated might be do in order to establish a prompt diagnosis of PF-related infection. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Some evidence has shown the role of this infection with CT in spontaneous abortions. The purpose of this study is to study the frequency of CT infection in Iranian women. Methods: This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines. A total of 75 articles published in Google Scholar, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Biological abs, Iranmedex, SID, and Scopus databases were found (1986-2015) using the following keywords: CT in women, CT and Iranian women, CT and infection in Iran, CT and pregnancy in Iran, CT and preterm delivery in Iran, CT and preterm labor in Iran, CT and fertility in Iran, CT and infertility in Iran, and CT and abortion in Iran. Finally, 40 studies from different regions of Iran were included. Statistical analyses were performed using R3 and STATA 12. Results: From 1986 to 2015, the lowest rate of prevalence was from 2010 to 2011 (3.9%) and the highest prevalence rate was in 2009 (69.39%) in northern Iran.

Conclusion: CT infection in this study was prevalent in urine samples and the rate of CT was observed from culture methods in comparison to other methods. Because women with CT play an important role because of sexual activity for transmission and untreated women are at risk of developing sequels. Also, most studies in Iran use sensitive polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of genital CT infections.

Aim: To establish the reported regional and national prevalence of H. pylori infection, stratified by age and gender. Methods: All relevant English publications from 2000 to 2017 cited by PubMed and Scopus were retrieved using comprehensive combinations of keywords. The overall prevalence of H. pylori was estimated using both random effect and fixed effect meta-analyses, and presented as prevalence rate (% and 95% CI). The analyses were extended by separation into gender and age groups. Results: A total of 14?056 records were obtained initially. After applying exclusion criteria in several steps, 183 studies were selected. Analysis of 410?879 participants from 73 countries in six continents revealed an overall prevalence of 44.3% (95% CI: 40.9-47.7) worldwide. This rate ranged from 50.8% (95% CI: 46.8-54.7) in developing countries compared with 34.7% (95% CI: 30.2-39.3) in developed countries. The global H. pylori infection rate was 42.7% (95% CI: 39-46.5) in females compared to 46.3% (95% CI: 42.1-50.5) in males. The prevalence in adults (?18?years) was significantly higher than in children (48.6% [95% CI: 43.8-53.5] vs 32.6% [95% CI: 28.4-36.8], respectively). There was a statistically nonsignificant decrease in the prevalence in 2009-2016 compared with the 2000-2009 period. Conclusions: The observed differences between countries appear to be due to economic and social conditions. H. pylori infection can be a benchmark for the socioeconomic and health status of a country. Further studies are suggested to investigate the natural history of the acquisition of H. pylori infection from childhood into adult life. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent pharmacodynamics; therefore, it is postulated that continuous infusion (CI) may optimize these parameters. Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature comparing CI versus intermittent bolus (IB) of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill adult patients with respiratory infections to determine if clinical benefits exist. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched. Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analyses of clinical cure and/or mortality. Four retrospective studies reporting clinical cure and/or mortality, and 11 studies that reported pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were included in the systematic review. Results: The majority of patients in both groups maintained the percentage of time the free drug concentration exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (%fT?>?MIC) targets throughout the treatment, with differences favoring CI being more prevalent when the MIC of the offending pathogen increased. CI of beta-lactam antibiotics in critically ill adult patients with respiratory infections significantly improved clinical cure rates when compared to IB (risk ratio [RR] 1.177; 95% CI 1.065¡V1.300). No significant differences in mortality rates were seen when patients were treated with either dosing modality (RR 0.845; 95% CI 0.644¡V1.108).

We pursued a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of six selected infectious diseases (i.e., syphilis, helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, intestinal protozoa infections, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C) among migrants/refugees of African origin. Three electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Science) were searched without language restrictions. Relevant data were extracted and random-effects meta-analyses conducted. Only adjusted estimates were analyzed to help account for heterogeneity and potential confounding. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. The results were stratified by geographical region. Ninety-six studies were included. The evidence was of low quality due to the small numbers of countries, infectious diseases, and participants included. African migrants/refugees had median (with 95% confidence interval [95% CI]) prevalence for syphilis, helminthiasis, schistosomiasis, intestinal protozoa infection, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C of 6.0% [95% CI: 2.0¡V7.0%], 13.0% [95% CI: 9.5¡V14.5%], 14.0% [95% CI: 13.0¡V17.0%], 15.0% [95% CI: 10.5¡V21.0%], 10.0% [95% CI: 6.0¡V14.0%], and 3.0% [95% CI: 1.0¡V4.0%], respectively. We found high heterogeneity regardless of the disease (I2; minimum 97.5%, maximum 99.7%). The relatively high prevalence of some infectious diseases among African migrants/refugees warrants for systematic screening. The large heterogeneity of the available published data does not allow for stratifying such screening programs according to the geographical origin of African migrants/refugees. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."

MDRO rates were independently associated with mortality rates in the studies, adjusting to the rate of IEAT. The prevalence of MDROs, mainly multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, is significantly associated with the probability of prescribing IEAT and mortality rates in recent studies.

Recently, synovial fluid leukocyte esterase (LE), measurement of which is convenient and fast, has been examined as a marker of PJI. We summarized the articles describing synovial fluid LE as a biomarker for the diagnosis of PJI and assessed its diagnostic value in patients suspected of having PJI. Methods: We searched with appropriate key words in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane database, and Science Direct. Eligible studies providing sufficient data to construct 2 ¡Ñ 2 contingency tables were chosen on the basis of several criteria, and the quality of the chosen studies was assessed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated for those studies. The summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the area under the SROC (AUSROC) were used to evaluate the overall diagnostic performance of LE. Results: Eleven studies were found suitable for this systematic review. Among them, eight articles with a total of 1,011 participants qualified for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR were 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76-0.96), 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.98), and 310.76 (95% CI 103.86-929.88), respectively.

Publication bias was suggested by an asymmetrical funnel plot (p = 0.144). Conclusion: Although the result of synovial fluid LE assay can be influenced by sample-related factors, it is more specific as a means to exclude PJI. ? Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes from intramedullary nailing and external fixation in patients with infected TKA undergoing arthrodesis procedures was performed. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were included. Results: Intramedullary nailing achieves a significantly higher rate of radiographic union compared with external fixation (odds ratio [OR] 5.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.74-9.75, P <.00001) at a mean follow-up of 44.22 months.

Results: A total of 1750 infants were pooled to estimate the overall prevalence of UTI in infants with prolonged jaundice. The prevalence reported by the studies included in this literature review was extremely variable and ranged 0.6¡V53.9%. The overall prevalence was 11% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 5.0¡V18.0), and Escherichia coli was found to be the main cause of UTI. Conclusion: The overall prevalence of UTI was 11%, and E. coli was the main cause of UTI in infants with prolonged jaundice. Screening of UTI should be considered for infants with prolonged jaundice. ? 2018 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company"

Several new MRSA-active antibiotics have been developed, including semisynthetic glycopeptides (telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin). Of these, dalbavancin and oritavancin offer extended dosing intervals. Methods: We performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost analysis to compare the newer glycopeptides to standard care and to each other for the treatment of complicated SSTIs (cSSTI). A search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We also developed a model to evaluate the costs associated with dalbavancin and oritavancin from the third-party payer perspective. Results: Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Network meta-analyses suggested that the clinical response to telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin was similar to standard care (odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90¡V1.33; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.52¡V1.18; and OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85¡V1.33, respectively). Head-to-head comparisons showed no difference in clinical response between oritavancin and dalbavancin (OR 1.36; 95% CI 0.85¡V2.18), oritavancin and telavancin (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.72¡V1.31) or dalbavancin and telavancin (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.45¡V1.13). Telavancin had a higher incidence of overall adverse events compared to standard care (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10¡V1.61). Compared to telavancin, there were fewer overall adverse events with dalbavancin (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.45¡V0.76) and oritavancin (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.55¡V0.92). Studies were of high quality overall. Our cost analyses demonstrated that dalbavancin and oritavancin were less costly compared to standard care under baseline assumptions and many scenarios evaluated. The use of dalbavancin could save third-party payers $1442 to $4803 per cSSTI, while the use of oritavancin could save $3571 to $6932 per cSSTI. Conclusions: Dalbavancin and oritavancin demonstrate efficacy and safety comparable to standard care in well-designed RCTs and result in cost savings when standard care is treatment that covers MRSA. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

We performed a systematic review, including recently published randomized trials, to determine if storage age of RBCs is associated with mortality, morbidity or adverse events in patients. Searches were performed up to 21st July 2017 in Medline (OvidSP), 20 July in EMBASE (OvidSP) and June 2017 in Cochrane Library. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials comparing transfusion of fresher or freshest available with older or standard issue RBCs. Human volunteer and autologous RBC transfusion studies were excluded. Data were extracted from published reports independently by 2 authors and strength of evidence assessed according to GRADE criteria. The primary outcome was latest-reported mortality. Sixteen trials randomizing 31,359 patients were identified. Transfusion with fresher compared with older RBC was not associated with risk of death (relative risk [RR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.98-1.09; P =.20, I2 = 0%, high quality evidence), but was associated with higher risk of transfusion reactions (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.76; P =.02; I2 = 0%; high quality evidence) and infection (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17; P =.05; I2 = 0%, moderate evidence). Trial sequential analysis showed required information size has now been reached to exclude a 10% relative risk increase or decrease in mortality.

Because the resistance rate of H.?pylori to furazolidone is low, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of furazolidone. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases and included randomized controlled trials (RCT) that either compared furazolidone to other antibiotics or changed the administered dose of furazolidone. A total of 18 articles were included in the meta-analysis. According to the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the total eradication rates of furazolidone-containing therapy were superior to those of other antibiotic-containing therapies (relative risk [RR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.14) (13 RCTs). Specifically, the eradication rates of furazolidone-containing therapy were better than those for metronidazole-containing therapy (RR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21 for ITT). The eradication rate of furazolidone-containing bismuth-containing quadruple therapy was 92.9% (95% CI: 90.7%-95.1%) (PP). In addition, a higher daily dose of furazolidone increased the eradication rate (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.05-1.31). And the incidence of some adverse effects, such as fever and anorexia, was higher in the furazolidone group than in the control group, the overall incidences of total side effects and severe side effects showed no significant differences between the groups. Furazolidone-containing treatments could achieve satisfactory eradication rates and did not increase the incidence of total or severe adverse effects, but the incidence of milder side effects, such as fever and anorexia, should be considered when prescribing furazolidone-containing treatments to patients. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Dexamethasone effectively prevents postoperative nausea and vomiting after general anaesthesia, but its value in patients receiving long-acting neuraxial opioids is undetermined. Therefore, the objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the prophylactic anti-emetic efficacy of intravenous (i.v.) dexamethasone in this population. The study methodology followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcome was the need for rescue anti-emetics during the first 24 postoperative hours, analysed according to the dose of dexamethasone (low-dose 2.5¡V5.0 mg; intermediate dose 6.0¡V10.0 mg), timing of administration (beginning or end of surgery) and route of long-acting opioid administration (intrathecal or epidural). Additionally, the rates of complications (restlessness, infection, hyperglycaemia) were sought. Thirteen trials were identified, representing a total of 1111 patients. When compared with placebo, intravenous dexamethasone reduced the need for rescue anti-emetics (risk ratio (95%CI) 0.44 (0.35¡V0.56); I2 = 43%; p &lt; 0.00001; quality of GRADE evidence: moderate), without differences between dexamethasone doses (p for sub-group difference = 0.67), timing of administration (p for sub-group difference = 0.32) or route of long-acting opioid (p for sub-group difference = 0.10). No patients developed infection or restlessness among trials that sought these complications. No trial measured blood glucose levels.

Imprisonment is an important risk factor for contracting TB, especially among those living with HIV. This systematic review summarizes the available data on the prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; which may support improved targeted TB/HIV prevention plans. We electronically examined published studies up to December 2017 with the aim of finding articles that investigated the prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners. MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Embase, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched with no restriction on language or time. A random effects model was used to conduct the meta-analysis and generate a summary estimate for the global prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners; and subgroup estimates by continent. The meta-analysis included 22 studies published from 1992 to 2016. In total, 2,465 articles were retrieved and 22 papers met inclusion criteria. Eligible papers contained 220,101 prisoners, with 1,611 cases of TB in 6,126 HIV-positive subjects. Globally, the pooled prevalence of TB in HIV-positive prisoners was 32.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 27.5% to 38.2%; p-value for heterogeneity = 0.001]. Results of the subgroup analysis by continent were as follows: Africa, 14% (CI: 8% to 24%); North/South America, 37% (CI: 31% to 44%); Asia, 35% (CI: 12% to 68%); and Europe, 25% (CI: 12% to 45%). Conclusions: The prevalence of TB among HIV-positive prisoners is high worldwide. Screening of TB in this population is essential for the treatment of both diseases. Syndemics of TB and HIV in prisoners during the past three decades have created an alarming situation across the world. Hence, coordinated policies are essential for the early identification and effective treatment of this vulnerable population. ? 2018, Publicaciones Permanyer. All rights reserved."

The goal of this review was to compare outcomes with purse-string closure technique (PSC) versus conventional closure technique (CCT) for skin closure after stoma reversal. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare SSI rate within 30 days, operative time, hospital stay, incisional hernia and intestinal obstruction rates between PSC and CCT. Results: The pooled analysis of 5 studies showed a statically significant lower rate of SSI in favor of PSC compared to CCT (OR -0.24; 95% CI -0.32, - 0.15; p < 0.00001).

Interbody fusion is considered the ¡§gold standard¡¨ in the treatment of lumbar degenerative diseases. Both PLIF and TLIF have been advocated, and it remains controversial as to the best operative technique. Methods: The electronic databases including Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane library were searched to identify relevant studies up to September 2017. The primary outcomes were fusion rate, complications, and clinical satisfaction. The secondary outcomes were length of hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, postoperative visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. Results: A total of 16 studies involving 1502 patients (805 patients in PLIF group and 697 in TLIF group) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that there was no significant difference in terms of fusion rate (P > 0.05) and clinical satisfaction (P > 0.05) between the 2 groups. TLIF was superior to PLIF with significantly lower incidence of nerve root injury (P < 0.05) and dural tear (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference regarding wound infection (P > 0.05) and graft malposition (P > 0.05). PLIF required significant longer operation time (P < 0.05) and was associated with more blood loss (P < 0.05). Although TLIF was associated with better postoperative visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Japanese Orthopaedic Association Score than PLIF, there was no statistical difference regarding these results. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that both TLIF and PLIF could achieve similar clinical satisfaction and fusion rate in the management of degenerative lumbar diseases. However, TLIF was superior to PLIF with shorter operation time, less blood loss, and lower incidence of nerve root injury and dural tear. There is no significant difference between both groups regarding wound infection and graft malposition. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc."

A direct pathogenic link has, however, remained elusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyze the magnitude of H1N1 vaccination related risk and to examine if there was any association with H1N1 infection itself. We searched all articles from PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus, and other relevant sources reporting the incidence and risk of post-vaccine narcolepsy. In our paper, we show that the risk appears to be limited to only one vaccine (Pandemrix?). During the first year after vaccination, the relative risk of narcolepsy was increased 5 to 14-fold in children and adolescents and 2 to 7-fold in adults. The vaccine attributable risk in children and adolescents was around 1 per 18,400 vaccine doses. Studies from Finland and Sweden also appear to demonstrate an extended risk of narcolepsy into the second year following vaccination, but such conclusions should be interpreted with a word of caution due to possible biases.

Our results showed that there were no significant differences between the patients with T2DM receiving 10 empagliflozin and those receiving 25 mg empagliflozin in terms of drug-related adverse effects (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93¡V1.21; P = 0.40, I2 = 0%), adverse events leading to drug discontinuation (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86¡V1.14; P = 0.87, I2 = 0%), and serious adverse events (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95¡V1.18; P = 0.31, I2 = 0%) when empagliflozin was provided as monotherapy or as an add-on to other anti-diabetic medications. The same results were obtained when empagliflozin was used as an add-on to metformin or as monotherapy. The duration of the follow-up periods did not affect the results. However, the incidence of genital and urinary tract infections (UTIs) was significantly higher in female patients than in male patients with 10 or 25?mg empagliflozin. Conclusions: The incidence of ADEs was not significantly different in T2DM patients receiving 10 versus 25?mg empagliflozin as monotherapy or as add-on to metformin or other anti-diabetic drugs during a shorter or longer follow-up period. However, genital and UTIs were more common in female patients with T2DM irrespective of empagliflozin dosage. ? 2018, The Author(s)."

A systematic search through electronic databases identified 547 relevant studies that were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Parents of children with a chronic condition showed small to moderate elevations of general parenting stress and stress related to the parent¡Vchild relationship in particular. They showed moderate to large elevations in health-related parenting stress. Parents of children with cancer, cerebral palsy, HIV infection or AIDS, and spina bifida showed the highest levels of parenting stress. Stress levels also varied by illness severity and duration, child age, parental gender and mental health, marital status, marital quality, and levels of perceived support. Behaviour problems of the child and low parental mental health were the strongest correlates of parenting stress. The present results assist with identifying parents at highest needs for interventions aimed at reducing parenting stress. These interventions should address the reduction of child behaviour problems, the promotion of parental mental health, the increase in marital quality and social support in general, and skills for dealing with stressors.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42016036246) to determine the global and regional prevalence of CKD in HIV patients. Methods We searched PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO and AJOL for articles published between January 1982 and May 2016. CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min using the MDRD, Cockcroft-Gault or CKD-EPI equations. Random effects model was used to combine prevalence estimates from across studies after variance stabilization via Freeman¡VTukey transformation. Result Sixty-one eligible articles (n = 209,078 HIV patients) in 60 countries were selected. The overall CKD prevalence was 6.4% (95%CI 5.2¡V7.7%) with MDRD, 4.8% (95%CI 2.9¡V7.1%) with CKD-EPI and 12.3% (95%CI 8.4¡V16.7%) with Cockcroft¡VGault; p = 0.003 for difference across estimators. Sub-group analysis identified differences in prevalence by WHO region with Africa having the highest MDRD-based prevalence at 7.9% (95%CI 5.2¡V11.1%). Within Africa, the pooled MDRD-based prevalence was highest in West Africa [14.6% (95%CI 9.9¡V20.0%)] and lowest in Southern Africa (3.2%, 95%CI 3.0¡V3.4%). The heterogeneity observed could be explained by WHO region, comorbid hypertension and diabetes mellitus, but not by gender, hepatitis B or C coinfection, CD4 count or antiretroviral status. Conclusion CKD is common in HIV-infected people, particularly in Africa. HIV treatment programs need to intensify screening for CKD with added need to introduce global guidelines for CKD identification and treatment in HIV positive patients. ? 2018 Ekrikpo et al.

This is particularly challenging with valvular surgery, given the lower volume and increased complexity of these procedures. The present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of trainee operator status on clinical outcomes following valvular surgery. Methods: Medline, Embase and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched for studies reporting clinical outcomes according to the training status of the primary operator (consultant or trainee). Data were extracted and meta-analysed according to pre-defined endpoints. Results: Eleven observational studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on five patient cohorts undergoing mitral valve surgery (n = 3975), six undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) (n = 6236) and three undergoing combined AVR and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 3495). Perioperative mortality was not significantly different between trainee and consultant cases for mitral valve surgery (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62¡V1.37), AVR (OR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.37¡V1.24), or combined AVR and CABG (OR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.40¡V2.85). The incidences of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, acute renal failure, reoperation or wound infection were not significantly different between trainee and consultant cases. There was a paucity of mid-term survival data. Conclusions: Valvular surgery cases performed primarily by trainees were not associated with adverse perioperative outcomes. These findings suggest the rigorous design of cardiac surgical trainee programs can sufficiently mitigate trainee deficiencies. However, studies with longer follow-up duration and echocardiographic data are required to assess long-term durability and safety. ? 2017 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)"

The objective of these meta-analyses was to compare the safeties of antistaphylococcal penicillins and cefazolin. The PubMed, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts databases and websites for clinical trial registries through 23 June 2017 were searched. In addition, recent abstracts from infectious disease and pharmacy conferences were reviewed. We estimated Peto odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using random-effects models. One analysis focused on hospitalized patients, and the other focused on outpatients. Eleven retrospective studies of hospitalized patients and three retrospective studies of outpatients were included. In hospitalized patients, lower rates of nephrotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.225; 95% CI, 0.127 to 0.513), acute interstitial nephritis (Peto OR, 0.189; 95% CI, 0.053 to 0.675), hepatotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.160; 95% CI, 0.066 to 0.387), and drug discontinuation due to adverse reactions (Peto OR, 0.192; 95% CI, 0.089 to 0.414) were found with cefazolin. In outpatients, lower rates of nephrotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.372; 95% CI, 0.192 to 0.722), hepatotoxicity (Peto OR, 0.313; 95% CI, 0.156 to 0.627), and hypersensitivity reactions (Peto OR, 0.372; 95% CI, 0.201 to 0.687) were observed with cefazolin. Compared to antistaphylococcal penicillins, cefazolin was associated with significant reductions in nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in hospitalized patients and outpatients. Additionally, cefazolin was associated with lower likelihoods of discontinuation due to side effects in hospitalized patients and hypersensitivity reactions in outpatients. Cefazolin should be considered a first-line option for patients with MSSA infections for which efficacy is presumed to be similar to that of antistaphylococcal penicillin therapy.

It cannot be excluded, however, that the lack of fundoplication after POEM may result in a higher incidence of reflux disease, as compared with LHM. The aim of our study was to conduct a systematic review of prospective studies reporting the incidence of reflux disease developed after POEM and LHM. Methods: A literature search with electronic databases was performed (up to February 2017) to identify full articles on the incidence of gastroesophageal reflux symptoms and endoscopic monitoring and pH monitoring findings after POEM and LHM (with fundoplication). Proportions and rates were pooled by means of random or fixed-effects models, according to the level of heterogeneity between studies. Results: After we applied the selection criteria, 17 and 28 studies, including 1542 and 2581 participants who underwent POEM and LHM, respectively, were included. The pooled rate of postprocedural symptoms was 19.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.7%-22.8%) after POEM and 8.8% (95% CI, 5.3%-14.1%) after LHM, respectively. The pooled rate estimate of abnormal acid exposure at pH monitoring was 39.0% (95% CI, 24.5%-55.8%) after POEM and 16.8% (95% CI, 10.2%-26.4%) after LHM, respectively. The rate of esophagitis after POEM was 29.4% (95% CI, 18.5%-43.3%) after POEM and 7.6% (95% CI, 4.1%-13.7%) after LHM. At meta-regression, heterogeneity was explained partly by the POEM approach and study population. Conclusion: The incidence of reflux disease appears to be significantly more frequent after POEM than after LHM with fundoplication. Monitoring pH and ensuring appropriate treatment after POEM should be considered in order to prevent long-term reflux-related adverse events. ? 2018 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy"

Preventing this reaction with steroids may improve outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the impact of prophylactic steroids on clinical outcomes in patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative corticosteroid administration with a control group in adults undergoing CPB. Outcomes of interest included mortality, myocardial infarction, and new onset atrial fibrillation. We assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Fifty-six RCTs published between 1977 and 2015 were included in this meta-analysis. Mortality was not significantly different between groups [3.0% (215/7258 patients) in the steroid group and 3.5% (252/7202 patients) in the placebo group; relative risk (RR), 0.85; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71¡V1.01; P=0.07; I2 = 0%].

Conclusions: After randomising 16 013 patients, steroid administration at the time of cardiac surgery had an unclear impact on mortality, increased the risk of myocardial injury, and the impact on atrial fibrillation should be viewed with caution given that large trials showed no effect. ? 2018 British Journal of Anaesthesia"

A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis,2018,Journal of Arthroplasty,10.1016/j.arth.2017.11.011,,"Background: The choice between anterior approach (AA) and posterior approach (PA) in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) is controversial. Previous reviews have predominantly relied on data from retrospective studies. Methods: This systematic review included prospective studies comparing postoperative outcomes through 90 days of AA vs PA in primary THA. Outcomes were pain severity, narcotic usage, hip function using Harris Hip Score, and complications. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for all outcomes. Efficacy data were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) where values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 were defined as small, medium, large, and very large effect sizes, respectively. Complications were reported as the absolute risk difference (RD) where a positive value implied higher risk with AA and a lower value implied lower risk with AA. Results: A total of 13 prospective comparative studies (7 randomized) with patients treated with AA (n = 524) or PA (n = 520) were included. The AA was associated with lower pain severity (SMD = ?0.37, P <.001), lower narcotic usage (SMD = ?0.36, P =.002), and improved hip function (SMD = 0.31, P =.002) compared to PA. No differences between surgical approaches were observed for dislocation (RD = 0.2%, P =.87), fracture (RD = 0.2%, P =.87), hematoma (RD = 0%, P =.99), infection (RD = 0.2%, P =.85), thromboembolic event (RD = ?0.9%, P =.42), or reoperation (RD = 1.3%, P =.26). Conclusions of this study were unchanged when subjected to sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies comparing postoperative outcomes through 90 days of AA vs PA in primary THA, patients treated with AA reported less pain, consumed fewer narcotics, and reported better hip function. No statistical differences in complication rates were detected between AA and PA. Ultimately, the choice of surgical approach in primary THA should consider preference and experience of the surgeon as well as preference and anatomy of the patient. ? 2017 The Author(s)"

Methods: A systematic search was performed from the electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library by November 2017. Using RevMan5.3 statistical software, the primary outcomes including subject and objective cure rates at 6 to 24 months follow-up were evaluated. Meanwhile, analysis was also performed for comparing the secondary outcomes such as peri- and postoperative complications, operative data, and quality of life. Results: Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 6 retrospective cohort studies involving 1794 patients with SUI were analyzed based on the inclusion criteria. On the basis of our analysis, MiniArc was proven to have a noninferior clinical efficacy compared with transobturator midurethral slings with respect to the objective cure rate (risk ratio [RR] = 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.03, P = .43) and subjective cure rate (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.91-1. 04, P = .38). In addition, pooled analysis showed that MiniArc had significantly lower postoperative pain scores (mean difference [MD] = -1.70, 95% CI -3.17 to -0.23, P = .02) and less postoperative groin pain (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98, P = .04). Moreover, the MiniArc group also had a significantly shorter operation time (MD = -6.12, 95% CI -8.61 to -3.64, P < .001), less blood loss (MD = -16.67, 95% CI -26.29 to -7.05, P < .001), shorter in-patient stay (MD = 1.30, 95% CI -1.74 to -0.86, P < .001), and less urinary retention risk (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.46-2.87, P = .77). However, overall evidence was insufficient to suggest a statistically significant difference in the adverse event profile for MiniArc compared with transobturator slings. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that MiniArc is an effective method treating SUI. When compared with transobturator slings, it not only has a similar high cure rates, but also is associated with shorter operation time, less blood loss, more favorable recovery time, lower postoperative pain scores, less postoperative groin pain, less urinary retention, and absence of a visible wound.

The groups were compared for mortality and morbidity outcomes. A total of 2421 patients were included in this review. Of these, 2232 patients underwent transplantectomy and 189 underwent percutaneous embolization. The mortality rate in the nephrectomy group was 4% [95% confidence interval [CI], 2¡V7%; I2=87%] as compared with 0.1% [95% CI, 0.1¡V0.5%; I2=0%] in the embolization group.

There are several preventive measures that are currently employed, including insecticide-treated nets (ITNs, including long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticidal-treated bed nets), indoor residual spraying (IRS), prophylactic drugs (PD), and untreated nets (UN). However, it is unclear which measure is the most effective for malaria prevention. We therefore undertook a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of different preventive measures on incidence of malaria infection. Methods: A systematic literature review was undertaken across four medical and life sciences databases (PubMed, Cochrane Central, Embase, and Web of Science) from their inception to July 2016 to compare the effectiveness of different preventive measures on malaria incidence. Data from the included studies were analysed for the effectiveness of several measures against no intervention (NI). This was carried out using an automated generalized pairwise modeling (GPM) framework for network meta-analysis to generate mixed treatment effects against a common comparator of no intervention (NI). Results: There were 30 studies that met the inclusion criteria from 1998-2016. The GPM framework led to a final ranking of effectiveness of measures in the following order from best to worst: PD, ITN, IRS and UN, in comparison with NI. However, only ITN (RR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32-0.74) showed precision while other methods [PD (RR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.004-15.43), IRS (RR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.20-1.56) and UN (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.28-1.90)] demonstrating considerable uncertainty associated with their point estimates. Conclusion: Current evidence is strong for the protective effect of ITN interventions in malaria prevention. Even though ITNs were found to be the only preventive measure with statistical support for their effectiveness, the role of other malaria control measures may be important adjuncts in the global drive to eliminate malaria. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

Methods: Relevant studies that evaluated the role of bursectomy for AGC were comprehensively examined to perform a meta-analysis. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The secondary outcomes were the number of harvested lymph nodes (LNs), operation time, operative bleeding, hospital stay, postoperative complication and mortality. Results: A total of seven studies comprising 2633 cases (1176 cases in the bursectomy group and 1457 cases in the non-bursectomy group) were finally included. There was no significant difference in OS (HR 0.95, P=0.647) and DFS (HR 0.99, P=0.936) between the two groups. Even for patients with serosa-penetrating tumours, OS was comparable between the two groups (HR 0.87, P=0.356). The operation time of the bursectomy group was longer (weighted mean difference, WMD 32.76 min, P=0.002). No significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the number of dissected LNs (WMD 5.86, P=0.157), operative bleeding (WMD 66.99 ml, P=0.192) and hospital stay (WMD -0.15 days, P=0.766). The overall postoperative complication (relative risk, RR 1.08, P=0.421) and mortality (RR 0.44, P=0.195) were similar between two groups. Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicated that bursectomy is time-consuming without increasing the number of harvested LNs. Although bursectomy can be safely performed without increasing complications and mortality, it does not prolong the OS and DFS of AGC patients, including patients with serosa-penetrating tumours. Therefore, bursectomy should not be recommended as a standard procedure for AGC. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

However, the efficacy is not well reported. Therefore, the objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence on prevention of uncomplicated wound infections by prophylactic topical antibiotics. Materials and methods: The search included Pubmed, Google Scholar, SCOPUS, Embase, Cochrane, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, National Technical Information Service, and the National Guidelines Clearinghouse. Results: We identified eight randomized controlled trials and four quasi-randomized trials that met the criteria for the systematic review. Of these trials, 11 studies were pooled for meta-analysis to compare the effects of topical antibiotics versus placebo and 4 studies were pooled for comparison of effects of topical antibiotics versus topical antiseptics on uncomplicated wounds. Fewer wound infections occurred in the topical antibiotic arms compared to placebo (pooled risk ratio: 0.57 [95% CI: 0.37 to 0.86]; p=0.01 and pooled risk difference: ?3.1% [95% CI: ?5.8% to ?0.34%]; p=0.03). Compared to antiseptics, topical antibiotics demonstrated statistically significant relative risk reduction (pooled risk ratio: 0.56 [95% CI: 0.23 to 0.91]; p=0.02), while there was no significant absolute risk reduction (pooled risk difference: ?3.7% [95% CI: ?7.9% to +0.6%]; p=0.09). Conclusion: Topical antibiotics are effective in reducing wound infections after surgical procedures, but the absolute benefit is small. Given the global emergence of antimicrobial resistance, judicious use of antibiotics is encouraged and use of antiseptics should be considered as a reasonable alternative to topical antibiotics. ? 2018 Tong et al."

The association of statins with primary Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is unclear as studies have reported conflicting findings. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between statin use and CDI. Patients and methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from January 1978 to December 2016 for studies assessing the association between statin use and CDI. The Newcastle¡VOttawa Scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of included studies. Weighted summary estimates were calculated using generalized inverse variance with random-effects model. Results: Eight studies (6 case¡Vcontrol and 2 cohort) were included in the meta-analysis, which comprised 156,722 patients exposed to statins and 356,185 controls, with 34,849 total cases of CDI available in 7 studies. The rate of CDI in patients with statin use was 4.3%, compared with 7.8% in patients without statin use.

Conclusion: Meta-analyses of existing studies suggest that patients prescribed a statin may be at decreased risk for CDI. The results must be interpreted with caution given the significant heterogeneity and lack of benefit on analysis of studies that adjusted for confounders. ? 2018 Tariq et al."

Higher-dose intravenous iron may be associated with a higher risk of infections, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and mortality. This systematic review aimed to determine the safety of higher-dose versus lower-dose intravenous iron, oral iron, or no iron supplementation in adult patients treated with dialysis. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We searched Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and CINAHL from inception to January 6, 2017 for randomized, controlled trials and observational studies comparing higher-dose intravenous iron with lower-dose intravenous iron, oral iron, or no iron in patients treated with dialysis that had all-cause mortality, infection, cardiovascular events, or hospitalizations as outcomes. Results Of the 2231 eligible studies, seven randomized, controlled trials and 15 observational studies met inclusion criteria. The randomized, controlled trials showed no association between higher-dose intravenous iron (>400 mg/mo for most studies) and mortality (six studies; n=970; pooled relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.47 to 1.84; follow-up ranging from 35 days to 26 months) or infection (four studies; n=743; relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.41). The observational studies showed no association between higher-dose intravenous iron (>200 mg/mo for most studies) and mortality (eight studies; n=241,408; hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.98 to 1.21; follow-up ranging from 3 to 24 months), infection (eight studies; n=135,532; pooled hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.28), cardiovascular events (seven studies; n=135,675; hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.56), or hospitalizations (five studies; n=134,324; hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.19). Conclusions Higher-dose intravenous iron does not seem to be associated with higher risk of mortality, infection, cardiovascular events, or hospitalizations in adult patients on dialysis.

The US Food and Drug Administration approved its use in certain types of infections among pediatric patients, and yet there have been mixed data about its efficacy and safety in this population. Objective: The objective of this review is to compare efficacy and all-cause mortality of cefepime to other clinically indicated antibiotics among children. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and clinicaltrials.gov databases through February 8, 2016. We included randomized controlled trials comparing cefepime to other clinical antibiotics, placebo, or no treatment in children aged 0-19 years in the inpatient setting with clinical signs of infection. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were success rate, treatment failure, and incidence of adverse events. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Results: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. There was a total of 1,285 participants included, 624 participants in the cefepime arm and 661 in the comparison arm. A random effects meta-analysis for all-cause mortality showed no difference in rates of mortality between cefepime and comparator antibiotics with a mortality risk ratio of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.71-1.08). For the secondary outcomes of success rate and treatment failure, a random effects model meta-analysis conducted of the studies showed no difference in rate between cefepime and comparator antibiotics with an overall risk ratio of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.05) and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91-1.19), respectively. Adverse events were not statistically assessed given widespread heterogeneity. Overall, the studies had unclear risk of bias and were limited by high heterogeneity and methodological flaws. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of cefepime in pediatric patients remain unclear despite the inclusion of newer trials since the last index systematic review conducted a decade ago. ? 2018 Jan, Ragunanthan, DiBrito, Alabi and Gutierrez."

Methods: Electronic databases were queried for studies comparing FT to FQ-based TRUSPB prophylaxis. Studies were assessed for comparable outcomes and methodological quality (ROBINS-I modification). The primary outcome measure was the relative odds of overall infectious complications following TRUSPB according to FT/FQ treatment, which was evaluated with meta-analysis. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. The relative odds of infections of different severity [Grade 1, bacteriuria and afebrile urinary tract infection (UTI); Grade 2, bacteraemia, febrile UTI, and urosepsis] according to FT/FQ treatment were also estimated. Results: Five studies, being three prospective randomised trials and two retrospective cohort studies, representing 3112 patients, were included.

Accurate and updated data describing the epidemiology of MRSA are crucial for the development of national policies to control MRSA infection in each country. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of MRSA in different parts of Iran. Methods Several databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Scientific Information Database (http://www.sid.ir), were searched from 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2016 to identify studies addressing the frequency or prevalence of MRSA in Iran. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software v.2.2 was used to analyse the data. Results Of the 725 records identified from the databases, 31 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The analyses showed that the frequency of MRSA infections was 43.0% (95% confidence interval 36.3¡V50.0%) among confirmed S. aureus isolates. Further stratified analyses indicated that the prevalence of MRSA was higher in studies performed after the year 2000. Conclusions Since a high rate of MRSA infections was seen in this analysis, regular surveillance of hospital-associated infections, monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity patterns, and formulation of definite antibiotic policy may facilitate more accurate action for the prevention and control of MRSA. ? 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer"

Many meta-analyses have investigated antibiotic prophylaxis for low-risk laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the aim of reducing unnecessary antibiotic use. Most of these meta-analyses have concluded that prophylactic antibiotics are not required for low-risk laparoscopic cholecystectomies. This study aimed to assess the validity of this conclusion by systematically reviewing these meta-analyses. Methods A systematic review was undertaken. Searches were limited to meta-analyses and systematic reviews. PubMed and Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched from inception until March 2016 using the following keyword combinations: antibiotic prophylaxis', laparoscopic cholecystectomy' and systematic review or meta-analysis'. Two independent reviewers selected meta-analyses or systematic reviews evaluating prophylactic antibiotics for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. All of the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) analysed in these meta-analyses were also reviewed. Results Seven meta-analyses regarding prophylactic antibiotics for low-risk laparoscopic cholecystectomy that had examined a total of 28 RCTs were included. Review of these meta-analyses revealed 48 miscounts of the number of outcomes. Six RCTs were inappropriate for the meta-analyses; one targeted patients with acute cholecystitis, another measured inappropriate outcomes, the original source of a third was not found and the study protocols of the remaining three were not appropriate for the meta-analyses. After correcting the above miscounts and excluding the six inappropriate RCTs, pooled risk ratios (RRs) were recalculated. These showed that, contrary to what had previously been concluded, antibiotics significantly reduced the risk of postoperative infections. The rates of surgical site, distant and overall infections were all significantly reduced by antibiotic administration (RR (95% CI); 0.71 (0.51 to 0.99), 0.37 (0.19 to 0.73), 0.50 (0.34 to 0.75), respectively).

Understanding risk factors associated with development of HBV is greatly important. Numerous studies focus on relationship between vitamin D receptor (VDR) polymorphisms (TaqI, FokI, ApaI, BsmI) and the risk of HBV infection in different ethnic groups. However the results published so far are inconsistent. The aim of this study is to quantify the association between VDR polymorphisms with HBV infection by meta-analysis approach. Methods A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Database of Chinese Scientific and Technical Periodicals (VIP), and WANFANG. All the relevant studies were published up to October 2016. Results Finally, 15 published studies included 4218 cases and 2298 controls were included in this meta-analysis. It is interesting to note that FokI FF tends to be a risk factor for HBV infection [FF vs. ff: P &lt; 0.01, OR (95%CI) = 1.54 (1.19¡V2.00), I2 = 0.0%], with no heterogeneity. In addition, genotype Ff and allele F could increase HBV infection risk [Ff vs. ff: P &lt; 0.01, OR (95%CI) = 1.39 (1.13¡V1.72); F vs. f: P = 0.02, OR (95%CI) = 1.23(1.04¡V1.45)]. However, no associations were found about VDR TaqI, ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms with HBV infection based on each comparison model. Conclusion This meta-analysis indicates that FokI genotype FF, Ff and allele F increase the risk of HBV infection. All these results support the notion that VDR FokI genotype might has potential role in HBV susceptibility. ? 2017"

Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) both colonize and infect, but the association between these entities is unclear. By conducting a systematic literature review, we aimed to explore the impact of factors on the association between GN colonization and GN-BSI at both baby-level and unit-level. Methods: We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Observational cohort studies published after 2000 up to June 2016 reporting data on the total number of neonates (0-28 days) colonized with GNB assessed by rectal/skin swab culture and the total number of neonates with GN-BSI (same bacteria) were included. Studies were excluded if data on skin/rectal colonization, neonates, and GNB could not be identified separately. Meta-analyses along with multivariate meta-regression with a random-effect model were performed to investigate factors associated with the GN colonization and GN-BSI at baby-level and unit-level. Results: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria, 15 for the baby-level and 12 for the unit-level analysis. Study heterogeneity was high, with suboptimal overall quality of reporting assessed by the STROBE-NI statement (44.8% of items adequately reported). In 1984 colonized neonates, 157 (7.9%) developed GN-BSI compared with 85 of 3583 (2.4%) non-colonized neonates. Considerable heterogeneity was observed across studies. Four factors were included in the meta-regression model: gross domestic product (GDP), pathogen, outbreak, and frequency of screening. There was no statistically significant impact of these factors on GN colonization and GN-BSI in baby-level. We were unable to perform the multivariate meta-regression because of insufficient reported data for unit-level. Conclusions: Study limitations include the small number and the high heterogeneity of the included studies. While this report shows a correlation between colonization and BSI risk, these data currently do not support routine screening for GNB. Analysis of large cohorts of colonized neonates with clinical outcomes is still needed to define the major determinants leading from colonization to infection. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

GBS is a debilitating autoimmune disorder that affects peripheral nerves. Since ZIKV caused massive outbreaks in South America in the past few years, we aimed to systematically review the literature and perform a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of GBS among ZIKV-infected individuals.

There was a statistically significant reduction in A1c at ? 52 weeks favouring SGLT-2i compared to DPP-4i (MD [95% CI] = ?0.11% [?0.20, ?0.03]) but no significant difference at ? 26 weeks (MD [95% CI] = ?0.05% [?0.16, 0.05]). SGLT-2i caused significantly more weight loss compared to DPP-4i at ? 26 weeks and ? 52 weeks (MD [95% CI] = ?2.31 kg [?2.66, ?1.96] and ?2.45 kg [?2.83, ?2.07], respectively). SGLT-2i treated patients had a significantly more genital infection compared to DPP-4i. On restricting the analysis according to the SGLT-2i FDA-approved dose, only higher doses at ? 52 weeks showed a statistically significant reduction in A1c compared to DPP-4i. On restricting the analysis according to baseline A1c, results favoured DPP-4i if baseline A1c was < 8.5%, but favoured SGLT-2i if ? 8.5%. Conclusion: While both SGLT-2i and DPP-4i can reduce A1c, SGLT-2i causes a more robust A1c reduction and more weight loss but with more genital infections. Higher doses of SGLT-2i showed more efficacy when compared to DPP-4i; however, this data should be interpreted cautiously given the limited number of trials. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS"

The therapeutic role of atropine is well-established for patients with acute OP poisoning. The benefit of adding 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride (2-PAM), however, is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare 2-PAM plus atropine in comparison to atropine alone for acute OP poisoning. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS up to March 2017. The Cochrane review handbook was used to assess the risk of bias. Data were abstracted and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for mortality, rate of intubation, duration of intubation, intermediate syndrome, and complications such as hospital-acquired infections, dysrhythmias, and pulmonary edema. We found five studies comprising 586 patients with varying risks of bias. The risk of death (RR?=?1.5, 95% CI 0.9¡V2.5); intubation (RR?=?1.3, 95% CI 1.0¡V1.6); intermediate syndrome (RR?=?1.6, 95% CI 1.0¡V2.6); complications (RR?=?1.2, 95% CI 0.8¡V1.8); and the duration of intubation (mean difference 0.0, 95% CI ??1.6¡V1.6) were not significantly different between the atropine plus 2-PAM and atropine alone.

Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, CNKI and Wanfang. Cochrane collaboration's tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used to evaluate literature qualities. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results: Eight studies were eligible, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and six retrospective cohort trials. There were no significant differences between suprapatellar and infrapatellar approaches in operation time, coronal plane alignment, and incidence of postoperative deep infection, nonunion and secondary operation. However, suprapatellar nailing achieved a significant shorter fluoroscopy time, less VAS pain score, better sagittal plane alignment and lower incidence of angular malalignment. Though pooled results indicated no significant difference in terms of final follow-up knee functional score, the RCT subgroup analysis showed that a higher knee functional score existed in suprapatellar group. Conclusions: For tibia IMN, suprapatellar approach might be superior to infrapatellar approach with shorter fluoroscopy time, less knee pain, better knee function recovery, and more accurate fracture reduction. Meanwhile, no increased risk of postoperative complications was identified. More RCTs are required for further research. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

While many of the risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in western countries are well-recognized, it remains unclear whether they are the same in Thailand. We set out to investigate the risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand. Methods: Starting March 4, 2016, we reviewed studies found using pre-specified keywords on SCOPUS, Pro Quest Science Direct, PubMed, and online public access catalog of Khon Kaen University. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the studied Risk of Bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess the quality of included studies. The risk effects of factors were estimated as a pooled adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. The heterogeneity of results was considered using the I-square, Tau-square and Chi-square statistics. Results: A strong association was found between cholangiocarcinoma and age, Opisthorchis viverrini infection, eating raw cyprinoid fish, family history of cancer, liquor consumption, and taking praziquantel. There was only a mild association found between eating nitrite-containing foods, fresh vegetables, education, smoking behavior, and sex. No association was found between cholangiocarcinoma and eating fermented fish (Pla-ra), northeastern Thai or Chinese sausage, sticky rice, meat, chewing betel nut, or eating fruit. There were two protective factors including fresh vegetables consumption and education attainment.

We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the safety and efficacy of velpatasvir plus sofosbuvir in the treatment of chronic HCV infection. A computerized literature search of PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, EBSCO, Web of science, and Cochrane CENTRAL was conducted using relevant keywords. Data from eligible studies were pooled in a fixed effect meta-analysis model, using OpenMeta[Analyst] software. Pooled data from six randomized trials (n = 1427 patients) showed that velpatasvir plus sofosbuvir achieved sustained virological response (SVR12) rates of 98.2% in genotype-1, 99.4% in genotype-2, 94.7% in genotype-3, 99.6% in genotype-4, 97.1% in genotype-5, and 98.8% in genotype-6 patients. The addition of ribavirin did not significantly increase the SVR12 (RR = 0.95, 95%CI [0.88, 1.02]) or decrease relapse rates (RR = 2.52, 95% CI [0.49, 12.87]) in HCV genotype-1 patients. However, adding ribavirin significantly increased SVR12 (RR = 89.5, 95% CI [80.4, 99.5]) in genotype-3 patients. In conclusion, the 12-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir was highly effective in HCV patients, including those with cirrhosis and former treatment experience. Except for genotype-3, adding ribavirin was not associated with significant improvements in SVR12 rates. Further studies should investigate the effect of adding ribavirin to this regimen, especially in HCV genotype-3 patients. ? 2017 The Authors"

However, robust real-world evidence of interferon (IFN)-free DAA treatment for HCV GT1-infected patients in Asia is still lacking. Aim: To systematically review and meta-analyse the effectiveness and tolerability of IFN-free DAA therapy for HCV GT1 infection in Asia. Methods: We included studies that enrolled adult patients with HCV GT1 infection in routine clinical practice in Asia, using IFN-free DAA regimens, and reported sustained virological response (SVR) after 12/24?weeks end-of-treatment by 31 May 2017. The pooled SVR rates were computed with a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression as previously registered in PROSPERO were performed to determine how pre-planned variables might have affected the pooled estimates. Results: We included 41 studies from eight countries and regions, comprising of 8574 individuals.

In the male-to-female (MtF) transgendered patient, the creation of esthetic and functional external female genitalia with a functional vaginal channel is of the utmost importance. The aim of this review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the epidemiology, presentation, management, and outcomes of neovaginal complications in the MtF transgender reassignment surgery patients. PUBMED was searched in accordance with PRISMA guidelines for relevant articles (n = 125). Ineligible articles were excluded and articles meeting all inclusion criteria went on to review and analysis (n = 13). Ultimately, studies reported on 1,684 patients with an overall complication rate of 32.5% and a reoperation rate of 21.7% for non-esthetic reasons. The most common complication was stenosis of the neo-meatus (14.4%). Wound infection was associated with an increased risk of all tissue-healing complications. Use of sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSL) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of prolapse of the neovagina. Gender-affirmation surgery is important in the treatment of gender dysphoric patients, but there is a high complication rate in the reported literature.

Methods: Embase, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library (January 1970 to July 2017) were searched for studies reporting clinical outcomes of LARS in patient cohorts stratified by Body Mass Index (BMI). Data was grouped according to BMI, &lt;30 kg/m2 (non-obese) and ?30 kg/m2 (obese). Primary outcome measures were reflux recurrence, operative morbidity, re-intervention (redo surgery and endoscopic dilatation), conversion to open surgery, and early return to theatre. Results were pooled in meta-analyses as Odds Ratios (OR). Results: Thirteen eligible observational studies comparing LARS in non-obese (n = 6246) and obese (n = 1753) patients were identified. Recurrence of reflux was significantly lower in the non-obese cohort (OR 0.28, 95% C.I. 0.13 to 0.61, p = 0.001), however no significant differences were observed in rates of operative morbidity (OR 0.82, 0.54 to 1.23, p = 0.33), redo surgery (OR 0.94, 0.51 to 1.72, p = 0.84), endoscopic dilatation (OR 0.98, 0.45 to 2.17, p = 0.97), conversion to open surgery (OR 0.96, 0.50 to 1.85, P = 0.90), or early return to theatre (OR 0.77, 0.43 to 1.38, p = 0.39). Conclusions: LARS can be performed safely in obese patients, but risks higher GORD recurrence.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of this additive on the duration of postoperative analgesia, postoperative vomiting, and possible adverse events in pediatrics. Methods: We searched databases, conference records, and registered trials for randomized controlled trials. The databases included the Cochrane Library, JBI Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Science-Direct, and Embase. Odds ratio, weighted mean difference, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the REVMAN software, version 5.3, for data synthesis and statistical analysis, which following the PRISMA statement. The main outcomes were duration of postoperative analgesia (time from the end of surgery to first administration of analgesics as evidenced by a pain score) and postoperative vomiting. Results: Seven studies were selected for this meta-analysis, involving 647 pediatric patients. All the patients were randomized to receive caudal or intravenous dexamethasone with caudal block (experimental group) or plain caudal block (control group). There was significantly longer duration of postoperative analgesia in the experimental group compared with control group (weighted mean difference: 238.40?minutes; 95% CI: 193.41-283.40; P?<.00001). The experimental group had fewer patients who needed analgesics after surgery (odds ratio: 0.18?minutes; 95% CI: 0.05-0.66; P?=.009). Additionally, the number of subjects who remained pain-free to 2, 6, 24, and 48?hours after operation was significantly greater in the experimental group than control group. Side effects in these 2 groups were comparable (odds ratio: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.34-2.56; P?=.90). The incidence of postoperative vomiting was significantly decreased in the experimental group compared with control group (odds ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.13-0.63; P?=.002). Conclusion: Caudal and intravenous dexamethasone could provide longer duration of postoperative analgesia and reduced the incidence of postoperative vomiting with comparable adverse effects than plain caudal block. However, any additive to the caudal space carries with it the potential for neurotoxicity and that caution should always be exercised when weighting the risks and benefits of any additive.

Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS, and MEDLINE to identify all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing complications of ST and PDT and to define the strategy with the lower risk of potentially life-threatening events. Risk of bias was assessed using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook.

The present study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the seroprevalence rate and population genetic structure of human CE in the eastern Mediterranean region. To estimate the population genetic structure, Echinococcus sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene isolated from countries from this geographical area were retrieved from the GenBank database. An electronic search for articles from 1990 until 2015 was performed using databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. A total of 53 articles reporting on CE seroprevalence and genotyping data met our eligibility criteria and were included in a meta-analysis. The overall CE seroprevalence rates in the general population and in individuals at high risk of infection were estimated using the random-effect model at 7.4% (95% CI = 4.8¡V10.6) and 10.7% (95% CI = 7.6¡V14.3), respectively. Risk factors including age group (P < 0.001), dog ownership (P = 0.03), residence area (P < 0.001), and educational level (P = 0.04) showed a statistically significant association with CE seroprevalence. A pairwise fixation index (Fst), used as an estimation of gene flow, suggested a moderate level of genetic differentiation between members of the E. granulosus sensu stricto (G1-G3) complex from Iranian and Turkish metapopulations (Fst = 0.171). The finding of common haplotypes may represent an ancestral transfer of alleles among populations probably during the early stages of animal domestication. The high CE seroprevalence rates found highlight the necessity of implementing appropriate public education for preventive and control strategies, particularly in individuals at high risk of infection; furthermore, our genetic findings reveal novel molecular data concerning microevolutionary events of Echinococcus isolates among Middle East countries. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

Furthermore, SPLT group had significantly higher incidence of postoperative hemorrhage (OR = 3.07, 95% CI: 1.92-4.91), postoperative thrombosis (OR = 3.63, 95% CI: 1.06-12.45), and perioperative infection (OR = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.76-3.90). In addition, perioperative mortality was significantly higher in the SPLT group (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.31-7.52). Postoperative hospital stay did not differ significantly between 2 groups (OR = -1.75, 95% CI: -3.66-0.16). Conclusions: Splenectomy benefits LT patients in increasing platelet count. However, splenectomy is a morbid procedure as splenectomy increases operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative RBC transfusion, and postoperative complications. Splenectomy does not improve OS but increase perioperative mortality. Therefore, splenectomy should be performed only in selective patients. ? 2018 the Author(s).

Mutations in the cytochrome bc1 complex are causally associated with atovaquone resistance. Methods: This systematic review assesses the clinical efficacy of atovaquone/proguanil treatment of uncomplicated malaria and examines the extent to which codon 268 mutation in cytochrome b influences treatment failure and recrudescence based on published information. Results: Data suggest that atovaquone/proguanil treatment efficacy is 89%-98% for P. falciparum malaria (from 27 studies including between 18 and 253 patients in each case) and 20%-26% for Plasmodium vivax malaria (from 1 study including 25 patients). The in vitro P. falciparum phenotype of atovaquone resistance is an IC50 value &gt;28 nM. Case report analyses predict that recrudescence in a patient presenting with parasites carrying cytochrome b codon 268 mutation will occur on average at day 29 (95% CI: 22, 35), 19 (95% CI: 7, 30) days longer than if the mutation is absent. Conclusions: Evidence suggests atovaquone/proguanil treatment for P. falciparum malaria is effective. Late treatment failure is likely to be associated with a codon 268 mutation in cytochrome b, though recent evidence from animal models suggests these mutations may not spread within the population. However, early treatment failure is likely to arise through alternative mechanisms, requiring further investigation. ? The Author 2017.

We aimed to describe and compare the relevant epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics of all reported cases of septic meningitis associated with the use of spinal and epidural anesthetics. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review of septic meningitis associated with neuraxial anesthesia. We included all relevant case-reports and observational studies in which authors described septic meningitis in association with spinal, epidural or combined neuraxial anesthesia using local anesthetics. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A total of 234 cases of septic meningitis were reported following review of 71 case-report articles and 22 epidemiological studies. In total, there have been 199, 25 and 10 reported cases of septic meningitis associated to spinal, epidural and combined neuraxial anesthesia, respectively. The lack of use of surgical masks was the most common risk factor (41, 16.7%). Streptococcus salivarius was the most common bacteria (17.0%) related to spinal anesthesia and Staphylococcus aureus (26.7%) was the most common one related to epidural. The time to symptom onset was significantly reduced in spinal (median time, 24 hours IQR [8-72] vs. 96 hours IQR [84-240]; P=0.003) compared to epidural anesthesia. The overall mortality rate is 15.3% and 13.3% for reported cases related to spinal and epidural anesthesia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While the true incidence remains speculative, this review suggests that given increasing indications for spinals and epidurals, septic meningitis remains an important associated with neuraxial anesthesia. ? 2017 Edizioni Minerva Medica."

The current first-choice therapy is metronidazole. Recently, other drugs with potentially higher efficacy or with fewer and milder side effects have increased in popularity, but evidence is limited by a scarcity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the many treatment options available. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a useful tool to compare multiple treatments when there is limited or no direct evidence available. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and side effects of all available drugs for the treatment of giardiasis. Methods: We selected all RCTs included in systematic reviews and expert reviews of all treatments for giardiasis published until 2014, extended the systematic literature search until 2016, and identified new studies by scanning reference lists for relevant studies. We then conducted an NMA of all available treatments for giardiasis by comparing parasitological cure (efficacy) and side effects. Results: We identified 60 RCTs from 58 reports (46 from published systematic reviews, 8 from reference lists and 4 from the updated systematic search). Data from 6714 patients, 18 treatments and 42 treatment comparisons were available. Tinidazole was associated with higher parasitological cure than metronidazole [relative risk (RR) 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.35] and albendazole (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.21-1.50). Taking into consideration clinical efficacy, side effects and amount of the evidence, tinidazole was found to be the most effective drug. Conclusions: We provide additional evidence that single-dose tinidazole is the best available treatment for giardiasis in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults. ? The Author 2017.

MIS is associated with theoretical advantages, but there is no consensus regarding to the best treatment method for hepatolithiasis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of MIS hepatectomy compared with those of open hepatectomy in hepatolithiasis patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The data were analyzed with Stata version 12.0 software. Meta-regression analysis was used to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Egger's tests and Begg's funnel plots were employed to evaluate the publication biases. Results: In total, 12 nonrandomized controlled trials were identified. Compared with open hepatectomy, the volume of intraoperative blood loss was significantly less in MIS hepatectomy (SMD = -0.226, P = 0.000). The intraoperative blood transfusion rate was also lower in MIS hepatectomy (RR = 0.569, P = 0.003). A shorter length of postoperative hospital stay was noted with MIS hepatectomy (SMD = -0.537, P = 0.000). MIS hepatectomy resulted in a lower rate of postoperative complications than open hepatectomy (RR = 0.595, P = 0.000). However, MIS hepatectomy resulted in a longer operation time (SMD = 0.473, P = 0.005). No significant differences were noted between MIS and open hepatectomy in the initial stone clearance rate (RR = 1.33, P = 0.218), the final stone clearance rate (RR = 1.040, P = 0.131), the stone recurrence rate (RR = 0.558, P = 0.072) or the cholangitis recurrence rate (RR = 0.610, P = 0.285). Conclusions: MIS hepatectomy is a safe approach for hepatolithiasis patients. MIS hepatectomy significantly reduces intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion, postoperative hospital stay time and complications. The stone clearance and recurrence rates were similar for MIS hepatectomy and open hepatectomy. Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials and Western studies are needed to confirm these findings. ? 2018 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

A total of 491 articles were collected and eight randomized studies were identified as eligible for this meta-analysis. Overall, eight trials were included in the meta-analysis evaluating 10 248 patients. Mirabegron at both doses of 50 mg and 100 mg, and and tolterodine 4 mg were significantly associated with the reduction of incontinence episodes per 24 h, reduction of mean number of micturitions per 24 h, increase of voided volume and reduction of urgency episodes per 24 h, compared to a placebo. Both mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg were associated with a significant reduction of nocturia episodes when compared with a placebo. Conversely, tolterodine 4 mg did not prove to be more effective than a placebo in the reduction of nocturia episodes. Furthermore, mirabegron 50 mg showed a slightly, but significantly, better efficacy than tolterodine 4 mg in the improvement of nocturia episodes. Mirabegron 50 mg and mirabegron 100 mg shared the same risk of overall treatment-emergent adverse events rate with the placebo. Otherwise, tolterodine 4 mg was associated with a significantly greater risk than the placebo. However, mirabegron 100 mg showed a slight trend toward an increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio 1.41; P = 0.08) and cardiac arrhythmia (odds ratio 2.18; P = 0.06). Mirabegron is an effective treatment for patients with storage lower urinary tract symptoms/overactive bladder, providing a reduction of incontinence, urgency and frequency; an improvement of voided volume with a slight, but statistically, significant improvement of nocturia; with a good safety profile. These findings should be considered for the treatment planning of patients with storage lower urinary tract symptoms/overactive bladder. ? 2017 The Japanese Urological Association"

However, the prognostic value of EBV-DNA in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma remains unclear. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate its prognostic significance. PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were used to search for studies conducted until June 12, 2017. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to evaluate the prognostic value of pretreatment EBV-DNA on the overall survival of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Seven eligible studies on 356 patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma were pooled for this meta-analysis. Results suggested that the pretreatment EBV-DNA positivity was significantly correlated with the overall survival of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (pooled HR =3.78, 95% CI: 1.52-9.40, p=0.004; heterogeneity test: I2=52%, p=0.05). Subgroup analyses stratified by sample type, survival analysis mode, and HR origin showed that patients with positive pretreatment EBV-DNA had poorer prognosis than those with negative pretreatment EBV-DNA. Moreover, the cut-off value (HR =1.66; 95% CI: 0.73-3.73; p=0.22) might account for the heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was observed. Pretreatment EBV-DNA positivity can predict poor prognosis for patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.

Purpose: To summarize and compare the prognostic accuracy of qSOFA and the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for prediction of mortality in adult patients with suspected infection. Data Sources: Four databases from inception through November 2017. Study Selection: English-language studies using qSOFA for prediction of mortality (in-hospital, 28-day, or 30-day) in adult patients with suspected infection in the intensive care unit (ICU), emergency department (ED), or hospital wards. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed study quality using standard criteria. Data Synthesis: Thirty-eight studies were included (n = 385 333). qSOFA was associated with a pooled sensitivity of 60.8% (95% CI, 51.4% to 69.4%) and a pooled specificity of 72.0% (CI, 63.4% to 79.2%) for mortality. The SIRS criteria were associated with a pooled sensitivity of 88.1% (CI, 82.3% to 92.1%) and a pooled specificity of 25.8% (CI, 17.1% to 36.9%). The pooled sensitivity of qSOFA was higher in the ICU population (87.2% [CI, 75.8% to 93.7%]) than the non-ICU population (51.2% [CI, 43.6% to 58.7%]). The pooled specificity of qSOFA was higher in the non-ICU population (79.6% [CI, 73.3% to 84.7%]) than the ICU population (33.3% [CI, 23.8% to 44.4%]). Limitation: Potential risk of bias in included studies due to qSOFA interpretation and patient selection. Conclusion: qSOFA had poor sensitivity and moderate specificity for short-Term mortality. The SIRS criteria had sensitivity superior to that of qSOFA, supporting their use for screening of patients and as a prompt for treatment initiation.

However in sub Saharan Africa (SSA), the low level of involvement of male partners may hinder the uptake of such services by HIV positive mothers. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of male partner involvement approaches on the uptake of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis in SSA. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane library, ClinicalTrials.gov, Web of Science and Current Controlled Trials were searched from 1st December 2015 up until 30th March 2016. Only studies carried out in SSA that reported an approach used in involving male partners and the impact on the uptake of infant antiretroviral prophylaxis irrespective of the Language and date of publication were included.

Immunopathological studies have shown that platelets are an important component of the host innate immune response against malaria infections. The objectives of this study were to quantify thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria patients and to determine the associated risks of severe thrombocytopaenia in patients with vivax malaria compared to patients with P. falciparum malaria. Main body: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature on thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria patients was undertaken. Relevant studies in health-related electronic databases were identified and reviewed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Fifty-eight observational studies (n=29664) were included in the current review. Severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt;50000/mm3) to very severe thrombocytopaenia (&lt;20000/mm3) was observed in 10.1% of patients with P. vivax infection. A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies showed an equal risk of developing severe/very severe thrombocytopaenia between the patients with P. vivax malaria and those with P. falciparum malaria (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.92-4.25). This indicates that thrombocytopaenia is as equally a common manifestation in P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria patients. One study showed a higher risk of developing very severe thrombocytopaenia in children with severe P. vivax malaria than with severe P. falciparum malaria (OR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.48-5.29). However, a pooled analysis of two studies showed an equal risk among adult severe cases (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.51-2.77). This indicates that the risk of developing thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria can vary with immune status in both children and adults. One study reported higher levels of urea and serum bilirubin in patients with P. vivax malaria and severe thrombocytopaenia compared with patients mild thrombocytopaenia or no thrombocytopaenia, (P&lt;0.001 in all comparisons). A pooled analysis of two other studies showed a similar proportion of bleeding episodes with thrombocytopaenia in severe P. vivax patients and severe P. falciparum patients (P=0.09). This implied that both P. vivax and P. falciparum infections could present with bleeding episodes, if there had been a change in platelet counts in the infected patients. A pooled analysis of another two studies showed an equal risk of mortality with severe thrombocytopaenia in both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria patients (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.30-4.60). However, due to the low number of studies with small sample sizes within the subset of studies that provided clinically relevant information, our confidence in the estimates is limited. Conclusion: The current review has provided some evidence of the clinical relevance of severe thrombocytopaenia in P. vivax malaria. To substantiate these findings, there is a need for well designed, large-scale, prospective studies among patients infected with P. vivax. These should include patients from different countries and epidemiological settings with various age and gender groups represented. ? 2018 The Author(s)."

We evaluate the influence of HCV infection on antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination by a systematic review of published works with a meta-analysis of clinical trials. The random-effects model of DerSimonian and Laird with heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were used in this study. The end-point of interest was the rate of patients showing seroconversion of antibody responses at completion of hepatitis B vaccination schedule among patients with chronic HCV infection versus healthy controls. We identified 11 studies involving 704 patients with HCV and 812 controls. Our results show a significant decrease in antibody seroconversion rates among patients with HCV versus healthy controls (pooled odds ratio = 0.17 [95% confidence interval, 0.11¡V0.28]).

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2018,Transfusion,10.1111/trf.14416,29194668,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of a donor medical questionnaire is to identify the blood donor's history relative to the current known blood-safety risks. A temporary deferral from blood donation after an endoscopic examination is enforced because of the reusable nature of the endoscope and close contact with the inner body. The objective of this systematic review was to find the best available evidence on the association between an endoscopic examination and the risk of transfusion-transmissible infections. METHODS: Studies from five databases investigating the link between an endoscopic examination and transfusion-transmissible infections (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus infection, Treponema pallidum) were retained and assessed independently by two reviewers. The association between endoscopy and transfusion-transmissible infections was identified by conducting meta-analyses and calculating pooled effect measures (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology was used to assess the quality of evidence. RESULTS: We identified 7571 references and finally included 29 observational studies. A significant association between an endoscopic examination and hepatitis B virus infection (pooled odds ratio [OR], 2.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-3.86; p = 0.005) or hepatitis C virus infection (pooled OR 1.76, 95% CI, 1.45-2.14; p < 0.00001) was found. The level of evidence was considered as ¡§very low¡¨ due to the type of study design (i.e., observational) and indirect study populations (i.e., no blood donor populations). CONCLUSION: An endoscopic examination is associated with an increased hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection risk. Further high-quality trials are required to formulate stronger evidence-based recommendations on endoscopic examination as a blood donor deferral criterion. ? 2017 The Authors Transfusion published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of AABB"

Area covered: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials comparing novel BL/BLIs with other antibiotics for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI. The primary outcome included clinical and microbiological treatment success. Expert commentary: We found that novel BL/BLIs obtained a similar clinical outcome with other antibiotics in CE population (OR = 1.07, 95%CI = (0.80, 1.44), P = 0.64). However, novel BL/BLIs had better clinical treatment success in the cUTI subgroup (OR = 2.14, 95%CI = (1.06, 4.31), P = 0.03). Furthermore, novel BL/BLIs achieved significant microbiological treatment success in patie nts with cUTI (OR?=?1.70, 95%CI?=?(1.29, 2.25), P = 0.0002) and had higher eradication rates for Gram-negative pathogens (OR?=?1.82, 95%CI?=?(1.26, 2.64), P?=?0.001) including E.coli and K.pneumoniae. No difference was observed concerning the incidence of mortality and adverse events between the two groups. Therefore, we concluded that novel BL/BLIs are not inferior to other available antibiotics for the treatment of cIAI, and they have advantages in patients with cUTI. Simultaneously, they are sensitive to Gram-negative pathogens, especially for E.coli and K.pneumoniae. ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Design Meta-analysis. Background Split-thickness skin grafts are widely used in reconstruction of large skin defects. Conventional therapy causes pain during dressing changing. NPWT is an alternative method to cover the wound bed. Methods The Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or cohort studies for articles published between 1993 and April 2017 comparing NPWT to conventional wound therapy for split-thickness skin grafts. The rate of graft take was the primary outcome of this meta-analysis. Wound infection and reoperation rate of the wound were secondary outcomes. Data analysis was conducted using the Review Manager 5.3 software. Results Five cohort studies and seven RCTs including 653 patients were eligible for inclusion. Patients treated with NPWT had a significantly higher rate of graft take compared to those treated with conventional therapy [MD = 7.02, (95% CI 3.74, 10.31)] (P =.00). NPWT was associated with a reduction in reoperation [RR = 0.28, (95% CI 0.14, 0.55)] (P =.00). The reduction in wound infection was not significant [RR = 0.63, (95% CI 0.31, 1.27)] (P =.20). Conclusion Compared with conventional therapy, NPWT significantly increases the rate of graft take and reduces the rate of reoperation when applied to cover the wound bed with split-thickness skin graft. No significant impact on wound infection was found in this study. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

Cardiac infection represents an emblematic example where the use of nuclear molecular techniques is evolving as an important supplementary method for patients with suspected infection and diagnostic difficulties. Positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) using fluor-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using radiolabeled leukocyte (WBC) have been widely used in the diagnosis of infections. The aim of the present work is to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published data on the use of hybrid nuclear medicine imaging [18F]FDG PET/CT and radiolabeled leukocyte SPECT in the diagnostic workup of patients with IE and CIED infection. Materials and methods: An English literature search was performed using the PubMed, Cochrane and Web of Science databases to identify articles. Studies were included if they assessed the diagnostic accuracy of [18F]FDG PET/CT and SPECT or SPECT/CT WBC in the diagnosis of possible infection, provided detailed criteria of a reference standard for diagnosis of infection, and provided sufficient data to determine sensitivity and specificity of [18F]FDG PET/CT and WBC SPECT¡VSPECT/CT. A first analysis was performed considering IE as endpoint and compared [18F]FDG PET/CT and WBC SPECT¡VSPECT/CT imaging. A second analysis considered CIED as endpoint was performed only on [18F]FDG PET imaging without a comparison with SPECT¡VSPECT/CT. Two additional analysis were performed, including (i) the sub-analysis of the manuscripts dealing with IE that were evaluated considering separately the ones dealing with NVE and PVE, (ii) the sub-analysis of the manuscripts for IE and CIED where patients underwent a specific preparation before undergoing [18F]FDG PET/CT scan. Results: The IE group included 14 [18F]FDG PET/CT and 3 SPECT/CT studies, while the CIED infection set comprised 13 [18F]FDG PET/CT and 1 SPECT/CT. For the subsequent sub-analysis within the group of IE studies, we included seven studies for NVE (all the ones with?<?50% patients with native valve) and 11 studies for PVE (all patients with prosthetic valve or with?>?50% patients with prosthetic valve). The sub-analysis, considering preparation protocols before [18F]FDG PET/CT scan, included 17 studies. [18F]FDG PET/CT had good specificity (89%) and lower sensitivity (71%), with high heterogeneity amongst studies. In the sub-analysis of 18 manuscripts dealing with NVE and PVE, sensitivity and specificity for NVE are 71 and 97%, respectively, while for PVE sensitivity and specificity were 83 and 92%. For WBC SPECT/CT, we found an overall sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100%, even in the early post-intervention phase. When proper patients¡¦ preparation is performed, sensitivity increased from 72 to 76% and specificity from 86 to 90%. Conclusions: [18F]FDG PET/CT and WBC SPECT/CT are useful for the diagnosis of IE and CIED infection. WBC SPECT¡VSPECT/CT appears to be slightly more specific than [18F]FDG PET/CT. On the other hand, [18F]FDG PET/CT has the advantage of being faster and very sensitive, with the great potential to allow an overall evaluation of the burden of the disease including clinically relevant extra-cardiac foci of infection, leading to timely and appropriate patients¡¦ management. ? 2018, Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging."

Different bearing surface materials have different surface properties and it has been suggested that the choice of bearing surface may influence the risk of PJI after THA. The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the rate of PJI between metal-onpolyethylene (MoP), ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP), and ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) bearings. Patients and Methods Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) were searched for comparative randomized and observational studies that reported the incidence of PJI for different bearing surfaces. Two investigators independently reviewed studies for eligibility, evaluated risk of bias, and performed data extraction. Meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenzel method and random-effects model in accordance with methods of the Cochrane group. Results Our search strategy revealed 2272 studies, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. These comprised 11 randomized controlled trials and six observational studies. The overall quality of included studies was high but the observational studies were at high risk of bias due to inadequate adjustment for confounding factors. The overall cumulative incidence of PJI across all studies was 0.78% (1514/193 378). For each bearing combination, the overall incidence was as follows: MoP 0.85% (1353/158 430); CoP 0.38% (67/17 489); and CoC 0.53% (94/17 459). The meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the three bearing combinations in terms of risk of PJI. Conclusion On the basis of the clinical studies available, there is no evidence that bearing choice influences the risk of PJI. Future research, including basic science studies and large, adequately controlled registry studies, may be helpful in determining whether implant materials play a role in determining the risk of PJI following arthroplasty surgery. ? 2018 The British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery."

Th17 inhibitors could replace TNF-£\ antagonists as first-line biologic agents. We determined the overall treatment effect of Th17 pathway inhibitors compared to placebo or active control on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 12 (primary objective), risk of infections, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events, and serious adverse events during the placebo-controlled period (12-24 weeks) in adults with active PsA in published randomized controlled trials. Methods: The SCOPUS database was searched. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for assessing quality. The pooled relative risk (RR) was derived from random effects models. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials were included which randomized 1,718 patients to Th17 inhibitors and 840 to placebo. Patients treated with Th17 inhibitors had an RR of 2.04 (95% CI: 1.79-2.33; p &lt; 0.001) for achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 (I2 = 0%; p = 0.89) compared to placebo-treated patients. There was no evidence of publication bias. The result was consistent for study phase and outcome (ACR50/70), mechanism of action and TNF-£\ naivety. RR of infections was 1.06 (0.91-1.23), that of candida infections was 3.35 (0.75-14.95), that of serious adverse events was 0.82 (0.42-1.59) and that of discontinuation of treatment was 0.54 (0.31-0.93) among treated versus placebo subjects.

Systematic search from Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online was carried out and retrieved nine eligible articles (of 131) based on phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL-PE between 2005 and 2016 in Tanzania. Analysis was performed using STATA 11.0 software to delineate the prevalence of ESBL-PE, phenotypic resistance profiles and clones circulating in the three interfaces. The overall prevalence of ESBL-PE in the three interfaces was 22.6% (95% CI: 21.1¡V24.2) with the predominance of Escherichia coli (E.?coli) strains (51.6%). The majority of ESBL-PE were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobials such as trimethoprim¡Vsulfamethoxazole and tetracycline/doxycycline, 38%¡V55% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and all were sensitive to meropenem/imipenem.

We aimed at including randomized controlled trials with patiromer in patients with developed or risks of developing hyperkalemia, comparing against an active comparator or placebo. Three studies matched our inclusion and exclusion criteria, which we included in the meta-analysis. All-cause mortality, reduction in hospitalization, episodes of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events during the treatment period were our primary outcomes. Serial change in serum potassium (K+) until end of treatment or follow-up during the trial period and all other reported adverse reactions during the treatment period were our secondary outcomes. Meta-analysis (RevMan version 5.3.5) and descriptive statistics were used. Results: There was a non-significant improvement in all-cause mortality and serious cardiovascular events with patiromer than placebo. Hospitalization data were unavailable. Although serious gastrointestinal events were more common with placebo, there was a significant reduction (P =.02) in the risk of non-serious gastrointestinal events with placebo. Patiromer lowered serum K+ more than placebo, and there were more patients developing hyperkalemia with placebo. High-dose patiromer was associated with better efficacy in some parameters but with more adverse events. Conclusion: Although patiromer seems promising, more trials with active comparator are essential to finalize its indication and use in hyperkalemia. ? 2017, ? The Author(s) 2017."

During storage, the RBCs and storage medium undergo changes, which may have clinical consequences. Several trials now have assessed these consequences, and we reviewed the present evidence on the effects of shorter versus longer storage time of transfused RBCs on outcomes in ICU patients. Methods: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses (TSA) of randomised clinical trials including adult ICU patients transfused with fresher versus older or standard issue blood. Results: We included seven trials with a total of 18,283 randomised ICU patients; two trials of 7504 patients were judged to have low risk of bias. We observed no effects of fresher versus older blood on death (relative risk 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97¡V1.11; 7349 patients; TSA-adjusted CI 0.93¡V1.15), adverse events (1.26, 0.76¡V2.09; 7332 patients; TSA-adjusted CI 0.16¡V9.87) or post-transfusion infections (1.07, 0.96¡V1.20; 7332 patients; TSA-adjusted CI 0.90¡V1.27). The results were unchanged by including trials with high risk of bias. TSA confirmed the results and the required information size was reached for mortality for a relative risk change of 20%. Conclusions: We may be able to reject a clinically meaningful effect of RBC storage time on mortality in transfused adult ICU patients as our trial sequential analyses reject a 10% relative risk change in death when comparing fresher versus older blood for transfusion. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature and ESICM."

That is the reason for the high conversion rate. Reports on outcomes of converted cases after laparoscopic rectal resection for cancer are conflicting. Aim: The present meta-analysis compares short- and long-term outcomes between converted rectal cancer cases with both open and laparoscopically completed cases. Method: All studies reporting on outcomes separately for the converted cases were reviewed systematically. Main outcomes were intraoperative complications, procedure duration, short-term mortality and morbidity, length of stay, local recurrence, number of lymph nodes retrieved, and distant metastases. Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by 3 reviewers. Results: Fourteen studies were eligible for analysis, including 10,845 patients. Overall conversion rate was 11.9%. Converted cases had significantly longer duration, hospital stay, and higher rates of wound infection compared with laparoscopic cases. All other outcomes had no difference. When compared with open cases, conversions displayed longer operative times, but there was no other significant difference in the short- or long-term outcomes.

The aim of this systematic review was to synthesise the evidence to achieve a better understanding of what proportion of patients are linked to care and what factors impact linkage. Methods Systematic searches were run in six databases up to the end of February 2017. The grey literature was also reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: sample size 50 people (aged 15), from the WHO European Region, published 2006¡V2017 and in English. Linkage to care was defined as a patient seen for HIV care after diagnosis. Study selection, data extraction and quality assurance were performed by two independent reviewers. Random-effects meta-analysis was carried out to summarise linkage to care within three months of diagnosis. Results Twenty-four studies were included; 22 presented linkage to care data and seven examined factors for linkage. Linkage among 89,006 people in 19 countries was captured. Meta-analysis, restricted to 12 studies and measuring prompt linkage within three months, gave a pooled estimate of 85% (95% CI: 75%-93%). Prompt linkage was higher in studies including only people in care (94%; 95% CI: 91%-97%) than in those of all new diagnoses (71%; 95% CI: 50%-87%). Heterogeneity was high across and within strata (>99%). Factors associated with delaying or not linking to care included: acquiring HIV through heterosexual contact/ injecting drug use, younger age at diagnosis, lower levels of education, feeling well at diagnosis and diagnosis outside an STI clinic. Conclusion Overall, linkage to care was high, though estimates were lower in studies with a high proportion of people who inject drugs. The high heterogeneity between studies made it challenging to synthesise findings. Studies should adopt a standardised definition with a three month cut-off to measure prompt linkage to care to ensure comparability. ? 2018 Croxford et al.

A major barrier is the duration and complexity of regulatory trials of new antibiotics. Extrapolation of safety data from adult trials could facilitate drug development for children. Objective: We performed a systematic review on the safety of antibiotic clinical trials (CTs) in children (0¡V18?years) to evaluate the overall quality of safety trials conducted in children and to determine if age-specific adverse events (AEs) could be identified for specific antibiotic classes. Data Sources: We searched the MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases for trials conducted between 2000 and 2016. Study Selection: All trials in which safety was declared a primary or secondary endpoint were included. Exclusion criteria were (1) topical or inhalational route of administration; (2) non-infectious conditions; (3) administration for prophylaxis rather than treatment; (4) selected population (i.e. cystic fibrosis, malignancies, HIV and tuberculosis); and (5) design other than randomized controlled trials. Trials reporting data on both adults and children were included only if paediatric results were reported separately. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two authors independently extracted the data. To assess the quality of published trials, the Extension for harms for Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement 2004 was used. Main Outcome and Measure: In order to quantitatively assess the rate of developing AEs by drug class, the numbers of overall and body-system-specific AEs were collected for each study arm, and then calculated per single drug class as median and interquartile range (IQR) of the proportions across CTs. The AEs most frequently reported were compared in the meta-analysis by selecting the CTs on the most represented drug classes. Results: Eighty-three CTs were included, accounting for 27,693 children. Overall, 69.7% of CONSORT items were fully reported. The median proportion of children with any AE was 22.5%, but did not exceed 8% in any single body system. Serious drug-related AEs and drug-related discontinuations were very rare (median 0.3 and 0.9%, respectively). Limitations included the inability to stratify by age group, particularly neonates. Conclusions and Relevance: Overall, AEs in paediatric antibiotic CTs were predictable and class-specific, and no unexpected (age-specific) side effects were identified. Smaller, open-label, dose-finding, high-quality, single-arm pharmacokinetic trials seem potentially sufficient for certain common antibiotic classes, extrapolating well-established safety profiles determined from large adult efficacy trials. This approach could reduce duration and enhance subsequent registration of urgently needed new antibiotics. This will need to be combined with enhanced methods of pharmacovigilance for monitoring of emerging AEs in routine clinical practice.. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature."

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2018,Digestive Diseases and Sciences,10.1007/s10620-017-4851-0,29282638,"Background and Aims: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided transmural drainage has been increasingly utilized as a first-line therapeutic modality for drainage of pancreatic fluid collections (PFC). Recently, lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) have been utilized for management of PFCs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the cumulative efficacy and safety of LAMS in the management of PFC (primary outcome). We also compared the efficacy and safety of LAMS with multiple plastic stents (MPS) in the management of PFC (secondary outcome). Methods: We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases from inception to November 5, 2016, to identify studies (with???10 patients) reporting technical success, clinical success, and adverse events (AE) of EUS-guided transmural drainage of PFC using LAMS. Weighted pooled rates (WPR) were calculated for technical success, clinical success and AE. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated and pooled to compare LAMS with MPS in terms of technical success, clinical success, and AE. Pooled mean difference (MD) was calculated to compare the number of endoscopic sessions required by each type of stent to achieve clinical success. All analyses were done using random effects model. Results: Eleven studies with 688 patients were included in this meta-analysis. WPR for technical success of LAMS in PFC management was 98% (96, 99%), (I2?=?15%). WPR for clinical success was 93% (89, 96%) with moderate heterogeneity (I2?=?50%). There was no difference in clinical success for pseudocysts (PP) versus walled-off pancreatic necrosis (WON) (P?=?0.51). WPR for AE was 13% (9, 20%), (I2?=?64%). AE were 10% more in WON as compared to PP (P?=?0.009). Most common AE requiring intervention was stent migration (4.2%), followed by infection (3.8%), bleeding (2.4%), and stent occlusion (1.9%). Six studies with 504 patients compared the performance of LAMS with MPS. Pooled RR for technical success was 1.71 (0.38, 7.37). Pooled RR for clinical success was 0.37 (0.20, 0.67) in favor of LAMS. Pooled RR for AE was 0.39 (0.18, 0.84), (I2?=?50%). Pooled MD for number of endoscopic sessions was ??0.84 (??1.69, 0.01). Conclusions: LAMS seem to have excellent efficacy and safety in the management of PFCs. They may be preferred over plastic stents as they are associated with better clinical success and lesser adverse events. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

However, little is known regarding the differences in neurodevelopment between young HIV+ children, HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children, and HIV-unexposed and uninfected (HUU) children. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze data on neurodevelopmental performance between young HIV+, HEU, and HUU children. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched the following electronic bibliographic databases: Ovid Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Education Resources Information Center, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected on the basis of defined inclusion criteria. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed by 2 independent reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and cross-checked by 2 additional reviewers. RESULTS: Forty-five studies were identified for inclusion in the systematic review, and of these, 11 were included in the meta-analysis on the basis of availability of Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development scores. Within the meta-analysis, when compared with their HUU peers, HIV+ and HEU children had lower cognitive and motor scores. HIV+ and HEU children with antiretroviral (ARV) exposure had lower cognitive and motor scores compared with those without ARV exposure. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to control adequately for intravenous drug use, geographic location, or quality of the assessment independently. CONCLUSIONS: Both HIV+ and HEU children had worse developmental outcomes compared with HUU children. HIV+ and HEU children with ARV exposure also had worse developmental outcomes compared with those without exposure; however, these results should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to identify the impact of ARV exposure on young children. ? 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. All rights reserved."

Measurements of antimicrobial C. difficile activity could help to identify antibiotic risk and emergent resistance. Here, we describe publication patterns relating to C. difficile susceptibilities and estimate minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for antibiotic classes in the published literature between January 1970 and June 2014. Methods: We queried PUBMED and EMBASE for studies reporting antibiotic C. difficile MIC in English or French. We used mixed-effects models to obtain pooled estimates of antibiotic class median MIC (MIC50), 90th percentile of MIC (MIC90), and MIC90:MIC50 ratio. Results: Our search identified 182 articles that met our inclusion criteria, of which 27 were retained for meta-analysis. Aminoglycosides (MIC50 120 mg/L, 95% CI 62¡V250), 3rd (MIC50 75 mg/L, 95% CI 39¡V130) and 2nd generation cephalosporins (MIC50 64 mg/L, 95% CI 27¡V140) had the least C. difficile activity. Rifamycins (MIC50 0.034 mg/L, 95% CI 0.012¡V0.099) and tetracyclines (MIC50 0.29 mg/L, 95% CI 0.054¡V1.7) had the highest level of activity. The activity of 3rd generation cephalosporins was more than three times lower than that of 1st generation agents (MIC50 19 mg/L, 95% CI 7.0¡V54). Time-trends in MIC50 were increasing for carbapenems (70% increase per 10 years) while decreasing for tetracyclines (51% decrease per 10 years). Conclusions: We found a 3500-fold variation in antibiotic C. difficile MIC50, with aminoglycosides as the least active agents and rifamycins as the most active.

We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to assess the effect on clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate between PFD and PFDD in patients with CM-1. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials.gov for retrospective or prospective studies comparing PFD with PFDD. Our main end points were clinical and imaging improvement, operative time, complications, and recurrence rate. We assessed pooled data by use of a fixed-effects or random-effects model according to the between-study heterogeneity. Results: Of 214 identified studies, 13 were eligible and were included in our analysis (N = 3481 patients). Compared with PFD, PFDD led to a mean greater increase in operative time than did PFD [standardized mean difference, ¡V2.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], (¡V2.70 to ¡V1.99)], a higher likelihood of clinical improvement in patients with syringomyelia (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.49¡V0.98), no increased RR of clinical improvement in patients without syringomyelia, no increased RR of imaging improvement, but an increased RR of cerebrospinal fluid¡Vrelated complications (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.15¡V0.58), cerebrospinal fluid leak, aseptic meningitis, pseudomeningocele, and a decreased likelihood of recurrence rate. Conclusions: PFDD can be an optimal surgical strategy because of its higher clinical improvement and lower recurrence rate in the patients with syringomyelia. In patients without syringomyelia, PFD can be a preferred choice because of its similar clinical improvement and lower costs. Future randomized studies with large numbers and the power to provide illumination for surgical decision making in CM-1 are warranted. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

It can be transmitted vertically and horizontally through contact with infected blood or body fluids. More attention to HBV infection in pregnancy is needed due to high risk of chronicity when transmitted to infants during delivery. Objectives: A comprehensive review of the HBV prevalence rate in pregnant females taking into account different geographical areas and socio-economic status is still lacking. This would be of crucial importance for HBV prevention and control programs. As such, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted focusing on HBV prevalence rate in pregnant females from different parts of the world. Methods: Different electronic databases, including Embase, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI/Web of Science were searched from January 1st 2000 to July 31st 2016, using relevant keywords, such as ¡§prevalence¡¨ or ¡§seroprevalence¡¨ or ¡§epidemiology¡¨ and ¡§pregnancy¡¨ or ¡§pregnant¡¨ or ¡§antenatal¡¨ in combination with ¡§hepatitis B virus¡¨ or ¡§HBV¡¨ with no language restrictions. The study protocol of this systematic review was deposited at the ¡§International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews¡¨ and registered as CRD42016041985. Results: After scrutinizing all the extant scholarly literature from 2000 to 2016, this study found 222 relevant articles. The overall HBV prevalence rate in pregnant females worldwide was estimated using a random-effect model, giving a value of 3% (95% confidence interval or CI 2% - 4%). Heterogeneity between studies was significantly high (I2 = 99.9%, P &lt; 0.0001). The clinical and epidemiological burden was higher in developing countries. Conclusions: This suggests that despite the recent scientific advancements and the clinical progress that has occurred in anti-viral therapy, HBV still represents a major issue worldwide, especially in underdeveloped countries. The key strategies for preventing transmission from pregnant females to their fetuses are through early birth dose and infant vaccination, as well as by the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) and the screening and diagnosis of mothers at high risk and the subsequent use of anti-viral agents during pregnancy in order to reduce maternal DNA concentrations down to undetectable concentrations. Health authorities should effectively implement these approaches to better control HBV in pregnancy. ? 2018, Hepatitis Monthly."

This systematic review aimed to identify risk factors for CRE acquisition among hospitalized patients. In addition, we summarized the environmental sources/reservoirs and the most successful infection prevention strategies related to CRE. A total of 3,983 potentially relevant articles were identified and screened. Finally, we included 162 studies in the systematic review, of which 69 studies regarding risk factors for CRE acquisition were included in the random-effects metaanalysis studies. The meta-analyses regarding risk factors for CRE acquisition showed that the use of medical devices generated the highest pooled estimate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.38 to 7.67), followed by carbapenem use (OR = 4.71; 95% CI = 3.54 to 6.26).

This systematic review aimed to assess the association between SES and GI infection risk, and explore possible sources of heterogeneity in effect estimates reported in the literature. Methods MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and grey literature were searched from 1980 to October 2015 for studies reporting an association between GI infections and SES in a representative population sample from a member-country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Harvest plots and meta-regression were used to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity such as age; level of SES variable; GI infection measurement; and predominant mode of transmission. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO: CRD42015027231. Results In total, 6021 studies were identified; 102 met the inclusion criteria. Age was identified as the only statistically significant potential effect modifier of the association between SES and GI infection risk. For children, GI infection risk was higher for those of lower SES versus high (RR 1.51, 95% CI;1.26¡V1.83), but there was no association for adults (RR 0.79, 95% CI;0.58¡V1.06). In univariate analysis, the increased risk comparing low and high SES groups was significantly higher for pathogens spread by person-to-person transmission, but lower for environmental pathogens, as compared to foodborne pathogens. Conclusions Disadvantaged children, but not adults, have greater risk of GI infection compared to their more advantaged counterparts. There was high heterogeneity and many studies were of low quality. More high quality studies are needed to investigate the association between SES and GI infection risk, and future research should stratify analyses by age and pathogen type. Gaining further insight into this relationship will help inform policies to reduce inequalities in GI illness in children. ? 2018 Adams et al.

This review examines the data on the presence/absence of viral infection in breast cancer tumors and its clinical significance. The reports on the association of breast cancer with three groups of viruses: HMTV (human Mammary Tumor Virus / MMTV-like), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) were analyzed. The authors carried out meta-analysis for each type of virus, which demonstrated the association of the viral infection with breast cancer tissue. A meta-analysis of 1389 breast cancer tissue samples and 750 normal breast tissue samples showed a high level of HMTV infection in the breast cancer tissue (30.7%). The relative risk of breast cancer associated with HMTV infection was 16.7 (95% CI: 7.0-39.7, p = 1.69x10-10). For EBV, the meta-analysis of 1131 breast tumor samples and 185 normal breast tissue samples (based on 9 primary studies) showed that the incidence of EBV infection was 30.4% in tumor breast tissue and 4.3% in normal breast tissue. The relative risk of EBV-associated breast cancer was 3.3 (95% CI: 1.8-5.8, p=0.00006). The metaanalysis of HPV infection included 29 primary studies with 2, 446 tumor tissue samples and 1, 144 normal tissue samples. The prevalence of HPV in breast cancer samples and in normal tissue samples was 25% and 4.5%, respectively. The relative risk of breast cancer associated with HPV infection was 3.6 (95% CI: 2.3-5.6, p = 2.8x10-8). The data obtained indicate that the studies on the etiological role of HMTV, EBV and HPV in the development of breast cancer are promising. ? 2018 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina. All rights reserved."

Materials and Methods: MEDLINE (1950 to January 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2017) and EMBASE (1974 to January 2017) databases were used to search for randomized controlled trials with intervening measures related to the preventive antibiotics in patients with acute stroke. Besides, the reference lists of the retrieved publications were manually searched to explore other relevant studies. Results: We included 6 randomized controlled trials involving 4110 stroke patients. The study population, study design, intervening measures, and definition of infection were different. Preventive antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of algorithm-defined infection in patients with acute stroke from 11.14% (220/1975) to 7.43% (149/2006); odds ratio (OR)=0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.87; P=0.02. There was no difference in mortality between 2 groups, the mortality in preventive antibiotics group was 17.03% (347/2037) and control group was 16.10% (328/2037); OR=1.07; 95% CI, 0.90-1.27; P=0.44. And preventive antibiotics did not improve the proportion of good outcome, the proportion of good outcome in preventive antibiotics group was 45.47% (909/1999) and control group was 45.76% (913/1995); OR=0.89; 95% CI, 0.62-1.28; P=0.53. None of the studies reported severe adverse relevant to the study antibiotics. Conclusions: Preventive antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of algorithm-defined infection in patients with acute stroke, but did not decrease the mortality or improve the proportion of good outcome. Future research should aim to identify the group of stroke patients who will benefit most from antibiotic prophylaxis. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

Surgical site infection is the most frequent complication following surgery for colorectal cancer, and the main cause of postoperative morbidity. The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the relationship between increasing BMI and postoperative surgical site infection following surgery for colorectal cancer. Methods A systemic literature search was conducted using Medline, PubMed, Embase (Ovid) and Web of Science databases from inception to the end of August 2016. Studies examining the relationship between obesity and surgical site infection following surgery for colorectal cancer were included. Analysis of the data was performed using Review Manager version 5.3(The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copen-hagen, Denmark,) Results In this meta-analysis, a total of 9535 patients from 16 studies were included. BMI &lt;30 vs ?30 kg/m2 was used to examine the association of obesity and surgical site infection in patients from Western countries. The estimated pooled OR demonstrated that obesity increased the risk of surgical site infection by approximately 100% (OR = 2.13; 95% CI 1.66-2.72, p &lt; 0.001).BMI &lt;25 vs ?25 kg/m2 was used to examine the association of obesity and surgical site infection from Asian countries. The estimated pooled OR demonstrated that obesity increased the risk of surgical site infection by approximately 60% (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.29-2.06, p &lt; 0.001). There was little evidence of publication bias in the meta-analysis. Conclusion From this systematic review and meta-analysis there was good evidence that obesity was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing surgical site infection following surgery for colorectal cancer in both ethnic groups. The magnitude of the effect warrants further investigation. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Methods Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Broncho-Vaxom for pediatric RRTI were searched using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, WanFang Data, and VIP databases up to January 2017. Risk of bias was evaluated in accordance to the guidelines of the Cochrane collaboration and the level of evidence was graded according to the GRADE. Results 53 RCTs involving 4851 pediatric patients were included in this meta-analysis. It showed that Broncho-Vaxom was positively correlated with a reduction in the frequency of respiratory infection [MD = ? 2.33, 95% CI (? 2.75, ? 1.90), P < 0.00001] compared to the control group. The Broncho-Vaxom group was more effective than control groups in relation to the duration of antibiotics course, infections, fever, cough, and wheezing, increasing serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA or IgM), and T-lymphocytes subtype (CD3 +, CD4 +, or CD8 +). However, Broncho-Vaxom had higher adverse event rates [RR = 1.39, 95% CI (1.02, 1.88), P = 0.04]; these were not serious and did not influence the treatment course. Conclusion Broncho-Vaxom shows a good efficacy for pediatric RRTIs on the basis of routine therapy (e.g. anti-infection and antiviral therapy). However, the level of evidence was low and more international multicenter clinical trials are needed to explore the efficacy and safety of Broncho-Vaxom. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

However, the results of studies on the association between CDI and PPI remain controversial. We searched the literature databases from their inception to December 2016, without restriction of language, including all controlled observational studies examining the association between acid-suppressive therapy and CDI. Pooled analysis of 50 studies showed a significant association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.12¡V1.39) as compared with non-users. When stratified by study patients, the relative risk of hospital-acquired CDI and community-associated CDI were 1.29 (1.14¡V1.44) and 1.17 (0.74¡V1.59). After restricting the studies according to hospital department, the relative risks of hospital-acquired CDI in ICUs and general wards were 1.43 (0.74¡V2.11) and 1.29 (1.13¡V1.45). By implementing cumulative meta-analysis, it was clear that earlier trials of CDI conducted in the early 2000s demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity and a high percentage of negative results. Since 2011, the overall association between PPI use and risk of developing CDI has remained relatively stable within an effect size between OR 1.20 and 1.26. Our findings indicate a significant associated risk of incident CDI among PPI users, especially in general ward patients. The totality of evidence, when using cumulative meta-analysis, showed that further trials are unlikely to overturn this positive result. Therefore establishing a guideline for the use of PPIs may help in future with the control of CDI. ? 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society"

Background: Determining true burden of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection among high-risk groups relies on knowledge of occurrence measures such as prevalence rate. There is no conclusive and comprehensive data regarding to prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups in Iran. Methods: Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge and local databases. In addition, reference lists of relevant studies were searched manually. Two independent authors reviewed the eligibility of retrieved studies and extracted the required data. Studies reporting HBV infection among high risk groups were included in the meta-analysis using random effects models. Meta regression and sub-group analysis were considered as additional analyses. Results: The initial search yielded 566 citations. After the primary screen, 37 studies were selected for review. Meta-analysis results showed that pooled prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups in Iran was 4.8% (95% confidence interval: 3.6%-6.1%), with the highest prevalence among in prisoners (5%; 3%-6%), and in central regions of Iran (7%; 4%-11%). Year of study may affect the observed heterogeneity in the estimated prevalence of HBV infection among injection drug users (IDUs) and prisoners. Conclusion: Our results indicate that prevalence of HBV infection among high risk groups was seemingly high in Iran.

Previous published studies revealed the relation of the CCR5 gene (CCR5-delta32) with the risk of HIV-1 infection, but the results are debatable and inconclusive. Here by meta-analysis, we have systematically evaluated the relation between the CCR5-delta32 polymorphism and the risk of HIV-1 infection. A comprehensive search in PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, Cochrane Library, and WanFang database was performed up to April 15, 2018. The pooled odds ratio (ORs) along with its 95% credible interval (95%CI) was used to evaluate the relation between the CCR5-delta32 polymorphism and HIV-1 infection risk. The study included 24 case-control studies involving 4,786 HIV-1 infection patients and 6,283 controls. Compared with the wild-type homozygous genotypes, the results showed that the CCR5-delta32 heterozygotes (OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.02-1.32) had an increased susceptibility to HIV-1 and the delta32 homozygous (OR=0.25, 95%CI=0.09-0.68) had significantly reduced the susceptibility to HIV-1 for healthy controls. Moreover, we have found the delta32 allele carriers (OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.54-0.94) had significantly cut down the HIV-1 infection susceptibility when using exposed uninfected (EU) as controls. We also conducted the stratified analysis by ethnicity, and there significant association was detected in Caucasian in delta32 allele carrier genotype. To summarize, our meta-analysis suggests that the CCR5-delta32 homozygous genotype (delta32/delta32) confer possible protection against HIV-1, especially the exposed uninfected groups. ? 2018 Jun Ni et al."

Data regarding its effectiveness in treating hospital-acquired infections or resistant pathogens have not been systematically compiled. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis including RCTs evaluating ceftazidime/avibactam versus comparator for the treatment of any infection. Primary outcome was 30 day all-cause mortality. Subgroups of hospital-acquired infections and specific resistance phenotypes were planned. Results: Seven publications (eight trials, 4093 patients) were included, reporting a baseline ?25% of ESBLcarrying Enterobacteriaceae. No significant difference between ceftazidime/avibactam and comparator (mostly carbapenem) was demonstrated for 30 day all-cause mortality, late follow-up mortality and clinical response [relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.70-1.72, P = 0.69; RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87-1.76, P = 0.25; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.01, P = 0.21, respectively, without significant heterogeneity]. Higher microbiological response rate was demonstrated with ceftazidime/avibactam in patients with UTI (RR 1.14, 1.0-1.29, P = 0.05, I2 = 51%). No significant difference in clinical response was demonstrated for patients with ceftazidime-resistant pathogens (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94-1.10, P = 0.66, I2 = 0%).

Conclusions: Ceftazidime/avibactam is clinically and microbiologically as effective as carbapenems for treatment of infections in a setting of ?25% ESBL-carrying Enterobacteriaceae. Safety of the drug should be further evaluated owing to a higher rate of SAEs compared with carbapenems.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2018,BioMed Research International,10.1155/2018/6278012,,"Background. Culture-negative periprosthetic joint infections (CN PJI) have not been well studied, and due to the lack of consensus on PJI, especially with culture-negative infections, there are considerable uncertainties. Due to the challenging clinical issue of CN PJI the aim of this systematic review is to describe incidence, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes based on the current literature on CN PJI. Hypothesis. The review is designed to assess the formal hypothesis that CN PJI of the hip and knee have a poorer outcome when compared with culture-positive ones. Study Design. It is systematic review with level of evidence 3. Methods. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library were searched electronically in January 2018. All studies regarding CN PJI of the hip or knee published in English or German with a minimum of 10 patients were included. Afterwards, the authors performed a descriptive analysis of diagnosis and treatment outcome. Result. Eight studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The incidence of CN PJI in the hip or knee ranged from 7% to 42 %. The included studies were pooled to give an overall incidence rate estimate of 11 % [95% confidence interval (CI): 10-12] based on a random-effects model. The most common surgical intervention was the two-stage revision of prosthesis with 283 patients. Postoperatively, the majority of patients received vancomycin as the antibiotic treatment, alone or in combination with other antibiotics. The rate of succesfully treated infections varied from 85% to 95 % in all included studies. The two-stage exchange arthroplasty had the best outcome, based on the infection-free survival rate of 95%, five years after treatment. Conclusions. We conclude that CN PJI have the same or even better results than culture-positive infections. Nonetheless, a standardized diagnostic protocol and evidence-based treatment strategies for CN PJI should be implemented for further studies. ? 2018 Marie Reisener and Carsten Perka."

Methods: We searched for studies in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Lilacs and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to March 2017. Any type of HPV infection assessed through polymerase chain reaction, subfertility factors and IVF indications and protocols were considered. Our primary outcomes were live birth/ongoing pregnancy and miscarriage, while secondary outcomes included clinical and laboratory parameters. We planned subgroup analyses according to the status of cervical cytology and presence of infection in the male partner. We assessed the relative risk (RR), using a random-effects model; heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Quality of the evidence was evaluated using the recommendations of the GRADE Working Group. Results: From the 14 studies eligible for inclusion, quantitative data from 10, evaluating 299 women with HPV infection and 2049 women without HPV infection, were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed no significant difference between HPV-infected and non-infected women in rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy (RR, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.88¡V1.53); I2 = 0%; six studies, 983 women), clinical pregnancy (RR, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.74¡V1.54); I2 = 61%; eight studies, 1173 women) or miscarriage (RR, 1.58 (95% CI, 0.93¡V2.69); I2 = 8%; six studies, 290 clinical pregnancies). The overall quality of the evidence was very low, downgraded two levels because of serious limitations of the included studies (observational studies) and imprecision. In contrast, pooled results in the subgroup analysis based on the presence of infection in the male partner showed significant differences in rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy (RR, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.23¡V0.82); I2 = 0%; three studies, 429 participants; P = 0.01) and miscarriage (RR, 3.70 (95% CI, 1.94¡V7.05); I2 = 0%; two studies, 90 participants; P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The available evidence is still inadequate to enable us to draw firm conclusions regarding the effect of HPV infection in women on the most important reproductive outcomes following IVF; however, it suggests that the effect is not large for rates of live birth/ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy. When infection is present in the male partner, it seems that there is a negative effect on live birth/ongoing pregnancy rate and an increase in miscarriage rate, a finding that should be interpreted with caution, owing to the very low quality of evidence supporting it.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to measure the diagnostic test performance of AVD flowcharts, including both World Health Organization (WHO)- and locally-adapted AVD flowcharts. Methods: A systematic search of multiple electronic databases was conducted to locate eligible studies published between 1991 and 2014. Flowcharts were categorised into one of 14 types based on: 1) use of WHO guidelines or locally-adapted versions; 2) use of risk assessment, clinical examination or both; and 3) symptomatic entry. Summary diagnostic performance measures calculated included summary sensitivity, summary specificity and diagnostic odds ratio. Results: Thirty-six studies, including data on 99 flowcharts, were included in the review. Summary sensitivity estimates for WHO flowcharts ranged from 41.2 to 43.6%, and for locally adapted flowcharts from 39.5 to 74.8%. Locally adapted flowcharts performed slightly better than the WHO flowcharts. A difference in performance was not observed between use of risk assessment or clinical examination. The AVD flowchart performed slightly better when it was not restricted to symptomatic women only. Conclusions: There was considerable variation in the performance of the AVD flowchart but overall it was a poor diagnostic tool regardless of whether risk assessment or clinical examination was included, or whether the flowchart was WHO or locally developed. Many women were treated unnecessarily and many women with cervical infection were not detected. We caution against their continued use for management of cervical infection. ? CSIRO 2018."

There was a relatively high variation in the prevalence estimates among different studies, and the Q statistics was high among articles regarding children (p<0.0001) and also between records regarding immunosuppressed patients (p<0.0001). Findings showed that the prevalence rates of Cryptosporidium infection are significantly higher in children under 5 years (P=0.00). Conclusions: In summary, the present study provides a comprehensive view of the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium in children and immunosuppressive patients in Iran. Furthermore, a multidisciplinary and multicenter study to evaluate the real prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection and to determine its risk factors using an adequate sample size and standardized methods is highly recommended. ? 2018 Babol University of Medical Sciences."

We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the mortality prediction value of presepsin in sepsis. Methods We searched comprehensive electronic databases from PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through September 2017 using the key words of (¡¥presepsin¡¦ or ¡¥sCD14-ST¡¦ or ¡¥soluble CD14 subtype¡¦) and (¡¥sepsis¡¦ or ¡¥septic shock¡¦) and (¡¥prognosis¡¦ or ¡¥prognostic value¡¦ or ¡¥prognostic biomarker¡¦ or ¡¥mortality¡¦). We extracted the presepsin levels in survivors and non-survivors from each individual study and evaluated the standardized mean difference (SMD) using a web-based meta-analysis with the R statistical analysis program. Results A total of 10 studies and 1617 patients were included. Presepsin levels in the first sampling (within 24 hours) were significantly lower among survivors as compared with non-survivors: the pooled SMD between survivors and non-survivors was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.62¡V1.22) in the random effects model (I2 = 79%, P&lt; 0.01). In subgroups, divided by the sepsis severity or study site, pooled SMD was consistently noting higher presepsin levels in non-survivals (P&lt; 0.05). Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates some mortality prediction value in presepsin in patients with sepsis. Further studies are needed to define the optimal cut-off point to predict mortality in sepsis. ? 2018 Yang et al.

The virus causes a more severe disease than mono infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The epidemiology of HDV is not well documented in North Africa, which is known to be endemic for HBV. In this study, we explored the prevalence of HDV infection and also attempted to identify factors associated with hepatitis D positive status among chronic hepatitis B patients in North Africa.Methods: The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were comprehensively searched for all papers published between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2017, using appropriate strategies containing all related keywords, including North Africa, names of countries in the region, and all permutations of hepatitis D virus. The estimated prevalence of HDV in North Africa was calculated as an average of the pooled infection prevalence in each country weighted by the ratio of the country's hepatitis D virus population to the study's sample size in the survey data analysis.Findings: A total of 312 studies were identified and 32 were included in this study, with a total sample of 4907 individuals screened for HDV. There was considerable variability in the prevalence estimates of HDV within the countries of the region. The overall prevalence of HDV in the general population of North Africa was 5¡P01% (95% CI: 1¡P25-8¡P27) and in liver disease patients it was 20.7% (95% CI:9.87-44.53). Genotype-1 was the most prominent genotype reported in five published studies. Ten studies reported on HDV RNA in participants who were seropositive for HDV, and four studies highlighted the impact of demographic factors (sex and age). No study showed the impact of risk factors on the prevalence of HDV in North Africa.Interpretation: This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the burden of HDV in Northern Africa. There were significant differences in seroprevalence, study population, and diagnostic testing between the countries in the region. The results presented here will alert health professionals to implement clear policies based on evidence to diminish the burden of HDV infection. Such measures may include but are not restricted to improving the laboratory diagnostic tests and initiating patient data registries and blood screening. Further epidemiological and research studies are needed to explore the risk factors, coinfections, and approaches to increase testing for HDV, particularly in high-risk subpopulations, such as intravenous drug users and immigrants, and to define the consequences of HDV infection in North Africa."

Grazoprevir is an NS3/4A protease inhibitor (PI), while elbasvir is an NS5A inhibitor. We performed this meta-analysis to directly compare grazoprevir plus elbasvir and ribavirin regimen vs. grazoprevir and elbasvir without ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection and to precisely evaluate the efficacy of the latter regimen in cirrhotic, IL28 CC genotype patients and those coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus. Material and methods. A computer literature search of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Embase, and Cochrane central was conducted. Studies were screened for eligibility. Sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were pooled using OpenMeta [Analyst] software for windows. A subgroup analysis was performed to stratify the treatment efficacy according to the different baseline characteristics of HCV patients. Results. Eight randomized controlled trials (n = 1,297 patients) were pooled in the final analysis. The overall SVR rate was 96.6% with 95% CI [95.5% to 98%]. For cirrhotic patients, the SVR rate was 95.7% with 95% CI [93.9% to 97.5%] and for non-cirrhotic patients, the SVR rate was 97% with 95% CI [95.9% to 98.4%]. Furthermore, the addition of ribavirin (RBV) to the treatment regimen did not significantly improve the SVR (RR 1.003, 95% CI [0.944 to 1.065]).The dual regimen was effective in patient populations with NS3 resistance-associated substitution (RAS). However, this regimen achieved lower SVR rates (< 90%) in patients with NS5A RAS. Conclusions. We conclude that the 12-week treatment regimen of the fixed dose combination of grazoprevir plus elbasvir achieved high SVR rates in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection. The addition of ribavirin to this regimen did not add a significant benefit. ? 2018, Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur. All rights reserved."

A systematic review and meta-Analysis,2018,European Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,10.1097/MEG.0000000000001057,29303883,"Background Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication among cirrhotic patients. Guidelines recommend third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) as empiric antibiotic therapy (EAT) of SBP. Recently, a broad-spectrum EAT was shown to be more effective than cephalosporins in the treatment of nosocomial spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (N-SBP); however, the prevalence of 3GCs-resistant bacteria is high in the nosocomial setting and broad-spectrum EAT cannot be used in all cases of SBP. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the 3GCs resistance distribution between N-SBP and community-Acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (CA-SBP) to clarify whether 3GCs are still an effective therapeutic intervention for CA-SBP. Methods We searched for studies that reported the aetiology of SBP and the resistance profile of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in MEDLINE and Google Scholar databases (since 1 January 2000 to 30 April 2017). A meta-Analysis was carried out to estimate the risk difference [relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for 3GCs resistance in N-SBP and CA-SBP. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2-test. Results A total of eight studies were included, including 1074 positive cultures of ascitic fluid in cirrhotic patients; 462 positive cultures were from N-SBP and, among these, 251 (54.3%) were 3GCs resistant. Six hundred and twelve positive cultures were from CA-SBP and, among these, 207 (33.8%) were 3GCs-resistant SBP. A pooled RR of 3GCs resistance in N-SBP compared with CA-SBP showed a significant difference (RR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.14-2.44; P=0.008). We carried out two subgroup analyses: the first according to the median year of study observation (before vs. since 2008) and the second according to the country of the study (China vs. others). The studies carried out before 2008 (327 SBP-positive culture) showed a significantly higher risk for 3GCs-resistant strains in N-SBP compared with CA-SBP (RR=2.36, 95% CI: 1.39-3.99; P=0.001), whereas this was not found in SBP acquired after 2008 (RR=1.24, 95% CI: 0.83-1.84; P=0.29). N-SBP occurring in China had no significantly higher risk for 3GCs-resistant strains compared with CA-SBP (RR=1.44, 95% CI: 0.87-2.37; P=0.16). Conclusion Our findings suggest that although the pooled RR of 3GCs resistance in N-SBP compared with CA-SBP show that 3GCs are still an effective option for the treatment of CA-SBP, the subanalysis of studies that enroled patients in the last decade did not show a significant higher RR of 3GCs resistance in N-SBP compared with CA-SBP. Therefore, in centres where local patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility (with low rates of 3GCs resistance) are not available, 3GCs should not be used initially for CA-SBP treatment. Future studies are needed to confirm this trend of 3GCs resistance. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

This study aimed to summarize the current scientific knowledge on modifiable risk factors for EC, by histological type, through a systematic review of meta-analyses referenced in PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. We identified 100 meta-analyses on risk factors for ESCC (n?=?54), EAC (n?=?43), or EC (n?=?51). ESCC risk significantly increased with alcohol and mat? drinking, smoking, red and processed meat consumption and human papillomavirus infection, while it was negatively associated with body mass index and consumption of fruit, vegetables, white meat, folate, and some carotenoids. Cessation of drinking and smoking significantly reduced ESCC risk. For EAC, an increased risk was reported for smoking, body mass index, and red and processed meat consumption, while risk decreased with Helicobacter pylori infection, low/moderate alcohol drinking, physical activity, and consumption of fruit, vegetables, folate, fiber, beta-carotene, and vitamin C. Differences in results between meta-analyses and mechanisms underlying some of the associations found are discussed.

Previous studies showed its sensitivity varied greatly. Its diagnostic accuracy has not been systematically evaluated yet, thus we aimed to assess its accuracy by systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Studies were searched on PubMed and Embase up to November 2017, for studies using PCR/ESI-MS to diagnose BSI directly from blood and providing sufficient data to construct two-by-two tables. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to assess heterogeneity. Results: A total of nine studies including 3,392 patients met the inclusion criteria. Their pooled sensitivity and specificity was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.57 - 0.74) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78 - 0.89), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 4.2 (95% CI: 3.0 - 5.9) and 0.40 (95% CI: 0.31 - 0.50), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 10.61 (95% CI: 6.67 - 16.88). The area under the SROC was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78 - 0.85). High heterogeneity was found. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression showed that regions, BSI prevalence, blood volume, and settings may cause heterogeneity. Conclusions: PCR-ESI/MS using blood specimens directly has the potential for early diagnosis of BSI, compared with blood culture. Its rule-in value is higher than rule-out value.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2018,Journal of Infectious Diseases,10.1093/infdis/jiy207,,"Background. The incidence of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections is increasing worldwide, particularly NTM lymphadenitis and skin infections (Buruli ulcer). This review summarizes the evidence for the protective effectiveness of BCG vaccination against NTM disease. Methods. A systematic search using PRISMA guidelines was done for controlled studies investigating the protective effectiveness of BCG vaccination against NTM disease in immunocompetent individuals. This revealed 10 studies, including almost 12 million participants. Results. Three cohort studies in industrialized countries suggest that the incidence of NTM lymphadenitis is greatly reduced among BCG-vaccinated children compared with BCG-unvaccinated children, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], .01-.21). In two randomized trials in low-income countries, BCG protected against Buruli ulcer for the first 12 months following vaccination (RR, 0.50 [95% CI, .37-.69]). Four case-control studies had conflicting results. One cohort study found that individuals with Buruli ulcer are less likely to develop osteomyelitis if they have a BCG scar (RR, 0.36 [95% CI, .22-.58]). No studies have compared different BCG vaccine strains or the effect of revaccination in this setting. Conclusions. The protective effect of BCG vaccination against NTM should be taken into consideration when deciding on recommendations for discontinuation of universal BCG vaccination programs and in assessing new vaccines designed to replace BCG. ?

The hepatitis B virus infection is a global health issue and the stage of liver fibrosis affects the prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). We performed the meta-analysis describing diagnostic accuracy of transient elastography (TE) for predicting CHB-related fibrosis. Methods. We performed an adequate literature search to identify studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of TE in CHB patients using biopsy as reference standard. Hierarchical summary receiver-operating curves model and the bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model were applied to generate summary receiver-operating characteristic curves and pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Results. The area under the summary receiver-operating curve for significant fibrosis and cirrhosis was 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.83-0.89) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of TE for significant fibrosis were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73-0.81, p&lt;0.01; I2=85.59%), 0.81 (95% CI: 0.77-0.84, p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 88.20%), and 14.44 (95% CI: 10.80-19.31, p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 100%) and for cirrhosis were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.88, p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 76.67%), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90, p&lt;0.01; I2 = 90.89%), and 36.63 (95% CI: 25.38-52.87, p &lt; 0.01; I2 = 100%), respectively. The optimal cut-off values of TE were 7.25 kPa for diagnosing significant fibrosis and 12.4 kPa for diagnosing cirrhosis, respectively. Conclusion. TE is of great value in the detection of patients with CHB-related cirrhosis but has a suboptimal accuracy in the detection of significant fibrosis. ? 2018 Xiaolong Qi et al."

The assessed parameters included clinical signs, laboratory findings, results of thoracic radiography, autopsy, histopathology, methods for the detection of Pneumocystis, as well as medical therapy. Pneumocystosis was diagnosed most often in certain breeds (Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, Miniature Dachshund) with a predisposition for impaired immunity. The median age of the dogs was 1 y. Chronic therapy-resistant respiratory signs, such as tachypnea, dyspnea, and cough, along with leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and hypogammaglobulinemia, were the most frequently described clinical and clinicopathologic abnormalities. Pneumocystosis can be masked by coinfections with other respiratory pathogens, and the successful detection of Pneumocystis organisms is of major relevance. Several detection methods have been used in the past, but only a few provide reliable results. In 2017, the cytologic evaluation of Giemsa-stained bronchoalveolar lavage samples is generally used, even if sensitivity is only moderate. More reliable results can be achieved using special stains or sensitive molecular techniques.

Aim: To assess comparative efficacy and safety of different therapies as first-line (biologic-na?ve) and second-line (prior exposure to anti-tumour necrosis factor(TNF)-£\) agents for moderate-severe UC, through a systematic review and network meta-analysis, and appraise quality of evidence (QoE) using grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Methods: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with moderate-severe UC treated with anti-TNF agents, anti-integrin agents and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, as first-line or second-line agents, and compared with placebo or another active agent. Efficacy outcomes were induction/maintenance of remission and mucosal healing; and safety outcomes were serious adverse events and infections. Network meta-analyses were performed, and ranking was assessed using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. Results: In biologic-na?ve patients (12 trials, no head-to-head comparisons), infliximab and vedolizumab were ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (infliximab: odds ratio [OR], 4.10 [95% confidence intervals [CI], 2.58-6.52]; SUCRA,0.85; vedolizumab:SUCRA,0.82) and mucosal healing (infliximab:SUCRA,0.91; vedolizumab:SUCRA,0.81) (moderate QoE). In patients with prior anti-TNF exposure (4 trials, no head-to-head comparisons), tofacitinib was ranked highest for induction of clinical remission (OR, 11.88 [2.32-60.89]; SUCRA, 0.96) and mucosal healing (moderate QoE). Differences in trial design limited comparability of trials of maintenance therapy for efficacy. Vedolizumab was ranked safest in terms of serious adverse events (SUCRA, 0.91), and infection (SUCRA, 0.75) in maintenance trials. Conclusions: Infliximab and vedolizumab are ranked highest as first-line agents, and tofacitinib is ranked highest as second-line agent, for induction of remission and mucosal healing in patients with moderate-severe UC, based on indirect comparisons. Head-to-head trials are warranted to inform clinical decision-making with greater confidence. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

We reviewed the strength of the evidence for the influence of HIV on HPV acquisition and clearance, and the influence of HPV on HIV acquisition. Methods: We performed meta-analytic systematic reviews of longitudinal studies of HPV incidence and clearance rate by HIV status (review 1) and of HIV incidence by HPV status (review 2). We pooled relative risk (RR) estimates across studies using random-effect models. I2 statistics and subgroup analyses were used to quantify heterogeneity across estimates and explore the influence of participant and study characteristics including study quality. Publication bias was examined quantitatively with funnel plots and subgroup analysis, as well as qualitatively. Results and Discussion: In review 1, 37 publications (25 independent studies) were included in the meta-analysis. HPV incidence (pooled RR?=?1.55, 95% CI: 1.29 to 1.88; heterosexual males: pooled RR?=?1.95, 95% CI: 1.62, 2.34; females: pooled RR?=?1.63, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2.11; men who have sex with men: pooled RR?=?1.36, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.82) and high-risk HPV incidence (pooled RR?=?2.20, 95% CI: 1.90 to 2.54) was approximately doubled among people living with HIV (PLHIV) whereas HPV clearance rate (pooled RR?=?0.53, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.67) was approximately halved. In review 2, 14 publications (11 independent studies) were included in the meta-analysis. HIV incidence was almost doubled (pooled RR?=?1.91, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.65) in the presence of prevalent HPV infection. There was more evidence of publication bias in review 2, and somewhat greater risk of confounding in studies included in review 1. There was some evidence that adjustment for key confounders strengthened the associations for review 2. Misclassification bias by HIV/HPV exposure status could also have biased estimates toward the null. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for synergistic HIV and HPV interactions of clinical and public health relevance. HPV vaccination may directly benefit PLHIV, and help control both HPV and HIV at the population level in high prevalence settings. Our estimates of association are useful for mathematical modelling. Although observational studies can never perfectly control for residual confounding, the evidence presented here lends further support for the presence of biological interactions between HIV and HPV that have a strong plausibility. ? 2018 The Authors.

But, some studies show that, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality among ZDV and TDF based regimens. The objective of this review was to systematically identify, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on efficacy and safety of TDF based regimen as compared to ZDV based regimens. Methods: A three-step search strategy was used to locate published and unpublished studies. First, an initial limited search of google was undertaken followed by analysis of text words. A second extensive search was undertaken. We searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, Medline, and CINHAL. We did the initial search for articles on July 11-18, 2016, and updated the results on May 13, 2017.Third, the reference lists of all identified articles was searched for additional studies. Results: ZDV based regimens had better outcome on prevention of mortality (OR=1.31, 95%CI (1.14, 1.50), I2 = 0%, Chi2 = 2.51), and lower virologic failure (OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.18, 1.76], chi2 = 5.91, P= 0.003, I2 = 83%) while, TDF based regimens were more tolerable (OR=0.15, 95%CI (0.08, 0.30), I2 = 40%, Chi2 = 3.31).

However, the comparative efficacy and safety of these treatments are controversial. Therefore, we aimed to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that compared these two treatments. Methods: A search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was carried out. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sequential with concomitant therapies were selected for meta-analysis. Results: Twenty RCTs were included in the analysis. The eradication rate of 10-day sequential therapy was superior to that of 5-day concomitant therapy (82.09 versus 77.79%, relative risk (RR) 1.052 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.004¡V1.103), P?=?0.035)), similar to that of 7-day concomitant therapy (82.40 versus 86.99%, RR 0.959 (95% CI 0.874¡V1.053), P?=?0.382), and inferior to that of 10-day concomitant therapy (78.39 versus 83.32%, RR 0.945 (95% CI 0.907¡V0.984, P?=?0.006); the occurrence of diarrhea was higher in 10-day concomitant therapy than that in 10-day sequential therapy. Compared with the eradication rate of sequential therapy, that of concomitant therapy was higher in metronidazole-resistant strains (RR 0.912 (95% CI 0.844¡V0.986, P?=?0.020)) and strains resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin (RR 0.542 (95% CI 0.308¡V0.956, P?=?0.035)). Conclusion: The efficacy of concomitant therapy was duration dependent, and 10-day concomitant therapy was superior to 10-day sequential therapy. Compared to sequential therapy, concomitant therapy was more efficacious for metronidazole-resistant strains and metronidazole plus clarithromycin-resistant strains. However, diarrhea was more frequent with concomitant therapy than with sequential therapy. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."

Despite its severity and the high incidence in the community setting, there is no consensus on the optimal duration of treatment. The aim was to compare effectiveness and tolerability of short- versus long-course treatment with the same antibiotic agent in patients with aPN. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and CENTRAL up to June 2016 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Three pairs of authors independently extracted data and appraised risk of bias. We included 4 RCTs (439 participants). Short antibiotic treatment lasted from 4 to 14 days and long treatment from 7 to 42 days but was at least 2 days longer than the corresponding short-course. At the end of treatment, we did not find any significant differences in clinical success [risk ratio (RR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.07, moderate quality evidence] as well as in microbiological success (RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92-1.07, very low-quality evidence). At 4-6 weeks after the end of treatment there were no significant differences in clinical relapses (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.43-3.30, very low-quality evidence) and re-infection of other germs (RR 2.40; 95% CI, 0.68-8.49, very low-quality evidence), even if short-term therapy seemed to have more risk of recurrences (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.19-4.83, very low quality of evidence). The incidence of any adverse effect seemed to be lower with the short-term therapy, though the results are not statistically significant (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.39-1.02, low quality evidence). Short-term treatment for aPN seems to be equivalent to long-term treatment in terms of clinical and microbiological success at the end of treatment or tolerability. The only relevant difference is the frequency of recurrence of the same biological germ up to 4-6 weeks after the end of treatment, which is significantly higher with the short-term therapy. ? 2018 Copyright F.

Traditional management of abscesses involves a linear incision through the center of the abscess with packing placed. The loop drainage technique (LDT) is an alternate approach that may reduce pain and scarring, as well as decrease the number of follow up visits needed. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the efficacy of the LDT with conventional incision and drainage (CID) in the treatment of soft tissue abscesses. Methods PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and bibliographies of selected articles were assessed for all retrospective, prospective, or randomized controlled trials comparing the LDT to CID with an outcome of treatment failure, as defined by the individual study. Data were double extracted into a predefined worksheet and quality analysis was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were summarized and a meta-analysis was performed with subgroup analyses by adult versus pediatric age groups. Results This systematic review identified four studies comprising 470 total patients. Overall, the CID technique failed in 25 of 265 cases (9.43%). The LDT failed in 8 of 195 cases (4.10%). There was an odds ratio of 2.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 6.63) in favor of higher failures in the CID group. Funnel plot analysis demonstrated no evidence of publication bias. Subgroups analysis by age group demonstrated improved efficacy of the LDT in pediatric patients, but the adult subgroup did not reach statistical significance. Discussion The existing literature suggests that LDT is associated with a lower failure rate than CID. However, the data is limited by small sample sizes and predominantly retrospective study designs. Given the potential for less pain, decreased scarring, and lower associated healthcare costs, this technique should be considered for the treatment of skin and soft tissue abscesses in the ED setting, but further studies are needed. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

A systematic search for publications on HRB among ALWHIV in SSA was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts databases. Results were summarized following PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was assessed by the DerSimonian and Laird method and the pooled estimates were computed. Prevalence of current condom nonuse behaviour was at 59.8% (95% CI: 47.9-71.3%), risky sexual partnerships at 32.9% (95% CI: 15.4-53.2%), transactional sex at 20.1% (95% CI: 9.2-33.8%), and the experience of sexual violence at 21.4% (95% CI: 16.3-27.0%) among ALWHIV. From this meta-analysis, we did not find statistically significant differences in pooled estimates of HRB prevalence between ALWHIV and HIV uninfected adolescents. However, there was mixed evidence on the occurrence of alcohol and drug use behaviour. Overall, we found that research on HRB among ALWHIV tends to focus on behaviour specific to sexual risk. With such a high burden of HRB for the individuals as well as society, these findings highlight an unmet need for age-appropriate interventions to address the behavioural needs of these adolescents. ? 2018 Derrick Ssewanyana et al."

As a result mass treatment of all children with anti-helminthic drugs particularly in school setting is being implemented. There are few studies conducted to assess impact of deworming on anemia prevalence among school children with inconclusive finding. Therefore we aimed to conduct a systematic review on impact assessment of deworming on anemia prevalence or hemoglobin level of school children so that policy makers and other stalk holders could have pooled evidence on the direction to make decision. Methods: The review was conducted through a systematic literature search of articles published between 1998 and 2015. Five bibliographic databases and libraries: PubMed/Medline, Global Health Database, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and African Index Medicus were used. After cleaning and sorting, analysis was performed using STATA version 11. The pooled estimate was through a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 and publication bias through funnel plot. Results: Eight studies were retained for final analysis which enrolled a total of 1,005,239 school children. The overall change in the hemoglobin level after deworming was 1.62(95%CI=1.01-2.25) gram/deciliter. There was no difference between the random effect model and the fixed effect model. The prevalence of anemia was markedly changed after the program, particularly in the studies which implemented deworming with hygiene program, co-administration of iron and retinol. Conclusion and Recommendation: School based deworming program decreases prevalence of anemia and will contribute to reduction of anemia in the community. Therefore the program should be expanded in all areas and integrated with other child care programs. ? 2018 Girum and Wasie."

Methods We searched the literature through October 2016 for observational studies or randomized controlled trials of adults with hepatitis C virus infection who received antiviral therapy (either direct-acting antiviral agents or interferon-based therapies), underwent liver stiffness measurement using VCTE before starting therapy, and had at least 1 follow-up VCTE after completion of therapy; studies also provided data on mean or median liver stiffness measurements for patients who did and did not achieve an SVR. We identified 24 studies, and estimated weighted mean difference (and 95% confidence interval) in liver stiffness in patients with versus without SVR using random-effects meta-analysis. Results In patients who achieved SVR, liver stiffness decreased by 2.4 kPa at the end of therapy (95% CI, ?1.7 to ?3.0), by 3.1 kPa 1¡V6 months after therapy (95% CI, ?1.6 to ?4.7), by 3.2 kPa 6¡V12 months after therapy (90% CI, ?2.6 to ?3.9), and 4.1 kPa 12 months or more after therapy (95% CI, ?3.3 to ?4.9) (median decrease, 28.2%; interquartile range, 21.8¡V34.8). In contrast, there was no significant change in liver stiffness in patients who did not achieve an SVR (at 6¡V12 months after therapy, decrease of 0.6 kPa; 95% CI, ?1.7 to 0.5). Decreases in liver stiffness were significantly greater in patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents than with interferon-based therapy (decrease of 4.5 kPa vs decrease of 2.6 kPa; P =.03), cirrhosis at baseline (decrease of 5.1 kPa vs decrease of 2.8 kPa in patients with no cirrhosis; P =.02), or high pretreatment levels of alanine aminotransferase (P <.01). Among patients with baseline liver stiffness >9.5 kPa, 47% (95% CI, 27%¡V68%) achieved posttreatment liver stiffness of <9.5 kPa. Conclusions In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we associated eradication of hepatitis C virus infection (SVR) with significant decreases in liver stiffness, particularly in patients with high baseline level of inflammation or patients who received direct-acting antiviral agents. Almost half the patients considered to have advanced fibrosis, based on VCTE, before therapy achieved posttreatment liver stiffness levels <9.5 kPa.

However, data from systematic reviews and conventional meta-analyses are limited by imprecision and restricted to direct comparisons. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to examine the safety and efficacy of drugs available for SUP in critically ill patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials through April 2017 for randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and sucralfate for SUP in critically ill patients. No date or language restrictions were applied. Data on study characteristics, methods, outcomes, and risk of bias were abstracted by two reviewers. Results: Of 96 potentially eligible studies, we included 57 trials enrolling 7293 patients. The results showed that PPIs are probably more effective for preventing clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding (CIB) than H2RAs [odds ratio (OR) 0.38; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.20, 0.73], sucralfate (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.13, 0.69), and placebo (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10, 0.60) (all moderate quality evidence). There were no convincing differences among H2RA, sucralfate, and placebo. PPIs probably increase the risk of developing pneumonia compared with H2RAs (OR 1.27; 95% CI 0.96, 1.68), sucralfate (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.20, 2.27), and placebo (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.95, 2.42) (all moderate quality). Mortality is probably similar across interventions (moderate quality). Estimates of baseline risks of bleeding varied significantly across studies, and only one study reported on Clostridium difficile infection. Definitions of pneumonia varied considerably. Most studies on sucralfate predate pneumonia prevention strategies. Conclusions: Our results provide moderate quality evidence that PPIs are the most effective agents in preventing CIB, but they may increase the risk of pneumonia. The balance of benefits and harms leaves the routine use of SUP open to question. ? 2017, The Author(s)."

The coverage failure rate was 5.24% [95%CI:3.68¡V6.81] versus 2.99% [95%CI:0.38¡V5.60] without significant difference (P = 0.016). Conclusion: In the lower limb the complications are not rare and many teams consider the free flaps to be safer. In this meta-analysis we provide evidence that failure and overall complications rate of perforator propeller flaps are comparable with free flaps. Although, partial necrosis is significantly higher for pedicled-propeller flaps than free flaps, in reality the success of coverage appears similar. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the optimal dosing of the number of nurses caring for patients remains elusive. In light of this, an updated review of the evidence on the effect of nurse staffing levels on patient outcomes is required. Aim: To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the association between nurse staffing levels and nurse-sensitive patient outcomes in acute specialist units. Methods: Nine electronic databases were searched for English articles published between 2006 and 2017. The primary outcomes were nurse-sensitive patient outcomes. Results: Of 3429 unique articles identified, 35 met the inclusion criteria. All were cross-sectional and the majority utilised large administrative databases. Higher staffing levels were associated with reduced mortality, medication errors, ulcers, restraint use, infections, pneumonia, higher aspirin use and a greater number of patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention within 90 minutes. A meta-analysis involving 175,755 patients, from six studies, admitted to the intensive care unit and/or cardiac/cardiothoracic units showed that a higher nurse staffing level decreased the risk of inhospital mortality by 14% (0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.79¡V0.94). However, the meta-analysis also showed high heterogeneity (I2=86%). Conclusion: Nurse-to-patient ratios influence many patient outcomes, most markedly inhospital mortality. More studies need to be conducted on the association of nurse-to-patient ratios with nurse-sensitive patient outcomes to offset the paucity and weaknesses of research in this area. This would provide further evidence for recommendations of optimal nurse-to-patient ratios in acute specialist units. ? 2017, ? The European Society of Cardiology 2017."

Reconstruction with allograft and synthetic mesh has been described. However, these reports have typically been small case series, and controversy exists with regard to which reconstruction technique is optimal. Methods: The authors performed a systematic review using PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews identifying 14 articles meeting inclusion criteria and producing 204 knees for comparison. Studies with repairs performed under full knee extension were included. Case reports and non-English studies were excluded. Available demographics and clinical outcome data were collected from each study. Appropriate statistical analysis was performed to compare the variables. Results: Baseline demographics and patient complexity were similar between the two cohorts. Reconstruction success rates (76% allograft vs. 74% mesh), average time to diagnosis/treatment, Knee Society Scores (KSS), knee range of motion/extensor lag, and complication rates yielded no statistical difference. Synthetic mesh was used more frequently with concomitant revision of components. Discussion: This systematic review shows equivalent success of allograft and synthetic mesh with approximately 25% failure rate in both groups. Periprosthetic joint infection remains a common and significant complication and reason for failure in both groups. Overall, synthetic mesh showed equivalent extensor mechanism reconstruction success as allograft but with much lower cost, near universal availability, lack of disease transmission, and potential for diminishing graft stretch-out. Future research in larger case series or comparative study is needed to help aid in management of this largely unsolved problem in total knee reconstruction. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) is one of the most common forms of community-acquired pneumonia in children. The objective of this study was to explore potential changes in levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-£\ (TNF-£\) and interferon-£^ (IFN-£^) associated with pediatric MPP. Methods. This protocol has been registered (PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017077979). A literature search was performed in October 2017 using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and other Chinese medical databases to identify studies. The meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3 software. Random-effect models were used to estimate mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cytokine levels. Results. Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 2,422 children with MPP and 454 healthy control children. Serum TNF-£\ levels were significantly higher in children with MPP compared with healthy children (MD = 22.5, 95% CI = 13.78-31.22, P&lt;0.00001), and there was significant heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 100%, P&lt;0.00001). Subgroup analyses showed no evidence for a difference in serum TNF-£\ levels between children with refractory and nonrefractory MPP. Serum IFN-£^ levels did not significantly differ in children with MPP compared with healthy children (MD = 4.83, 95% CI = -3.27-12.93, P=0.24). Conclusions. Our meta-analysis showed that serum TNF-£\ and IFN-£^ levels were significantly elevated and unchanged, respectively, in pediatric MPP. Because infection by different pathogens has variable effects on serum TNF-£\ and IFN-£^ levels, the finding could be helpful in developing novel diagnostic methods. ? 2018 Ying Wang et al."

We aimed to investigate the specific side effects of the available SLE drugs in this population of patients. Methods: Electronic databases were systematically searched through September 2017 for randomised trials in patients with SLE. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and withdrawal related to adverse events (AEs). We performed a random-effects network meta-analysis to obtain estimates for primary and secondary outcomes and presented these estimates as ORs with 95% CIs. Results: Forty-four studies comprising 9898 participants were included in the network meta-analysis. No drug regimen was considered to be safer for reducing all-cause mortality. However, compared with cyclophosphamide, azathioprine (OR 3.04, 95% CI (1.44 to 6.42)) and cyclosporine (OR 3.28, 95% CI (1.04 to 10.35)) were significantly less safety in AE-related withdrawals, and GC was ranked lowest and led to higher withdrawal rates. Tacrolimus (TAC) was ranked high and showed a benefit in many outcomes. Biologicals and chloroquine also showed good safety in all of the available outcomes, while the beneficial effects of other immunosuppressive drugs were not substantial in different types of serious adverse events. Conclusions: TAC is the safest strategy for patients with SLE. Biologicals and chloroquine are also fairly safe for patients with SLE. The use of other immunosuppressive drugs and GC needs to be balanced against the potential harms of different types of AEs, and the practical safety of drug combinations still requires further trials to evaluate. ? 2018 Article author(s)."

Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing early versus delayed initiation of renal replacement therapy in patients with acute kidney injury without the life-threatening acute kidney injury-related symptoms of fluid overload or metabolic disorders. Two investigators extracted the data from the selected studies. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used to assess the quality of the studies, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to test the overall quality of the evidence. Results: Six randomized controlled trials (1,292 patients) were included. There was no statistically significant difference between early and delayed initiation of renal replacement therapy regarding the primary outcome (OR 0.82; 95%CI, 0.48 - 1.42; p = 0.488), but there was an increased risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection when renal replacement therapy was initiated early (OR 1.77; 95%CI, 1.01 - 3.11; p = 0.047). The quality of evidence generated by our meta-analysis for the primary outcome was considered low due to the risk of bias of the included studies and the heterogeneity among them.

The present review was conducted to investigate the rate for resorbable versus nonresorbable membranes and the timing of soft tissue complications. Materials and Methods: Electronic and manual literature searches were conducted by two independent reviewers using several databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, for articles published through July 2015, with no language restriction. Articles were included if they were clinical trials aimed at demonstrating the incidence of soft tissue complications following GBR procedures. Results: Overall, 21 and 15 articles were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. The weighted complication rate of the overall soft tissue complications, including membrane exposure, soft tissue dehiscence, and acute infection/abscess, into the calculation was 16.8% (95% CI = 10.6% to 25.4%). When considering the complication rate based on membrane type used, resorbable membrane was associated with a weighted complication rate of 18.3% (95% CI: 10.4% to 30.4%) and nonresorbable membrane with a rate of 17.6% (95% CI: 10.0% to 29.3%). Moreover, soft tissue lesions were reported as early as 1 week and as late as 6 months based on the included studies. Conclusion: Soft tissue complications after GBR are common (16.8%). Membrane type did not appear to significantly affect the complication rate, based on the limited number of data retrieved in this study. Technique sensitivity (ie, soft tissue management) may still be regarded as the main component to avoid soft tissue complications and, hence, to influence the success of bone regenerative therapy. ? 2018 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc."

This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of interventions in improving men's uptake of and intention to undergo screening, including interventions using information and communication technology and a male-sensitive approach. Evidence acquisition Studies were sourced from five electronic databases (October 2015), experts, and references of included studies. This study included RCTs or cluster RCTs that recruited men and reported uptake of or intention to undergo screening. Two researchers independently performed study selection, appraisal, and data extraction. The interventions were grouped into those that increase uptake and those that promote informed decision making. They were further sub-analyzed according to types of intervention, male-sensitive, and web- and video-based interventions. The analysis was completed in December 2016. Evidence synthesis This review included 58 studies. Most studies were on prostate cancer (k=31) and HIV (k=11) screening. Most of the studies had low methodologic quality (79.3%) and after excluding them from the analysis, one study found that educational intervention (which was also male-sensitive) was effective in improving men's intention to screen (risk ratio=1.36, 95% CI=1.23, 1.50, k=1) and partner educational intervention increased men's screening uptake (risk ratio=1.77, 95% CI=1.48, 2.12, k=1). Video-based educational interventions reduced prostate cancer screening uptake (risk ratio=0.89, 95%CI=0.80, 0.99, k=1) but web-based interventions did not change men's screening intention or uptake. Conclusions This review highlights the need to conduct more robust studies to provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness of different interventions to improve men's screening behavior. ? 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine"

For long-term noncardiovascular safety and efficacy outcome analyses, we included only randomized controlled trials with at least 2 years and 1000 patient-years of follow-up. Five studies with 351 476 patients were included in cardiovascular outcomes analysis. Meta-analyses showed that SGLT2 inhibitors significantly reduced the risks of major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.92; P=0.002), all-cause mortality (HR: 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.84; P < 0.001), cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98; P=0.03), nonfatal myocardial infarction (HR: 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98; P=0.02), hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.62; 95% CI, 0.55-0.69; P < 0.001), and progression of albuminuria (HR: 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58-0.81; P < 0.001). No significant difference in nonfatal stroke was found. Analyses limited to randomized controlled trials showed similar findings. Trial sequential analysis provided firm evidence of a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiac events, allcause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure with SGLT2 inhibitors, but evidence remains inconclusive for cardiovascular mortality. Nine randomized controlled trials contributed to long-term noncardiovascular and efficacy analyses. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced incidence of hypoglycemia and acute kidney injury but increased the risks of urinary tract and genital infections.

Antimicrobial drug resistance is a global threat for treatment of infectious diseases and costs life and money and threatens health delivery system's effectiveness. The resistance of E. coli to frequently utilized antimicrobial drugs is becoming a major challenge in Ethiopia. However, there is no inclusive countrywide study. Therefore, this study intended to assess the prevalence of E. coli resistance and antimicrobial-specific resistance pattern among E. coli clinical isolates in Ethiopia. Methods. Articles were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and grey literature from 2007 to 2017. The main outcome measures were overall E. coli and drug-specific resistance patterns. A random-effects model was used to determine pooled prevalence with 95% confidence interval (CI), using DerSimonian and Laird method. In addition, subgroup analysis was conducted to improve the outcome. The study bias was assessed by Begg's funnel plot. This study was registered in PROSPERO as follows: PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017070106. Results. Of 164 articles retrieved, 35 articles were included. A total of 19,235 study samples participated in the studies and 2,635 E. coli strains were isolated. Overall, E. coli antibacterial resistance was 45.38% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33.50 to 57.27). The resistance pattern ranges from 62.55% in Addis Ababa to 27.51% in Tigray region. The highest resistance of E. coli reported was to ampicillin (83.81%) and amoxicillin (75.79%), whereas only 13.55% of E. coli isolates showed resistance to nitrofurantoin. Conclusion. E. coli antimicrobial resistance remains high with disparities observed among regions. The bacterium was found to be highly resistant to aminopenicillins. The finding implies the need for effective prevention strategies for the E. coli drug resistance and calls for multifaceted approaches with full involvement of all stakeholders. ? 2018 Kald Beshir Tuem et al."

Two independent reviewers selected and extracted data on ART adherence and study characteristics. Pooled estimate of adherence was derived using a random-effects model. Risk of bias in individual studies was assessed independently by two investigators using the Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS). Results and discussion: The meta-analysis included 53 studies published between 2005 and 2016, which analysed 22,603 people living with HIV in 25 Latin America and Caribbean countries. Overall adherence in Latin America and Caribbean was 70% (95% CI: 63-76; I2 = 98%), similar to levels identified by studies conducted in high-income regions. Self-report was the most frequently used method to measure adherence. Subgroup analysis showed that adherence was higher for the shortest recall time frame used, as well as in countries with lower income level, Gross National Income (GNI) per capita and Human Development Index (HDI). Studies reported diverse adherence barriers, such as alcohol and substance misuse, depression, unemployment and pill burden. Conclusions: Our study suggests that adherence to ART in Latin America and Caribbean may be below the sufficient levels required for a successful long-term viral load suppression. ? 2018 The Authors.

The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on either the skin or joints, or both, and it has a major impact on quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of the different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of conventional systemic agents (acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, methotrexate), small molecules (apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod), anti-TNF alpha (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab), anti-IL12/23 (ustekinumab), anti-IL17 (secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab), anti-IL23 (guselkumab, tildrakizumab), and other biologics (alefacept, itolizumab) for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety. Search methods: We searched the following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant RCTs. We searched the trial results databases of a number of pharmaceutical companies and handsearched the conference proceedings of a number of dermatology meetings. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of systemic and biological treatments in adults (over 18 years of age) with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis whose skin had been clinically diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriasis, at any stage of treatment, in comparison to placebo or another active agent. Data collection and analysis: Three groups of two review authors independently undertook study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses. We synthesised the data using pair-wise and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the treatments of interest and rank them according to their effectiveness (as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI) 90) and acceptability (the inverse of serious adverse effects). We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence from the NMA for the two primary outcomes, according to GRADE; we evaluated evidence as either very low, low, moderate, or high. We contacted study authors when data were unclear or missing. Main results: We included 109 studies in our review (39,882 randomised participants, 68% men, all recruited from a hospital). The overall average age was 44 years; the overall mean PASI score at baseline was 20 (range: 9.5 to 39). Most of these studies were placebo controlled (67%), 23% were head-to-head studies, and 10% were multi-armed studies with both an active comparator and placebo. We have assessed all treatments listed in the objectives (19 in total). In all, 86 trials were multicentric trials (two to 231 centres). All of the trials included in this review were limited to the induction phase (assessment at less than 24 weeks after randomisation); in fact, all trials included in the network meta-analysis were measured between 12 and 16 weeks after randomisation. We assessed the majority of studies (48/109) as being at high risk of bias; 38 were assessed as at an unclear risk, and 23, low risk. Network meta-analysis at class level showed that all of the interventions (conventional systemic agents, small molecules, and biological treatments) were significantly more effective than placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90. In terms of reaching PASI 90, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents. Small molecules were associated with a higher chance of reaching PASI 90 compared to conventional systemic agents. At drug level, in terms of reaching PASI 90, all of the anti-IL17 agents and guselkumab (an anti-IL23 drug) were significantly more effective than the anti-TNF alpha agents infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, but not certolizumab. Ustekinumab was superior to etanercept. No clear difference was shown between infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. Only one trial assessed the efficacy of infliximab in this network; thus, these results have to be interpreted with caution. Tofacitinib was significantly superior to methotrexate, and no clear difference was shown between any of the other small molecules versus conventional treatments. Network meta-analysis also showed that ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab outperformed other drugs when compared to placebo in terms of reaching PASI 90: the most effective drug was ixekizumab (risk ratio (RR) 32.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.61 to 44.60; Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) = 94.3; high-certainty evidence), followed by secukinumab (RR 26.55, 95% CI 20.32 to 34.69; SUCRA = 86.5; high-certainty evidence), brodalumab (RR 25.45, 95% CI 18.74 to 34.57; SUCRA = 84.3; moderate-certainty evidence), guselkumab (RR 21.03, 95% CI 14.56 to 30.38; SUCRA = 77; moderate-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 24.58, 95% CI 3.46 to 174.73; SUCRA = 75.7; moderate-certainty evidence), and ustekinumab (RR 19.91, 95% CI 15.11 to 26.23; SUCRA = 72.6; high-certainty evidence). We found no significant difference between all of the interventions and the placebo regarding the risk of serious adverse effects (SAEs): the relative ranking strongly suggested that methotrexate was associated with the best safety profile regarding all of the SAEs (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99; SUCRA = 90.7; moderate-certainty evidence), followed by ciclosporin (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.01 to 5.10; SUCRA = 78.2; very low-certainty evidence), certolizumab (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.10 to 2.36; SUCRA = 70.9; moderate-certainty evidence), infliximab (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.00; SUCRA = 64.4; very low-certainty evidence), alefacept (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.55; SUCRA = 62.6; low-certainty evidence), and fumaric acid esters (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.99; SUCRA = 57.7; very low-certainty evidence). Major adverse cardiac events, serious infections, or malignancies were reported in both the placebo and intervention groups. Nevertheless, the SAEs analyses were based on a very low number of events with low to very low certainty for just over half of the treatment estimates in total, moderate for the others. Thus, the results have to be considered with caution. Considering both efficacy (PASI 90 outcome) and acceptability (SAEs outcome), highly effective treatments also had more SAEs compared to the other treatments, and ustekinumab, infliximab, and certolizumab appeared to have the better trade-off between efficacy and acceptability. Regarding the other efficacy outcomes, PASI 75 and Physician Global Assessment (PGA) 0/1, the results were very similar to the results for PASI 90. Information on quality of life was often poorly reported and was absent for a third of the interventions. Authors' conclusions: Our review shows that compared to placebo, the biologics ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab are the best choices for achieving PASI 90 in people with moderate to severe psoriasis on the basis of moderate- to high-certainty evidence. At class level, the biologic treatments anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha were significantly more effective than the small molecules and the conventional systemic agents, too. This NMA evidence is limited to induction therapy (outcomes were measured between 12 to 16 weeks after randomisation) and is not sufficiently relevant for a chronic disease. Moreover, low numbers of studies were found for some of the interventions, and the young age (mean age of 44 years) and high level of disease severity (PASI 20 at baseline) may not be typical of patients seen in daily clinical practice. Another major concern is that short-term trials provide scanty and sometimes poorly reported safety data and thus do not provide useful evidence to create a reliable risk profile of treatments. Indeed, we found no significant difference in the assessed interventions and placebo in terms of SAEs. Methotrexate appeared to have the best safety profile, but as the evidence was of very low to moderate quality, we cannot be sure of the ranking. In order to provide long-term information on the safety of the treatments included in this review, it will be necessary to evaluate non-randomised studies and postmarketing reports released from regulatory agencies as well. In terms of future research, randomised trials comparing directly active agents are necessary once high-quality evidence of benefit against placebo is established, including head-to-head trials amongst and between conventional systemic and small molecules, and between biological agents (anti-IL17 versus anti-IL23, anti-IL23 versus anti-IL12/23, anti-TNF alpha versus anti-IL12/23). Future trials should also undertake systematic subgroup analyses (e.g. assessing biological-na?ve patients, baseline psoriasis severity, presence of psoriatic arthritis, etc.). Finally, outcome measure harmonisation is needed in psoriasis trials, and researchers should look at the medium- and long-term benefit and safety of the interventions and the comparative safety of different agents. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

On the other hand, viral infections of the airway are associated with the acute exacerbations of COPD. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the prevalence rate of viral infections in acute exacerbations of COPD patients. Methods PubMed database was systematically searched for population-based prevalence studies (1930¡V2017). Fixed and random effects models were used for estimation of summary effect-sizes. Between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were also calculated. ¡§Viral infections¡¨ and ¡§COPD patients with exacerbations¡¨ were the two critical inclusion criteria. Results Twenty-eight studies were selected out of 26078 articles for the present review. The overall estimation of the prevalence of viral infection was 0.374 (95% C.I: 0.359¡V0.388). Also, the evident heterogeneity of viral infection was observed among the studies (Cochran Q test, p value < 0.001 and I-squared = 97.5%). The highest and lowest prevalence rate was related to rhinovirus and echovirus, respectively. Also, the results of this study showed that the prevalence of viral infection in exacerbated COPD patients has fluctuation during the years with a slight increase and decrease. Conclusions The results of this systematic review demonstrated that respiratory viral infections have an important role in the acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). In addition, determining the exact geographic epidemiology of these viruses is very important to manage the treatment of these infections. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Data sources MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library databases were searched from inception through September 2015. Study selection Studies reporting risk factors for MRSA colonization using noncolonized controls in subspecialty level III or IV NICUs were included. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data on MRSA colonization risk factors, study design, and MRSA screening methodology. Results Eleven articles were included in the systematic review, with 10 articles analyzed via meta-analysis. MRSA colonization was associated with gestational age <32 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.27; P =.01) and birth weight <1,500 g (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.25-5.55; P =.01). Infant sex (P =.21), race (P =.06), inborn status (P =.09), and delivery type (P =.24) were not significantly associated with colonization. Conclusions Very preterm and very-low birth weight infants were identified as having an increased risk for MRSA colonization on meta-analysis.

Linezolid and teicoplanin are widely used in the treatment of infections caused by MRSA. However, the efficacy and safety of linezolid compared with teicoplanin remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of linezolid versus teicoplanin for the treatment of MRSA infections. Methodology: A meta-analysis was performed on the published studies. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to determine whether there were significant differences between the linezolid group and the teicoplanin group on the efficacy and safety. Results: Seventeen studies were included, involving 2,040 patients. The results showed that linezolid was associated with better clinical cure rate (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08-1.21, p < 0.00001) and microbiological eradication rate (RR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.18-1.39, p < 0.00001) compared with teicoplanin. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the treatment of MRSA infections regarding the adverse events (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.97-1.35, p = 0.10) and the mortality (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.61-1.18, p = 0.33). Conclusions: The results suggest that linezolid may be a better choice for the treatment of patients with MRSA infections. However, our recommendation is that the decision about treating MRSA infections with linezolid or with teicoplanin should depend on local availability, patient population, dosage regimens, costs and safety, rather than presumed differences in efficacy. ? 2017 Chen et al."

A high negative predictive value of CRP is also needed to rule out sepsis and bacterial infections in immunocompetent patients. However, few studies have evaluated the performance of CRP in immunocompromised hosts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of CRP as a marker of infection in critically immunosuppressed patients. Methods The inclusion criterion was immunosuppression for which CRP was used as a bacterial infection marker. Searches were performed in the Cochrane Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web OF Science, LILACS and CINAHL databases. We applied the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool 2 (QUADAS 2) to evaluate the quality of the articles and evaluated the test accuracy parameters using hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves and bivariate random effect models. Results Only 13 of 21 studies produced quantitative results. We analyzed all studies using the random effects method (restricted maximum likelihood) and obtained a joint diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 3.04 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.71¡V5.40) with heterogeneity (I2 = 91%, Q = 181.48, p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, a bivariate model was applied. Analyzing the tuberculosis carrier, steroid user, or presence of opportunistic infection subgroups, as described in the proposal, was not possible due to the lack of information on these topics included in the articles.

Bloodstream infection and mortality were not reduced significantly by chlorhexidine (OR 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-1.50 and OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.31-1.53, respectively). In the subgroup of surgical, mainly cardiac, patients, chlorhexidine reduced bloodstream infection (OR 0.47; 95% CI 0.22-0.97). Chlorhexidine did not affect any microorganism significantly. Conclusion In critically ill patients, oropharyngeal chlorhexidine did not reduce bloodstream infection and mortality significantly and did not affect any microorganism involved. The presence of a high risk of bias in 1 study and unclear risk of bias in others may have affected the robustness of these findings. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Methods We systematically searched studies that provide data both on sensitivity and specificity of the CMV antigenaemia assay using the PCR as the reference standard. Adults, children, infants, individuals who were immunocompromised for any reason, symptomatic patients and asymptomatic individuals were all included. A hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics model was used for diagnostic meta-analysis. Study quality was assessed by Revised Tool for the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Protocol registration identification is CRD42016035892. Results We identified 75 eligible articles including 9058 CMV PCR-positive individuals and 22 232 PCR-negative individuals. The diagnostic odds ratio for positive antigenaemia was 30 (95% CI 24¡V38, I2 = 28%) and the area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.86 (95% CI 0.83¡V0.88). The summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.65 (95% CI 0.59¡V0.70) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.93¡V0.95), respectively. The positive likelihood ratio of 10.9 (95% CI 8.5¡V14.0) suggested that a positive result from the antigenaemia assay greatly increased the probability of PCR-proven CMV infection, but a negative likelihood ratio of 0.38 (95% CI 0.32¡V0.44) indicated that a negative result led to a small decrease in the probability of PCR-proven CMV infection. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses replicated these results. Conclusions The antigenaemia assay overlooked 35% of PCR-proven CMV infections; hence, a negative result of an antigenaemia assay could not rule out a CMV infection. ? 2017"

Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy of alpha-defensin is inconsistent across published studies. Moreover, the optimum value of the diagnostic threshold urgently needs to be ascertained. This meta-analysis sought to estimate the precision of alpha-defensin for the diagnosis of PJI and, where possible, to confirm the threshold. Method: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials.gov for relevant literature on alpha-defensin in the diagnosis of PJI (searching publications from the inception of each database until February 2017, with no language restriction). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratios, and likelihood ratios were the indexes used for assessment, with the use of a random-effects model. Result: Eleven of the 426 studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of alpha-defensin in periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) were included in this analysis. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity of alpha-defensin for PJI was 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 0.99) and the specificity was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.97). Since there was substantial heterogeneity among studies, based on the inconsistency index (I2), threshold, site of arthroplasty, study design and techniques for the alpha-defensin test, subgroup analyses were performed to estimate the impacts of these variables on heterogeneity. Conclusion: In summary, this meta-analysis clearly lends support to the conclusion that alpha-defensin is a promising addition to the current methods for diagnosis of PJI. ? 2017, SICOT aisbl."

However, closure of the rectal wall defect remains a controversial point and the available literature still remains unclear. Our aim was to determine through a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of relevant studies whether or not the wall defect following TLE of rectal tumors should be closed. Methods: Medline and the Cochrane Trials Register were searched for trials published up to December 2016 comparing open versus closed management of the surgical rectal defect after TLE of rectal tumors. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.0. Results: Four studies were analyzed, yielding 489 patients (317 in the closed group and 182 in the open group). Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between the closed and open groups regarding the overall morbidity rate (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.32¡V4.91; p?=?0.74), postoperative local infection rate (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.23¡V1.62; p?=?0.33), postoperative bleeding rate (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.29¡V1.77; p?=?0.63), and postoperative reintervention rate (OR 2.21; 95% CI 0.52¡V9.47; p?=?0.29).

Objective The current meta-analysis was conducted to identify whether CHB infection plays a role in the risk of MetS and its components. Methods The electronic search of MEDLINE, PubMed Central, and EMBASE databases was systematically performed from their inception until February 2017 to identify all eligible studies. The most adjusted risk estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of chronic hepatitis B with MetS and its components were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 13 studies, with a total sample size of 138,994,999 subjects and 35,481,231 individuals with MetS were included in this Meta-analysis. The results of pooled analysis revealed that CHB infection is related to reduced risk of MetS (OR = 0.83, 95%CI = 0.71¡V0.79, random effects), with evidence of significant heterogeneity (I2 = 89%, P < 0.001). This association was an age, gender, and ethnicity-dependent relationship. Moreover, CHB was associated with reduced risk of elevated blood pressure, reduced HDL-cholesterol, increased fasting glucose, and, most strongly with increased triglycerides in some subgroups. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of the results.

Several studies evaluating the efficacy of rifaximin for SBP prophylaxis have yielded conflicting results. Rifaximin has the potential advantage of preventing bacterial overgrowth and translocation without the systemic side effects of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of rifaximin in the primary and secondary prevention of SBP. Methods: A literature search using five databases was performed to identify studies on the association between rifaximin and SBP. We performed two meta-analyses: (1) rifaximin compared to systemic antibiotics and (2) rifaximin compared to no antibiotics. Random-effect modelling was conducted to determine overall pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Five studies with 555 patients (295 rifaximin, 260 systemic antibiotics) compared rifaximin with systemic antibiotics. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for SBP was 0.45 (95% CI 0.16-1.27; P =.13) in patients receiving rifaximin and strengthened on sensitivity analysis (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.76, P =.01). In the analysis comparing rifaximin with no antibiotics, there were five studies with 784 patients (186 rifaximin, 598 no antibiotics). The OR for SBP was 0.34 (95% CI 0.11-0.99; P <.05) in patients receiving rifaximin. In subgroup analysis, rifaximin reduced the risk of SBP by 47% compared to no antibiotics for primary prophylaxis and by 74% compared to systemic antibiotics for secondary prophylaxis.

Cockroaches have been proved vectors of medically fungi. Methods A systematic meta-analysis review about cockroach fungal contamination was investigated. Relevant topics were collected between January 2016 and January 2017. After a preliminary review among 392 collected papers, 156 were selected to become part of the detailed systematic meta-analysis review. Results Cockroaches contaminated to 38 fungi species belonging to 19 families and 12 orders. About 38, 25 and 13 fungal species were recovered from the American, German and brown-banded cockroaches, respectively with a variety of medical importance. Except the fungi isolated from German and brown-banded cockroaches, 15 species have been isolated only from the American cockroaches. The global world mean and trend of cockroach fungal contamination were 84.1 and 50.6¡V100%, respectively in the human dwelling environments. There is a significant difference between cockroach fungal contamination in the urban and rural environments (P < 0.05) without a significant difference between hospital and household environments (P > 0.05). The external and internal cockroach fungal contamination is more dangerous than entire surfaces, while the internal is more dangerous than the external surface. The German and brown-banded cockroach fungal contamination are more dangerous than the American cockroaches in the hospital environments. Conclusion The study indicates that globally cockroach fungal contamination has been increased recognizing as agents of human infections and associating with high morbidity and mortality in immune-compromised patients. These facts, along with insecticide resistance emergence and increasing globally cockroach infestation, reveal importance of cockroaches and need for their control more than ever. ? 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"

Triclosan-coated sutures are recommended to reduce SSI. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing the rate of SSI in abdominal surgery when using triclosan-coated or uncoated sutures for fascial closure. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science including publications until August 2017. The quality of the RCTs was evaluated using critical appraisal checklists from SIGN. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analysis were performed with Review Manager v5.3 and TSA software, respectively. Results: Eight RCTs on abdominal wall closure were included in the meta-analysis. In an overall comparison including both triclosan-coated Vicryl and PDS sutures for fascial closure, triclosan-coated sutures were superior in reducing the rate of SSI (OR 0.67; 0.46¡V0.98). When evaluating PDS sutures separately, there was no effect of triclosan-coating on the rate of SSI (OR 0.85; 0.61¡V1.17). Trial sequential analysis showed that the required information?size (RIS) of 797 patients for triclosan-coated Vicryl sutures was almost reached with an accrued information size (AIS) of 795 patients. For triclosan-coated PDS sutures an AIS of 2707 patients was obtained, but the RIS was estimated to be 18,693 patients. Conclusion: Triclosan-coated Vicryl sutures for abdominal fascial closure decrease the risk of SSI significantly and based on the trial sequential analysis further RCTs will not change that outcome. There was no effect on SSI rate with the use of triclosan-coated PDS sutures for abdominal fascial closure, and it is unknown whether additional RCTs will change that. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag France SAS."

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Database from inception to 6 January 2016 to identify studies evaluating risk factors and clinical prediction rules for IE in SAB patients. Pooled estimates of diagnostic properties for main risk factors were calculated using a bivariate random effects model. Results Of 962 articles identified, 30 studies were included. These involved 16 538 SAB patients including 1572 IE cases. Risk factors with positive likelihood ratio (PLR) greater than 5 included embolic events (PLR 12.7, 95% CI 9.2¡V17.7), pacemakers (PLR 9.7, 95% CI 3.7¡V21.2), history of previous IE (PLR 8.2, 95% CI 3.1¡V22.0), prosthetic valves (PLR 5.7, 95% CI 3.2¡V9.5), and intravenous drug use (PLR 5.2, 95% CI 3.8¡V6.9). The only clinical factor with negative likelihood ratio (NLR) less than 0.5 was documented clearance of bacteraemia within 72 hours (NLR range 0.32¡V0.35). Of the nine published clinical prediction rules for ruling out IE, five had an NLR below 0.1. Conclusions SAB patients with high-risk features (embolic events, pacemakers, prosthetic valves, previous IE, or intravenous drug use) should undergo a trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) for IE. Clinical prediction rules show promise in safely ruling out endocarditis, but require validation in future studies. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

If displaced or unstable they may require surgical reduction and fixation with Kirschner wires (K-wires). K-wires are placed using either an open or closed technique. The decision to bury or leave the ends extending through the skin is surgeon-dependent and based on factors including post-operative infection risk, bony union and ease of wire removal. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-buried versus buried K-wires for lateral condyle elbow fractures in children in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. A comprehensive search strategy included Medline, Embase and CINAHL via NICE Evidence from database inception to June 2017. Two authors independently reviewed, included or excluded articles, extracted data and assessed for quality with the ROBINS-I tool. We performed direct comparison meta-analysis for all adverse events, post-operative infection and failure of bony union. Results Three studies were analysed comprising of 434 participants. There was a significantly reduced relative risk of adverse events in the non-buried group, equating to approximately 45% reduced risk (RR 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.88). There were no significant differences in risk of post-operative infection or failure of bony union. All three cost-analyses in the included studies observed savings with non-buried K-wires. Conclusion Non-buried K-wires for lateral condyle elbow fractures convey a lower risk of adverse events and may be more cost-effective compared with buried K-wires. Non-buried K-wires do not appear to increase the risk of infection or failure of bony union. These findings are limited by a high risk of bias due to inherent methodological flaws in the design of included studies. ? 2017, British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery.

The risk of perioperative continuation of aspirin in neurosurgery needed to be evaluated. Purpose This study aimed to evaluate all available evidence about continuation of aspirin and to compare peri- and postoperative blood loss and complication rates between patients that continued aspirin and those who discontinued aspirin perioperatively in spinal surgery. Study Setting Systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. Method A meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies comparing aspirin continuation with discontinuation were included. Studies using a combination of anticlotting agents or non-spinal procedures were excluded. Operative outcomes (blood loss and operative length) and different complications (surgical site infection [SSI]), stroke, myocardial infarction within 30 days postoperatively) were extracted. Overall prevalence and means were calculated for the reported outcomes in fixed-effects models with heterogeneity (I-squared [I2]) and effect modification (P-interaction) assessment. Results Out of 1,339 studies, three case series were included in the meta-analysis. No significant differences in mean operating time were seen between the aspirin-continuing group (mean=201.8 minutes, 95% confidence interval [CI]=193.3; 210.3; I2=95.4%; 170 patients) and the aspirin-discontinuing group (mean=178.4 minutes, 95% CI=119.1; 237.6; I2=93.5%; 200 patients); (P-interaction=0.78).

One-fifth of these patients have blood transfusions during their hospital stay. Increases in transfusion rates have caused concern about increased adverse events from unnecessary transfusions. Methods We systematically reviewed randomized trials examining the effect of restrictive vs liberal transfusion thresholds on patients having major orthopedic surgery. Study results were meta-analyzed with a random-effects model and heterogeneity was tested with the I2 statistic. Study risk of bias was assessed using a modified Jadad scale and evidence strength was measured using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system. Results A total of 504 published articles were screened, and 15 met inclusion criteria. The articles described 9 randomized trials, most comparing transfusion thresholds of 8 vs 10 g/dL hemoglobin. All involved hip or knee arthroplasty and/or hip fracture patients. Moderate-strength evidence suggested a reduction in need for transfusion (relative risk, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.71; I2 = 95%) and mean number of units transfused (?0.95 units, 95% CI, ¡V1.48 to ?0.41, I2 = 98%). There was a possible reduction in overall infections with more restrictive transfusion thresholds, although the result was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.06; I2 = 54%). Moderate-strength evidence suggested no differences in other clinical outcomes between the groups. Limitations included incomplete blinding, inconsistency, and imprecision. Conclusion Moderate-strength evidence suggests that restrictive transfusion practices reduce utilization of transfusions and may decrease infections without increasing adverse outcomes in major orthopedic surgery. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

The aim of this study was to analyze the published literature on the clinical and economic implications of ABR in developing countries. Methods A systematic search was carried out in Medline via PubMed and Web of Sciences and included studies published from January 01, 2000 to December 09, 2016. All papers were considered and a quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS). Results Of 27 033 papers identified, 40 studies met the strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and were finally included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Mortality was associated with resistant bacteria, and statistical significance was evident with an odds ratio (OR) 2.828 (95%CI, 2.231¡V3.584; p = 0.000). ESKAPE pathogens was associated with the highest risk of mortality and with high statistical significance (OR 3.217; 95%CIs; 2.395¡V4.321; p = 0.001). Eight studies showed that ABR, and especially antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE bacteria significantly increased health care costs. Conclusion ABR is associated with a high mortality risk and increased economic costs with ESKAPE pathogens implicated as the main cause of increased mortality. Patients with non-communicable disease co-morbidities were identified as high-risk populations. ? 2017 Founou et al.

The synergy rate was defined as the primary outcome that was calculated separately for time-kill, Etest, and checkerboard microdilution methods. The secondary outcomes were bactericidal activity and the efficacy of combination treatment on the development of resistance. In total, 37 published papers and 16 conference proceedings were included. Nine classes consisting of 22 antibiotic types in combination with tigecycline against 1,159 A. baumannii strains were reported in the analysis. For the time-kill studies, combination therapy showed a synergy rate of 37.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.7-46.5); the highest synergy rate was 67.4% (95% CI, 27.3-91.9) for tigecycline in combination with colistin. Moreover, combination with amikacin or colistin could efficiently inhibit the development of tigecycline resistance. Compared with checkerboard microdilution and Etest methods, time-kill studies always showed higher synergy rates. Altogether, these results suggest that the in vitro tigecycline-based combinations resulted in moderate synergy rates and that several combinations could suppress the resistance of A. baumannii to tigecycline, which should be further confirmed in animal models and clinical trials. ?

However, some argue that an alternative approach of infiltrating local anaesthetic into the surgical site has similar efficacy. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to compare the analgesic and functional outcomes of both treatments following anterior ligament reconstruction. The primary outcomes were pain scores at rest (analogue scale, 0¡V10) in the early (0¡V2 postoperative hours), intermediate (3¡V12 hours) and late postoperative periods (13¡V24 hours). Secondary outcomes included range of motion, quadriceps muscle strength and complication rates (neurological problems, cardiovascular events, falls and knee infections). Eleven trials, including 628 patients, were identified. Pain scores in the early, intermediate and late postoperative periods were significantly lower in patients who received a femoral nerve block, with mean differences (95%CI) of 1.6 (0.2¡V2.9), p?=?0.02; 1.2 (0.4¡V1.5), p?=?0.002; and 0.7 (0.1¡V1.4), p?=?0.03 respectively. The quality of evidence for our primary outcomes was moderate to high. Regarding functional outcomes, only one trial reported a similar range of motion between groups at 48 postoperative hours. No trial sought to record complications. In conclusion, femoral nerve block provides superior postoperative analgesia after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction to local infiltration analgesia. The impact of improved analgesia on function remains unclear due to the lack of reporting of functional outcomes in the existing literature. ? 2017 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland"

To examine whether the more recently published meta-analyses and trials would change past conclusions, we systematically reviewed meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation and non-skeletal disorders published between Jan 1, 2013, and May 31, 2017, that included study participants of all ages, including pregnant women. We also searched for randomised trials not included in meta-analyses. We identified 87 meta-analyses, of which 52 were excluded because they contained less recent literature or were of suboptimal quality. We retrieved 202 articles on trials that were not included in meta-analyses. Recent meta-analyses reinforce the finding that 10¡V20 £gg per day of vitamin D can reduce all-cause mortality and cancer mortality in middle-aged and older people. Although vitamin D doses were greater than those assessed in the past, we found no new evidence that supplementation could have an effect on most non-skeletal conditions, including cardiovascular disease, adiposity, glucose metabolism, mood disorders, muscular function, tuberculosis, and colorectal adenomas, or on maternal and perinatal conditions. New data on cancer outcomes were scarce. The compilation of results from 83 trials showed that vitamin D supplementation had no significant effect on biomarkers of systemic inflammation. The main new finding highlighted by this systematic review is that vitamin D supplementation might help to prevent common upper respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations. There remains little evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplementation has an effect on most conditions, including chronic inflammation, despite use of increased doses of vitamin D, strengthening the hypothesis that low vitamin D status is a consequence of ill health, rather than its cause. We further hypothesise that vitamin D supplementation could exert immunomodulatory effects that strengthen resistance to acute infections, which would reduce the risk of death in debilitated individuals. We identified many meta-analyses of suboptimal quality, which is of concern. Future systematic reviews on vitamin D should be based on data sharing so that data for participants with the same outcomes measured in the same way can be pooled to generate stronger evidence. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards. The review protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (Registration Number: CRD42016052131). We conducted a search of electronic information sources, including MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; and ISRCTN Register, and bibliographic reference lists to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing outcomes of laparoscopic repair to open repair of umbilical and paraumbilical hernias. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Newcastle¡VOttawa scale to assess the risk of bias of RCTs and observational studies, respectively. Random effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Results: We identified three RCTs and seven retrospective cohort studies, enrolling a total of 16,549 patients. Our analyses indicated that open repair was associated with a higher risk of wound infection [Odds ratio (OR) 2.35, 95% CI 1.23¡V4.48, P?=?0.010], wound dehiscence (OR 4.99, 95% CI 1.12¡V22.28, P?=?0.04) and recurrence (OR 4.06, 95% CI 1.54¡V10.71, P?=?0.005), longer length of hospital stay (MD 26.85, 95% CI 8.15¡V45.55, P?=?0.005) and shorter operative time [Mean difference (MD) ??23.07, 95% CI ??36.78 to ??9.35, P?=?0.0010] compared to laparoscopic repair. There was no difference in the risk of haematoma (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.22¡V18.73, P?=?0.53) or seroma (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.19¡V2.32, P?=?0.53) between the two groups. Conclusions: The best available evidence (randomised and non-randomised studies) suggests that laparoscopic repair of umbilical or paraumbilical hernias may be associated with a lower risk of wound infection, wound dehiscence and recurrence rate, shorter length of stay but longer operative time. Results from a limited number of RCTs showed no difference in recurrence rates. The quality of the best available evidence is moderate, and selection bias is the major concern due to non-randomised design in most of the available studies. Therefore, considering the level of available evidence, the most reliable approach for repair of umbilical or paraumbilical hernia should be based on surgeon¡¦s experience, clinical setting, patient¡¦s age and size, hernia defect size and anatomical characteristics.

Safety and feasibility remain controversial when comparing MIPD with open pancreaticoduodenectomy (OPD). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of MIPD versus OPD. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify studies comparing MIPD and OPD. Postoperative complications, intraoperative outcomes and oncologic data, and postoperative recovery were compared. Results: There were 27 studies that matched the selection criteria. Totally 1306 cases of MIPD and 5603 cases of OPD were included. MIPD was associated with a reduction in postoperative hemorrhage (odds ratio [OR] 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-2.49; P=.04) and wound infection (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.30-0.66, P<.0001). MIPD was also associated with less estimated blood loss (mean difference [MD] -300.14 mL, 95% CI -400.11 to -200.17 mL, P<.00001), a lower transfusion rate (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.61; P<.00001) and a shorter length of hospital stay (MD -2.95 d, 95% CI -3.91 to -2.00 d, P<.00001) than OPD. Meanwhile, the MIPD group had a higher R0 resection rate (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.18-1.78, P=.0003) and more lymph nodes harvested (MD 1.34, 95% CI 0.14-2.53, P=.03). However, the minimally invasive approach proved to have much longer operative time (MD 71.00 minutes; 95% CI 27.01-115.00minutes; P=.002) than OPD. Finally, there were no significant differences between the 2 procedures in postoperative pancreatic fistula (P=.30), delayed gastric emptying (P=.07), bile leakage (P=.98), mortality (P=.88), tumor size (P=.15), vascular resection (P=.68), or reoperation rate (P=.11). Conclusions: Our results suggest that MIPD is currently safe, feasible, and worthwhile. Future large-volume, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCT) with extensive follow-up are awaited to further clarify this role. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

Object: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness of operative and nonoperative treatments in treating patients with DIACF. Methods: Databases including Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CBM, CNKI, and Google Scholar were searched. After independent study selection by 2 authors, data were extracted and collected independently. Comparisons were performed between operative treatment group and nonoperative treatment group. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RevMan 5.3 was used for data analysis. The primary outcome measures were anatomical measures (changes in B?hler angle and calcaneal height and width), functional measures (shoe problems, resuming preinjury work, and residual pain), and complications (including superficial and deep wound infection, skin flap necrosis, neurovascular injury, secondary arthrodesis, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, osteotomy, thromboembolism, and compartment syndromes). Results: Eighteen trials (8 randomized controlled trials and 10 controlled clinical trials) including 1467 patients were considered. For anatomical measurements, the overall mean differences (MDS) for the mean B?hler angle, calcaneal height and width were 15.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.12-21.67), 6.55 (95% CI 2.67-10.43), and 7.05 (95% CI -7.83 to -6.27), respectively. In functional measures, the overall effect MD of American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society was 6.23 (95% CI 5.22-17.67) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.22-0.67). The overall relative risks (RRs) of wearing shoes, resuming preinjury work, and having residual pain were 0.32 (95% CI 0.32-1.00), 0.56 (95% CI 0.40-0.77), and 0.90 (95% CI 0.68-1.20), respectively. The overall RR of the incidence of complications was 2.00 (95% CI 1.51-2.64).

Methods Embase?, PubMed? and CINAHL databases were systematically searched for studies published between January 2000 and August 2017 that reported the prevalence of occupational exposure to blood or other body fluids among health-care workers in Africa. The continent-wide prevalence of exposure was estimated using random-effects meta-analysis. Findings Of the 904 articles identified, 65 studies from 21 African countries were included. The estimated pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence of occupational exposure to body fluids were 65.7% (95% confidence interval, CI: 59.7-71.6) and 48.0% (95% CI: 40.7-55.3), respectively. Exposure was largely due to percutaneous injury, which had an estimated 12-month prevalence of 36.0% (95% CI: 31.2-40.8). The pooled 12-month prevalence of occupational exposure among medical doctors (excluding surgeons), nurses (including midwives and nursing assistants) and laboratory staff (including laboratory technicians) was 46.6% (95% CI: 33.5-59.7), 44.6% (95% CI: 34.1-55.0) and 34.3% (95% CI: 21.8-46.7), respectively. The risk of exposure was higher among health-care workers with no training on infection prevention and those who worked more than 40 hours per week. Conclusion The evidence available suggests that almost one half of health-care workers in Africa were occupationally exposed to body fluids annually. However, a lack of data from some countries was a major limitation. National governments and health-care institutions across Africa should prioritize efforts to minimize occupational exposure among health-care workers. ? 2017, World Health Organization.

The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate short- and long-term oncological outcomes after laparoscopic surgery for T4 colon cancer, and to compare these with open surgery. Methods: Using systematic review of literature, studies reporting on radicality of resection, disease-free survival (DFS), and/or overall survival (OS) after laparoscopic surgery for T4 colon cancer were identified, with or without a control group of open surgery. Pooled proportions and risk ratios were calculated using an inverse variance method. Results: Thirteen observational cohort studies published between 2012 and 2017 were included, together consisting of 1217 patients that received laparoscopic surgery and 1357 with an open procedure. The proportion of multivisceral resections was larger in the open group in five studies. Based on 11 studies, the pooled proportion of R0 resection was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.91¡V0.99) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.90¡V0.98) after laparoscopic and open surgery, respectively. Analysing (mainly) T4a subgroups in 6 evaluable studies revealed pooled R0 resection rates of 0.94 in both groups. No significant differences were found between laparoscopic and open surgery for any survival measure: RR 1.07 (95% CI: 0.96¡V1.20) for 3-year DFS, RR 1.04 (95% CI: 0.95¡V1.15) for 5-year DFS, RR 1.07 (95% CI: 0.99¡V1.14) for 3-year OS, and RR 1.05 (95% CI: 0.98¡V1.12) for 5-year OS. Conclusion: Literature on laparoscopic surgery for T4 colon cancer is restricted to non-randomized comparisons with substantial allocation bias. Laparoscopic surgery for T4a tumours might be safe, whereas for T4b colon cancer requiring multivisceral resection it should be applied with caution. ? 2017, The Author(s)."

However, uncertainties surround the sensitivity and specificity of DBS for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) serology testing. We aimed to evaluate the accuracy of DBS use to screen for HCV infection. Study design We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Medline and EMBASE databases were searched for articles published between 1989 and November 2016. We included studies comparing DBS to plasma/serum specimens to detect anti-HCV in adults. Two authors extracted data and assessed the quality of the studies using an adapted standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) and independently checked the data for accuracy. Meta-analysis was computed with the bivariate and the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic models. Results Twelve studies (3307 specimens) were analyzed, where 11 of them evaluated the anti-HCV using enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), and the remaining one used rapid diagnostic tests. The studies were mostly case-controls (83.3%) and from developed countries (66.7%). The overall pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval; CI) and specificity (95% CI) of DBS to detect anti-HCV was 98.1% (96.1¡V99.1%) and 99.7% (98.9¡V99.9%), respectively. In studies using EIAs, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% (94.3¡V98.8%) and 99.6% (98.5¡V99.9%), respectively. Considering only studies using EIAs, sensitivity analysis excluding one study carried out in people who inject drugs showed the pooled sensitivity of 97.8% (96.2¡V98.8%) and specificity of 99.5% (98.5¡V99.9%). Conclusions In testing for anti-HCV by means of EIAs, the efficacy of DBS is found to be similar or slightly lower than that of serum specimens. However, the risk of finding negative and positive results that are both false when using DBS remains present. Therefore, further work including optimal storage and processing methodologies are recommended. This is to help establish consensus guidelines for use of DBS specimens for anti-HCV screening. ? 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health"

A threshold of 7?g/dL for stabilized patients with sepsis is commonly proposed, although debated. The aim of the study was to compare the benefit and harm of restrictive versus liberal RBCT strategies in order to guide physicians on RBCT strategies in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Four outcomes were assessed: death, nosocomial infection (NI), acute lung injury (ALI) and acute kidney injury (AKI). Studies assessing RBCT strategies or RBCT impact on outcome and including intensive care unit (ICU) patients with sepsis were assessed. Two systematic reviews were achieved: first for the randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and second for the observational studies. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Clinical Trials.gov were analyzed up to March 01, 2015. Der Simonian and Laird random-effects models were used to report pooled odds ratios (ORs). Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to explore studies heterogeneity. One RCT was finally included. The restrictive RBCT strategy was not associated with harm or benefit compared to liberal strategy. Twelve cohort studies were included, of which nine focused on mortality rate. RBCT was not associated with increased mortality rate (overall pooled OR was 1.10 [0.75, 1.60]; I2?=?57%, p?=?0.03), but was associated with the occurrence of NI (2 studies: pooled OR 1.25 [1.04¡V1.50]; I2?=?0%, p?=?0.97), the occurrence of ALI (1 study: OR 2.75 [1.22¡V6.37]; p?=?0.016) and the occurrence of AKI (1 study: OR 5.22 [2.1¡V15.8]; p?=?0.001). Because there was only one RCT, the final meta-analyses were only based on the cohort studies. As a result, the safety of a RBCT restrictive strategy was confirmed, although only one study specifically focused on ICU patients with sepsis.

However, the efficacy and safety of VPZ vs proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) in H. pylori eradication therapies remain controversial. Objective: To perform a meta-analysis in order to assess the efficacy and safety of VPZ vs PPI for H. pylori eradication. Materials and Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to July 10, 2017, for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized clinical studies (NRCTs). The pooled eradication rate (ER) and pooled occurrence rates of adverse events were used to compare the efficacy and safety of VPZ - and PPI-containing regimens. Result: A total of 14 studies with 14?636 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the pooled ER of VPZ -containing regimens was much higher than that of PPI-containing regimens when used as first-line therapies. This difference was significant for both intention-to-treat (85.1% vs 68.0%, P?<.00001) and per-protocol analyses (89.0% vs 74.2%, P?<.00001). Moreover, subgroup analysis indicated significant superiority of VPZ in both patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains (81.5% vs 40.9%, P?<.00001) and those with clarithromycin-susceptible strains (94.9% vs 89.6%, P?=.006). However, VPZ did not show superiority to PPI as part of a second-line triple therapy based on both intention-to-treat (83.4% vs 82.0%, P?=.79) and per-protocol analyses (89.3% vs 90.1%, P?=.06). Finally, RCT subgroup analysis showed the safety of VPZ -containing regimens to be better than PPI-containing regimens (26.4% vs 33.3%, P?=.008), whereas there was no significant difference in this regard for the NRCT subgroup analysis (5.7% vs 4.7%, P?=.08). Conclusions: The efficacy of VPZ is superior to PPI in first-line H. pylori triple eradication therapies but not in second-line therapies. The safety of VPZ -containing regimens appears to be equal or even superior to that of PPI. However, most reports included in this study had low levels of evidence. Hence, adequate and high-quality RCTs will be needed to support our results. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Surveys in the United States and Europe have shown a plateau of new HIV cases, with certain regions and populations disproportionately affected by the disease. Ethnic minority women and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected by HIV. Previous reviews have focused on prevention interventions targeting ethnic minority men who have sex with men, have not accounted for socioeconomic status, or have included only interventions carried out in clinical settings. Objectives. To review and assess the effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged ethnic minority women in member states of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Search Methods. On March 31, 2014, we executed a search using a strategy designed for the MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge databases. Additional searches were conducted through the Cochrane Library, CRD Databases, metaRegister of Controlled Trials, EURONHEED, CEA Registry, and the European Action Program for Health Inequities as well as in gray literature sources. No language or date restrictions were applied. Selection Criteria. We selected studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions to prevent HIV among ethnic minority women of low socioeconomic status in which at least 80% of participants were reported to belong to an ethnic minority group and to have a low income or be unemployed. We included only studies that were conducted in OECD member states and were randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental investigations with a comparison group. Data Collection and Analysis. A data extraction form was developed for the review and used to collect relevant information from each study. We summarized results both qualitatively and quantitatively. The main outcomes were categorized into 3 groups: improved knowledge regarding transmission of HIV, behavior changes related to HIV transmission, and reductions in the incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We then performed meta-analyses to assess the effectiveness of the prevention interventions in terms of the 3 outcome categories. Main Results. A total of 43 interventions were included, and 31 were judged to be effective, 7 were partially effective, and 5 were ineffective. The most frequently recurring characteristics of these interventions were cultural adaptation, a cognitive¡Vbehavioral approach, the use of small groups and trained facilitators, and a program duration of between 1 and 6 weeks. Our meta-analyses showed that the interventions improved knowledge of HIV transmission (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.43, 0.75), increased the frequency of condom use (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.16, 2.19), and significantly reduced the risk of STI transmission by 41% (relative risk = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.46, 0.75). Conclusions. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of HIV prevention interventions targeting socioeconomically deprived ethnic minority women. Public Health Implications. This is one of the first studies to include a meta-analysis assessing reductions in STI incidence among at-risk women who have participated in HIV prevention programs. The fact that our meta-analyses showed a statistically significant reduction in STI transmission provides important evidence supporting the overall effectiveness of directing prevention programming toward this vulnerable population. For policymakers, this review demonstrates the feasibility of working with multiple intervention components while at the same time facilitating more effective interventions that take into account the principal outcome measures of knowledge, behavior change, and STI transmission rates. The review also underscores the need for additional research outside the United States on the effectiveness of prevention interventions in this vulnerable group."

Methods: PubMed, clinictrials.gov.uk, and the Cochrane database were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing closure of the abdomen after laparotomy using a prophylactic mesh with suture closure. A meta-analysis was then performed. The primary outcome was the occurrence of IH. Results: Eight studies were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis with a total of 727 patients. Primary outcome: There was a significant reduction in the occurrence of IH in the mesh group vs. the suture repair group, OR 0.14 (95% CI 0.07¡V0.27). Secondary outcomes: There was a significant increase in the number of seromas in the mesh group vs. the suture repair group, OR 1.73 (95% CI 1.04¡V2.87).

Methods: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare all available formulations: conventional AB; lipid complex or ABLC; colloidal dispersion or ABCD; liposomal or LAB; AB in Intralipid. Randomized controlled trials were searched in four databases. Cure, fever, chills, nephrotoxicity, death and drug discontinuation were assessed. NMA was based on Bayesian methods accounting for direct and indirect comparisons. Probability ranks estimating the best formulation were built for each outcome. The relative benefit¡Vrisk of formulations was assessed with stochastic multicriteria acceptability analyses (SMAA). Key findings: We identified 25 trials (n = 2996). No significant differences among drugs were observed for cure or death. All lipid-based formulations were safer than conventional AB for nephrotoxicity. AB-Intralipid was more tolerable than conventional AB and caused less chills than ABCD. AB-Intralipid was the best therapy (>60%) regarding nephrotoxicity, fever, chills and discontinuation.

Background: With the medical advancement some study put forward that peritoneal drainage is not the necessary after pancreatic surgery; it cannot improve the complications of postoperation even leading to more infection and so on. However, there is no one study can clear and definite whether omitting the drainage after surgery or not. Method: Searching databases consist of all kinds of searching tools, such as Medline, The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, etc. All the included studies should meet our demand of this meta-analysis. In the all interest outcomes blow we take the full advantage of RevMan5 to assess, the main measure is odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence, the publication bias are assessed by Egger test and Begg test. Result: The rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) in no drainage group is much lower than that in routine drainage group (OR=0.47, I2=43%, P&lt;.00001). The result of the 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this pool are almost accord with the former (OR=0.57, I2=0%, P=.05).

Background: There have been significant advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus with the advent of antiretroviral therapy which has been used to successfully reduce the rate of mother to child transmission; leading researchers to hypothesise that human immunodeficiency virus-positive women may desire to have children more so now than in the past. However, this topic is often not discussed in healthcare consultations. Design &amp; Methods: A systematic search was conducted on Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Medline, using the key terms ¡¥fertility decisions¡¦ and ¡¥human immunodeficiency virus positive¡¦. A meta-analysis of proportions and a meta-regression were conducted using a random-effects model and a logit transformation to normalise the data. Heterogeneity was assessed using Q, I2 and R2 values, and p-values were produced for each regressed variable. Results: There was no statistically significant relationship between a desire to have children in the future and any of the prognostic variables. However, there were statistically significant relationships between already having had at least one child; being on antiretroviral therapy; wanting a child in the future; and being in a cohabiting partnership or marriage. Conclusion: There are no reliable prognostic variables which can be used to predict fertility intentions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive women. There is, however, a significant proportion of women who wish to have children or who have already had children and are in need of reproductive counselling from their healthcare providers. Relevance to clinical practice: A greater knowledge of factors which may influence reproductive decisions amongst human immunodeficiency virus-positive position will allow healthcare professionals to individualise the care they provide. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

The intent of this review is to systematically review the literature to assess the safety and efficacy of ureteroscopic procedures in these groups of patients. Methods: The systematic review was performed according to the Cochrane diagnostic accuracy review guidelines. The search strategy was conducted to perform a comprehensive database search (1990-2017). A cumulative analysis was done and where applicable a comparative analysis between bleeding diathesis patients and those without. Results: Eight studies included were all published between 1998 and 2016 with the total number of participants with bleeding diatheses being 1109 with an age range of 18-97. Overall stone-free rate across the studies was 90.8% vs 86.2% in the control group. There was no significant difference in complications between the bleeding diathesis group and control group (N = 12,757, p = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92, 6.02, I2 = 78%).

Previous meta-analyses of this question have omitted key clinical trials or included observational studies. Methods: English-language randomized controlled trials in OvidSP, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library comparing intratympanic versus systemic glucocorticoid therapy for ISSNHL were meta-analyzed using RevMan 5.3. The primary outcome of interest was improvement in pure tone average (PTA) threshold. Results: Six trials involving 248 patients receiving intratympanic steroids and 236 receiving systemic steroids were meta-analyzed. PTA thresholds were similar between the 2 groups at 3 months after therapy initiation (mean difference, 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.43 to 2.91, P = .86; I2 = 54%, P = .07, random-effects model). PTA thresholds were also similar at 6 months (mean difference, 4.69, 95% CI -5.84 to 15.22, P = .38), although the results showed extremely high heterogeneity (I2 = 98%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that a single trial containing 250 patients provided the strongest evidence for equivalence between the 2 types of therapy. Rates of recovery within 3 months (defined as PTA improvement &gt;10 dB) were similar between the 2 types of therapy (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.59-1.43, P = .70), with no significant heterogeneity in the pooled data (I2 = 1%, P = .40).

However, the results remained controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of Mobi-C cervical artificial disc and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with symptomatic degenerative disc disease. Methods: PubMed, EMbase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of Mobi-C versus ACDF on the treatment of symptomatic degenerative disc disease were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were neck disability index (NDI) score, patient satisfaction, and subsequent surgical intervention. Meta-analysis was performed using the random-effect model. Results: Four RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with ACDF surgery for symptomatic degenerative disc disease, TDR using Mobi-C was associated with a significantly increased NDI score (Std. mean difference = 0.32; 95% CI = 0.10-0.53; P = .004), patient satisfaction (odds risk [OR] = 2.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.43-5.27; P = .002), and reduced subsequent surgical intervention (OR = 0.20; 95% CI = 0.11-0.37; P < .001). Mobi-C was found to produce comparable neurological deterioration (OR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.35-1.72; P = .53), radiographic success (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.39-3.59; P = .77), and overall success (OR = 2.13; 95% CI = 0.80-5.70; P = .13) compared with ACDF treatment. Conclusion: Among the 4 included RCTs, 3 articles were studying patients with 1 surgical level, and 1 article reported 2 surgical levels. When compared with ACDF surgery in symptomatic degenerative disc disease, TDR using Mobi-C cervical artificial disc resulted in a significantly improved NDI score, patient satisfaction, and reduced subsequent surgical intervention. There was no significant difference of neurological deterioration, radiographic success, and overall success between TDR using Mobi-C cervical artificial disc versus ACDF surgery. TDR using Mobi-C cervical artificial disc should be recommended for the treatment of symptomatic degenerative disc disease. ? 2017 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Objective: To investigate the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgical ureterolithotomy (MISU) in comparison with ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) for the treatment of large ureteric stones. Evidence acquisition: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed for the conduction of the study, which was registered in the PROSPERO database. Search string was ¡§(laparoscop* OR retroperito* OR robot*) AND ureterolitho*¡¨; database scope included PubMed, SCOPUS, Cochrane, and EMBASE. Primary end points were the stone-free (SFR) and complications rates. Secondary end points included operative time and hospital stay. Subgroup analyses were performed for stones 1¡V2 and &gt;2 cm, as well as different lithotripters and ureteroscopes. Meta-analysis and forest-plot diagrams were performed with the RevMan 5.3.5 software. Evidence synthesis: After screening 673 publications, seven randomized controlled trials were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. A total of 778 patients were pooled after the elimination of the dropouts. No robotic cohorts were found. Only upper ureteral stones were treated in the included studies. The SFR at discharge and 3 mo was higher with MISU with odds ratios of 6.30 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.05, 13.01; I2 = 0%) and 5.34 (95% CI: 2.41, 8.81; I2 = 0%), respectively. The most common complications for MISU and URS were conversion to open surgery and stone migration to the renal pelvis, respectively. Favorable results in terms of operative time were observed in the case of URS with a mean difference of 29.5 min (95% CI: 14.74, 44.26; I2 = 98%). Hospitalization time was favorable in the case of URS with a mean difference of 2.08 days (95% CI: 0.96, 3.20; I2 = 99%). Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed a significantly higher SFR at discharge and 3 mo for MISU in comparison with URS when upper ureteral stones were treated. Operative and hospitalization time favored URS over MISU. Patient summary: The current study investigated the literature on the minimally invasive management of large ureteric stones. The available evidence shows that both ureteroscopic lithotripsy and minimally invasive surgical ureterolithotomy could be considered for the treatment of these stones with similar results. The selection of the approach should be based on the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Minimally invasive surgical ureterolithotomy (MISU) has a higher stone-free rate at discharge and 3 mo in comparison with ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS). Operative and hospitalization time favored URS over MISU. The incidence of complications of both techniques remained low.

Finally, 13 studies with 5915 subjects were considered qualified for meta-analysis. The association of single nucleotide polymorphism with HIV-1 susceptibility was evaluated using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Factoring in healthy controls, results indicate no association between CCR5 -59029A/G polymorphism and HIV-1 infection. Further analysis stratified by ethnicity indicates a significant association among Caucasians under an allelic model (OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.02-1.49, Phet = 0.532) and a dominant model (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.15-1.98, Phet = 0.708). The use of HIV-1-exposed seronegative controls revealed a significant association in a recessive model (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.07-1.78, Phet = 0.954). Our findings indicate that the -59029G allele might be a risk factor for HIV-1 infection among Caucasians.

Long-term hepatitis can ultimately result in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral hepatitis, especially HCV infection, is a major health concern in the Middle East. The current study carried out a systematic search concerning HCV seroprevalence among blood donors in Middle Eastern countries. Evidence Acquisition: Articles were identified through searching databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. We reviewed systematically all studies reporting HCV seroprevalence among blood donors in Middle Eastern countries. Results: A total of 5662 relevant records were identified by the electronic search, of which a total of 47 studies were identified as eligible papers that were meta-analyzed for the pooled seroprevalence of HCV among blood donors. Overall, HCV seroprevalence among blood donors in Middle Eastern countries was estimated 0.88% (95%CI = 0.79%-0.97%). The highest pooled HCV seroprevalence rate was related to Egypt (5.76% [95%CI = 3.30%-8.22%]), Libya (1.56% [95%CI = 0.99%-2.13%]), and Yemen (1.09% [95%CI = 0.69%-1.50%]) while the lowest pooled seroprevalence rate was in Iran and Israel with the rates of 0.14% (95%CI = 0.12%-0.17%) and 0.16% (95%CI = 0.06%-0.25%), respectively. Results of annual HCV seroprevalence suggest that there is a decrease in seroprevalence rate of HCV over time among blood donors in Egypt, Iran, Oman, Lebanon, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. Conclusions: Our results showed that the trend of HCV seroprevalence over time among Middle Eastern blood donors was decreasing.

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT) in detecting serious or invasive bacterial infection (SBI or IBI) in children with FWAS. Areas covered: A systematic review of literature from 2007 to 2017 was performed on Medline. Twelve studies were included, involving 7,260 children with FWAS and analyzing the diagnostic performance of PCT. Four meta-analyses were performed to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operating characteristic curve for PCT in detecting SBI and IBI, at two different thresholds. Considering IBI, PCT sensitivity and specificity at a threshold of 0.5?ng/mL were 0.82 and 0.86, respectively; at a threshold of 2?ng/mL sensitivity and specificity were 0.61 and 0.94, respectively. In detecting SBI, PCT performance was lower, with 55% sensitivity and 85% specificity at a threshold of 0.5?ng/mL, and 30% sensitivity and 95% specificity at a threshold of 2?ng/mL. Expert commentary: Considering IBI, results showed high diagnostic accuracy for PCT. Conversely, PCT performance in diagnosis of SBI was poor. These findings suggest that PCT level determination could be helpful in detecting meningitis, bacteremia and sepsis in children with FWAS. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

In prevention of such, current guidelines support the immediate administration of antibiotic agents. The duration of antibiotic treatment is still controversial. A maximum of 72 hours, even in the absence of definitive soft tissue coverage, is recommended in a number of recent guidelines and consensus reports. The aim of this meta-analysis was to review and analyze all published literature evidence with regard to antibiotic duration in open fracture treatment. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature from the 1970s until the present, including five comparative (1284 open fractures) and 27 observational (5408 open fractures) studies. A subgroup analysis was further performed, based on the Gustilo type of open injury and the anatomic location of the fracture. In addition, we investigated the effect of antibiotic regimes shorter than 72 hours on infection rates. Results: In the comparative studies, the summarized estimate of infection rate favored less than a 72-hour duration of antibiotic treatment, because prolongation of antibiotic treatment more than 72 hours did not seem to offer any protective effect against septic complications of open fractures (odds ratio: 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.60-1.21). The same trend was also documented in the observational studies, where the overall pooled estimate of infection rate was 10% (95% CI: 6.8%-14%) when antibiotic treatment did not exceed 72 hours and 9.2% (95% CI: 6.6%-12.2%) for more than 72 hours of antibiotic treatment (p = 0.53). In Gustilo I and II open fractures, the calculated pooled estimate of infection rate did not differ significantly when antibiotic treatment exceeded 72 hours (6%, 95% CI: 3.3%-9%) compared with shorter (up to 72 h) antibiotic protocols (4%, 95% CI: 1.8%-7%) (p = 0.52). In Gustilo III open fractures also, the calculated pooled estimate of infection rate (21.3%, 95% CI: 13%-31%) when duration of antibiotic treatment was more than 72 hours did not differ significantly compared with a shorter (less than 72 h) antibiotic treatment (17.7%, 95% CI: 12.5%-23.5%) (p = 0.39). A further subgroup analysis indicated that even shorter antibiotic regimes (24-48 h) were also equivalent to prolonged regimes of more than 72 hours in terms of infection rates. Conclusions: The results of the present systematic review and meta-analysis could not substantiate any benefit against septic complications of a prolonged duration of antibiotic treatment of open fractures, irrespective of their severity. ?

The limited awareness of disease burden is a major barrier to the introduction of Hib vaccine into China's National Immunization Program. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate carriage of Hib and burden of its related diseases in Chinese children. Methods We systematically searched Pubmed, Web of Science, Ovid, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases for studies published up to December 31, 2016, reporting Hib carriage and burden of Hib diseases among children in Mainland China. Pooled estimates were obtained using random-effects models. Results We included 27 studies with 15783 children across 14 provinces. The pooled carriage of Hib was 5.87% (95% CI 3.42¡V8.33) for healthy children. The pooled proportion of disease due to Hib were 4.06% (95% CI 3.29¡V4.83) for acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and 27.32% (95% CI 0.41¡V54.24) for bacterial meningitis. The proportion of ALRI caused by Hib was higher in northern China than that in the south. Significant heterogeneity was noted across and within regions (P < 0.001). After the induction of Hib vaccine, meta-regression showed that carriage of Hib changed little (P = 0.725), but the proportion of ALRI caused by Hib in children decreased (P < 0.001). Conclusions Hib carriage persists at low levels among children in China. The proportion of ALRI due to Hib infection decreased with year. Incorporation of Hib vaccine into the National Immunization Program could reduce the burden of Hib disease in China. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases for studies published up to May 2016 that provided raw data for gastrointestinal colonisation by ESBL-PE among LTCF residents was performed. Twenty-three studies reporting data on 9775 screened subjects met the inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of ESBL-PE among LTCF residents was 18% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12¡V24%]. Risk factors for colonisation included recent antibiotic use (within 6 months) [odds ratio (OR) = 2.06, 95% CI 1.78¡V2.38], previous hospitalisation (within 2.5 years) (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.04¡V2.15), history of invasive procedures (within 2 years) (OR = 2.79, 95% CI 1.66¡V4.70), previous ESBL-PE colonisation or infection (OR = 6.77, 95% CI 1.33¡V34.62), history of urinary tract infection (OR = 2.66, 95% CI 1.76¡V4.01) and urinary catheter use (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.29¡V5.04). In conclusion, almost one in five LTCF residents is colonised with ESBL-PE, and colonised residents are more likely to have a history of recent antibiotic use or healthcare facility utilisation. Strict adherence to antimicrobial stewardship in LTCFs is needed to address these high resistance rates. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy"

However, there are differences in the prophylactic programs used for various spinal surgeries. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using intra-wound vancomycin during spinal surgery and to explore the effects of dose-dependence and the method of administration in a subgroup analysis. A total of 628 citations or studies were searched in PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Google Scholar that were published before August 2016 with the terms ¡§local vancomycin¡¨, ¡§intra-wound vancomycin¡¨, ¡§intraoperative vancomycin¡¨, ¡§intra-site vancomycin¡¨, ¡§topical vancomycin¡¨, ¡§spine surgery¡¨, and ¡§spinal surgery¡¨. Finally, 19 retrospective cohort studies and one prospective case study were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The odds of developing postsurgical wound infection without prophylactic local vancomycin use were 2.83-fold higher than the odds of experiencing wound infection with the use of intra-wound vancomycin (95% confidence interval, 2.03¡V3.95; P = 0.083; I2 = 32.2%). The subgroup analysis including the dosage and the method of administration, revealed different results compared to previous research. The value of I2 in the 1-g group was 27.2%, which was much lower than in the 2-g group (I2 = 57.6%). At the same time, the value of I2 was 0.0% (P = 0.792, OR = 2.70) when vancomycin powder was directly sprinkled into all layers of the wound.

Publications were sought which had been made available on the data used by December 2013 and updated to December 2016. The quality of the included studies was assessed according to the guidelines of Loney et al. for the critical appraisal of studies on the prevalence or incidence of a health problem. To verify the presence of heterogeneity between the papers, we used the Chi-squared test based on a Q statistic. A funnel plot was used to test for publication bias. All included studies had across-sectional study design. The association between exposure to waste and positive serology for the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) showed a significant association [odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-2.86; p = 0.0019]. The prevalence rates of HBsAg and anti-HBc seropositivity was 0.04 (95% CI 0.03-0.05) and 0.21 (95% CI 0.14-0.28), respectively (p <0.0001). We found no evidence of publication bias. The results of this meta-analysis indicate a statistically significant association between exposure to solid waste, whether healthcare or domestic, and positive HBV infection markers. Therefore, the working conditions of waste collectors should be analyzed more closely. Immunization against HBV is recommended as the chief preventive measure for all solid waste workers. ? 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All rights reserved."

HEV seroprevalence in patients on maintenance haemodialysis (HD) is unclear with a range from 0% to 44%. In addition, risk factors of transmission of HEV in patients on haemodialysis are unknown. Aim: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of HEV seroprevalence in HD patients compared with controls. Methods: A systematic search of several databases identified all observational studies with comparative arms. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. A random-effects model was used for pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of positive anti-HEV IgG in both groups. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed with appropriate tests. Results: We identified 31 studies from 17 countries between 1994 and 2016. Sixteen studies were judged to have adequate quality and 15 to have moderate limitations. HEV infection was more prevalent in patients on haemodialysis compared with controls (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.79-3.40, I2 = 75.2%, P &lt;.01). We conducted several subgroup analyses without difference in results. Egger regression test did not suggest publication bias (P =.83). Specific risk factors of HEV transmission in patients on haemodialysis were not clearly identified. Conclusions: Hepatitis E virus infection is more prevalent in patients on haemodialysis compared with non-haemodialysis control groups. Further studies are needed to determine risk factors of acquisition, impact on health, and risk for chronic HEV especially among those patients going to receive organ transplantation. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards, we performed a systematic review. Electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify randomised and non-randomised studies comparing outcomes of arthroscopic and open ankle arthrodesis. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodological quality and risk of bias of the selected studies. Fixed-effect or random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Results We identified one prospective cohort study and 5 retrospective cohort studies, enrolling a total of 286 patients with ankle arthritis. Our analysis showed that open ankle fusion was associated with a lower fusion rate (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.13¡V0.52, P = 0.0002), longer tourniquet time (MD 16.49, 95% CI 9.46¡V23.41, P < 0.00001), and longer length of stay (MD 1.60,95% CI 1.10¡V2.10, P < 0.00001) compared to arthroscopic ankle fusion; however, there was no significant difference between two groups in terms of infection rate (OR 2.41, 95% CI 0.76¡V7.64, P = 0.14), overall complication rate (OR: 1.54, 95% CI 0.80¡V2.96, P = 0.20), and operation time (MD 4.09, 95% CI ?2.49¡V10.66, P = 0.22). The between-study heterogeneity was high for tourniquet time but low or moderate for other outcomes. The direction of the effect sizes remains unchanged throughout sensitivity analyses. Conclusions The best available evidence demonstrates that arthroscopic ankle fusion may be associated with a higher fusion rate, shorter tourniquet time, and shorter length of stay compared to open ankle fusion. We found no significant difference between two groups in terms of infection rate, overall complication rate, and operation time. The best available evidence is not adequately robust to make definitive conclusions. Long-term results of the comparative efficacy of arthroscopic ankle fusion over open ankle fusion are not currently available.

Results: The final analysis included 13 studies for HCV genotype 1 (3115 patients). The pooled effect estimate showed that 12-week treatment of genotype 1 patients with the OBV/PTV/r regimen achieved a high SVR rate (PP?=?94%, 95% CI 92¡V96) that increased to (PP?=?97%, 95% CI 96¡V98) upon the addition of DSV. These results were consistent when independent subgroup analyses were conducted based on viral subgenotypes, the presence of cirrhosis, or former treatment failure. Adding ribavirin?(RBV) to this regimen was not associated with increased SVR rates (risk ratio?=?1, 95% CI 0.98¡V1.02), while it increased the risk of serious adverse events (p?=?0.02), insomnia (p?=?0.001), and pruritus (p?<?0.001). Conclusion: The current meta-analysis showed a high efficacy for the OBV/PTV/r regimen in the treatment of HCV genotype 1 (with DSV) infection, regardless of the presence of cirrhosis or former treatment failure.

The risk for CVD is purported to be even higher among people with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection because of the increased inflammatory response, which may synergistically impact CVD risk. However, studies comparing CVD outcomes between HIV alone and HIV/HCV individuals have been discordant. Accordingly, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify and quantify the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and the risk for CVD. We searched EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science from inception to December 2016 to identify studies that provided information on HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD, defined as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and stroke. We used a random-effects model to abstract and pool data on the hazard ratios (HRs) for CVD. HRs were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors including age, sex, smoking, hypertension, diabetes and LDL cholesterol. Among the 283 articles reviewed, four cohort studies met inclusion criteria with a total of 33?723 participants. The pooled adjusted HRs for the association between HIV/HCV coinfection and CVD were 1.24 (95% CI: 1.07-1.40) compared to HIV monoinfection. The test for heterogeneity was not statistically significant (I2=0.0%, P=.397). In conclusion, individuals with HIV/HCV coinfection had an increased CVD risk compared to those with HIV monoinfection.

Studies of the incidence of vulvar cancer-related lymphedema and its risk factors have substantially increased in the new millennium. Objectives: This article is a meta-analysis that aimed to systematically evaluate the incidence of LLL and its risk factors related to vulvar cancer. Data sources: Data were collected from eligible studies from PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. Synthesis methods: Random effects models were used to calculate a pooled overall estimate of LLL incidence, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effects of different study designs, countries of study origin, diagnostic methods, and extent of lymph node surgery. Risk factors for lymphedema were also evaluated. Results: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria for the assessment of lymphedema incidence with a pooled estimate of 28.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 22.1-35.5]. The estimate was 16.7% (95% CI 9.7-23.7) when data were restricted to prospective cohort studies (7 studies). The incidence of LLL was increased by approximately 5-fold in women who underwent inguinofemoral lymph node dissection compared to those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. The reported risk factors included wound infection, inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy, older age, body mass index (BMI), and radiation therapy. Conclusions: Approximately 3 in 10 women who survive vulvar cancer will develop lower limb lymphedema.

The meta-analysis showed significant results in favour of the group on HAART, with lower prevalence for angular cheilitis, erythematous candidiasis, oral herpes, pseudomembranous candidiasis, Kaposi sarcoma, and oral hairy leukoplakia. The prevalence of oral mucosal hyperpigmentation was higher in patients on HAART. These results suggest that the prevalence of oral lesions in HIV-positive patients is lower for those on HAART, which might occur because of the improvement in immunity provided by the therapy. ? 2017 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons"

Both on- and off-pump CABG are reported as effective surgical revascularization strategies for octogenarians by single institution studies. However, the issue of superiority of one strategy over the other for octogenarians remains unresolved due to limited sample size of these studies. A meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes of on- and off-pump CABG in octogenarians was undertaken to address the issue. Methods A literature search was conducted from 1966 through September 2016 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science to identify relevant articles. Primary outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality and stroke. Secondary outcomes of interest were atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, deep sternal wound infection, myocardial infarction, intensive therapy unit (ITU) stay and hospital stay. The random effects model was used to calculate the outcomes of both binary and continuous data to control any heterogeneity between the studies. Heterogeneity amongst the trials was determined by means of the Cochran Q value and quantified using the I2 inconsistency test. All p-values were 2-sided and a 5% level was considered significant. Results Sixteen retrospective studies (18,685 on-pump patients and 8938 off-pump patients) were included in the systematic review. In-hospital mortality (pooled OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.44 to 0.93; p = 0.02), stroke rate (pooled OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.48 to 0.76; p &lt; 0.001) and length of hospital stay (pooled WMD = +0.29, 95% CI = +0.02 to +0.56; p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the off-pump patients. Atrial fibrillation (p = 0.36), acute renal failure (p = 0.47), reoperation for bleeding (p = 0.99), deep sternal wound infection (p = 0.59), myocardial infarction (p = 0.93), and length of ITU stay (p = 0.27) were comparable. Conclusion Off-pump compared to on-pump CABG offers surgical myocardial revascularization to octogenarians with lower in-hospital mortality, stroke rate and length of hospital stay with similar incidence of other adverse outcomes. Preferentially offering off-pump CABG to octogenarians could translate into reduced economic burden on the healthcare providers. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

Methods: Clinical controlled trials of 9 nonoperative regimens for SCI were retrieved in the electronic database. Traditional pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed to compare the efficacy and safety of 9 nonoperative regimens for the treatment of SCI. Weighted mean difference (WMD), odds ratios (OR), and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) were calculated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo engine Open BUGS (V.3.4.0) and R (V.3.2.1) package gemtc (V.0.6). Results: A total of 9 clinical controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were selected in this meta-analysis. On the aspect of efficacy, the results of pairwise meta-analysis indicated that the RAGT+OT and BWSOT might have the best efficacy in SCI patients in terms of a lower extremity motor score (LEMS) compared with conventional OT; the efficacy of RAGT+OT on SCI patients was relatively better than that of conventional OT in terms of walking index for spinal cord injury (WISCI). With the aspect of safety, the constipation rate of placebo on SCI patients was relatively higher than that of venlafaxine XR; however, with respect to headache and urinary tract infection, there was no significant difference in the safety of placebo, pregabalin, GM-1 ganglioside, venlafaxine XR, and fampridine on SCI patients. The results of SUCRA values suggested that BWSOT had the highest SUCRA value (75.25%) of LEMS; RAGT+OT had the highest SUCRA value (88.50%) of WISCI; venlafaxine XR had the highest SUCRA value (94.00%) of constipation; venlafaxine XR had the highest SUCRA value (80.00%) of headache; GM-1 ganglioside had the highest SUCRA value (87.75%) of urinary tract infection. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that the RAGT+OT and BWSOT might have the best efficacy in the treatment of SCI, and the venlafaxine XR and GM-1 ganglioside showed adequate safety for SCI. ?

Setting This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies carried out in SSA at all levels of healthcare (primary, secondary, tertiary and community). Participants The participants of the studies included were HIV-positive pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their male partners. Studies were included if they were conducted in SSA and mentioned an approach used in improving male partner involvement with data on the impact on the uptake of maternal ART uptake. Outcomes In the protocol, maternal ART uptake, infant prophylaxis, safe infant feeding options, condom use and family planning were envisaged. However, only maternal ART has been reported here due to limitations on the word count. Results From an initial 2316 non-duplicate articles, 17 articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. In the combined model, the ORs for complex community interventions, enhanced psychosocial interventions, verbal encouragement and invitation letters were 4.22 (95% CI 2.27 to 7.77), 2.29 (95% CI 1.42 to 7.69), 2.39 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.53) and 1.21 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.63), respectively, whereas in the model using adjusted ORs, enhanced psychosocial interventions had a higher effect than any other intervention. The heterogeneity was moderate using adjusted ORs. Conclusion Enhanced psychosocial interventions and complex community interventions increase male partner involvement and the uptake of PMTCT services more than any other intervention. Invitation letters had no effect. More randomised trials and observational studies (that have adjusted for potential confounders) are needed in the future.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcome of pCND and to provide quantitative evidence. Method A detailed literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrails.gov and Cochrane Library electronic databases for articles published up to October 2016 was carried out. This meta-analysis was performed by the random method (Mantel¡VHaenszel) model. Locoregional recurrence (LRR) and surgical complications were analyzed. Results Twenty-two studies comparing pCND + TT (combined) and TT alone in cN0 PTC patients were analyzed. A total of 6930 cases were enrolled, including 2381 cases in the combined group and 4009 cases in the TT-alone group. Compared with TT alone, patients in the combined group showed a significantly lower rate of overall LRR (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.48¡V0.89) and central compartment recurrence (OR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.22¡V0.73). There was no statistical difference in the rate of lateral compartment recurrence. However, the combined group showed a significantly higher rate of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.92¡V2.27/OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.15¡V2.95) and temporary recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (LNR) (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.08¡V2.16). There was no statistical difference in the rate of permanent LNR, hematoma, hemorrhage or wound infection. Conclusions This meta-analysis revealed that pCND with TT was a significantly efficient way to reduce the risk of LRR. However, pCND + TT increased the incidence rate of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism and temporary LNR. ? 2017"

A literature search was performed from six electronic databases. The key terms of ¡§degenerative scoliosis¡¨ OR ¡§lumbar scoliosis¡¨ AND ¡§fusion¡¨ were combined and used as MeSH subheadings. From relevant studies identified, demographic data, complication rates, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and radiographic parameters were extracted and the data was pooled and analyzed. Long fusion was associated with comparable overall complication rates to short fusion (17% vs 14%, P = 0.20). There was a significant difference in the incidence of pulmonary complications when comparing short versus long fusion (0.42% vs 2.70%; P = 0.02). No significant difference was found in terms of motor, sensory complications, infections, construct-related or cardiac complications, pseudoarthrosis, dural tears, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, or urinary retention. A longer fusion was associated with a greater reduction in coronal Cobb angle and increases in lumbar lordosis, but both findings failed to achieve statistical significance. The ODI was comparable across both cohorts. If shorter fusion lengths are clinically indicated, they should be used instead of longer fusion lengths to reduce perioperative time, costs, and some other complications.

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting IVE against laboratory-confirmed hospitalized influenza among adults. Methods We searched Pubmed (January 2009 to November 2016) for studies that used test-negative design (TND) to enrol patients hospitalized with influenza-associated conditions. Two independent authors selected relevant articles. We calculated pooled IVE against any and (sub)type specific influenza among all adults, and stratified by age group (18¡V64 and 65 years and above) using random-effects models. Results We identified 3411 publications and 30 met our inclusion criteria. Between 2010¡V11 and 2014¡V15, the pooled seasonal IVE was 41% (95%CI:34;48) for any influenza (51% (95%CI:44;58) among people aged 18¡V64y and 37% (95%CI:30;44) among ?65 years).

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2017,Journal of Advanced Nursing,10.1111/jan.13323,28440960,"Aims: To determine the effects of low-flow oxygen therapy with humidified or non-humidified oxygen in adult patients. Background: Although non-humidified oxygen in low-flow oxygen therapy is recommended by many guidelines, humidifying oxygen regardless of oxygen flow has been routinely performed in China and Japan and further studies are needed to evaluate the evidence. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis that comply with the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration were conducted. Data sources: Studies (1980¡V2016) were identified by searching PUBMED, EMBASE, Science Direct, Cochrane library, CNKI and Wanfang Database. Methods: We performed a comprehensive, systematic meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of humidified and non-humidified low-flow oxygen therapy. Summary risk ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using a fixed- or random-effects model. Results: Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials with a total number of 8,876 patients were included. Non-humidified oxygen offers more benefits in reducing the bacterial contamination of humidifier bottles, as shown by the mean operating time for oxygen administration and the respiratory infections compared with humidified oxygen therapy. No significant differences were found in dry nose, dry nose and throat, nosebleed, chest discomfort, the smell of oxygen and SpO2 changes. Conclusions: The routine humidification of oxygen in low-flow oxygen therapy is not justifiable and non-humidified oxygen tends to be more beneficial. However, considering that the quality of most included studies is poor, rigorously designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials are still needed to identify the role of non-humidified oxygen therapy. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

METHODS: The literature databases PubMed?/Medline? and the Cochrane Library? were systematically searched for prospective controlled trials comparing continuous lateral rotational therapy to conventional manual positioning in trauma patients. RESULTS: A total of 8 publications (n= 422 patients) with comparable age and injury severity were included in the meta-analysis. A significant reduction in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (OR: 0.33, [95%CI: 0.17, 0.65], p=0.001) was observed in patients treated prophylactically with continuous lateral rotational therapy. When used with therapeutic intention, CLRT had no impact on the incidence of pneumonia. There were no significant differences in mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay. CONCLUSIONS Analogous to studies evaluating CLRT in medical or mixed patient collectives, CLRT reduced the rates of nosocomial pneumonia in trauma patients. This, however, had no impact on overall mortality. The level of evidence of the studies included was limited by several factors. An adequately powered, well-designed multi-centre randomised controlled trial is required, to validly assess the utility of CLRT for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary complications in patients suffering from trauma.

Therefore, probiotics, which counter pathogenic microorganisms through competitive, antagonistic, and immunological effects, have been used by some clinicians. To date, the effect of probiotics in preventing oral candidiasis in the elderly is controversial. A systematic review that summarizes and critically appraises the available clinical trials is therefore necessary. Design Electronic searches were performed using the Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Only randomized controlled trials were included. The Mantel¡VHaenszel test was used to appraise the odds ratio for single studies and an overall combined odds ratio for all studies combined. Results Three studies matched the inclusion criteria and were homogeneous. The data from one study that estimated candida growth from plaque and saliva were subdivided, thus a total of four studies with 595 people were included. The overall combined odds ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.38¡V0.77). Three studies provided that active treatment reduced the risk of oral candidiasis more than placebo: Hatakka et al.

Overall, there were no statistically significant survival benefits for patients treated with HS (relative risk [RR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-1.12) or HSD (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.80-1.06). Treatment with hypertonic solutions was also not associated with increased complications (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.78-1.36). Subgroup analysis on trauma patients in the prehospital or emergency department settings did not change these conclusions. There was no evidence of significant publication bias. Meta-regression analysis did not find any significant sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence does not reveal increased mortality when the administration of isotonic solutions is compared to HS or HSD in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock. HS or HSD may be a viable alternative resuscitation fluid in the prehospital setting. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum volume and regimen of intravenous fluids for the treatment of trauma patients."

In comparison, efficacy of TAVR is relatively less studied in low- to intermediate-surgical-risk patients. We sought to discover whether TAVR can be as effective as surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low- to intermediate-surgical-risk candidates. Four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 8 prospective matched studies were selected using PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library (inception: March 2017). Results were reported as random-effects odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 9851 patients, analyses of RCTs showed that all-cause mortality was comparable between TAVR and SAVR (short term, OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.86-1.64, P = 0.30; mid-term, OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.75-1.26, P = 0.84; and long term, OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.81-1.16, P = 0.76). The analysis restricted to matched studies showed similar outcomes. In the analysis stratified by study design, no significant differences were noted in the RCTs for stroke, whereas TAVR was better than SAVR in matched studies at short term only (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.33-0.65, P < 0.001). TAVR is associated with reduced risk of acute kidney injury and new-onset atrial fibrillation (P < 0.05). However, increased incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation and paravalvular leaks was observed with TAVR. TAVR can provide similar mortality outcome compared with SAVR in low- to intermediate-surgical-risk patients with critical aortic stenosis. However, both procedures are associated with their own array of adverse events. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Its use has been associated with diverse health outcomes, yet no recent or systematic reviews of these exist. Methods A systematic review of health outcomes associated with crack-cocaine use was performed, using MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and LILACS up to October 2016. Search terms included crack-cocaine and health outcome-related keywords, targeting peer-reviewed studies on quantified health outcomes associated with crack-cocaine use. Random effects meta-analyses produced pooled odds ratios. Levels of evidence for major results were assessed using the GRADE approach. A review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016035486). Results Of 4700 articles returned, 302 met eligibility criteria, reporting on health outcomes for 14 of 22 ICD-10 chapters. Conclusive evidence and meta-analyses showed positive associations between crack-cocaine use and blood/sexually transmitted diseases (HIV and hepatitis C virus, others); moderate evidence and meta-analyses supported associations with neonatal health, and violence. There were mixed associations for mental and other health outcomes, yet insufficient evidence to perform meta-analyses for many categories (e.g., mortality). Most underlying research was of limited or poor quality, with crack-cocaine commonly assessed as a secondary covariate. Conclusions Crack-cocaine use was associated with a range of health outcomes, although it was unclear if there was direct causal impact, interactions between risk factors, or external drivers of both crack-cocaine use and outcomes. Rigorous epidemiological studies are needed to systematically assess health outcomes of crack-cocaine use and underlying pathways, also to inform evidence-based interventions. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

We systematically reviewed the published literature to provide a summary estimate of the association between DM and active tuberculosis (TB). We searched Medline and EMBASE databases for studies reporting adjusted estimates on the TB¡VDM association published before December 22, 2015, with no restrictions on region and language. In the meta-analysis, adjusted estimates were pooled using a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, according to study design. Risk of bias assessment and sensitivity analyses were conducted. 44 eligible studies were included, which consisted of 58,468,404 subjects from 16 countries. Compared with non-DM patients, DM patients had 3.59¡Vfold (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.25¡V5.73), 1.55¡Vfold (95% CI 1.39¡V1.72), and 2.09¡Vfold (95% CI 1.71¡V2.55) increased risk of active TB in four prospective, 16 retrospective, and 17 case-control studies, respectively. Country income level (3.16¡Vfold in low/middle¡Vvs. 1.73¡Vfold in high¡Vincome countries), background TB incidence (2.05¡Vfold in countries with >50 vs. 1.89¡Vfold in countries with 50 TB cases per 100,000 person-year), and geographical region (2.44¡Vfold in Asia vs. 1.71¡Vfold in Europe and 1.73¡Vfold in USA/Canada) affected appreciably the estimated association, but potential risk of bias, type of population (general versus clinical), and potential for duplicate data, did not. Microbiological ascertainment for TB (3.03¡Vfold) and/or blood testing for DM (3.10¡Vfold), as well as uncontrolled DM (3.30¡Vfold), resulted in stronger estimated association. DM is associated with a two- to four-fold increased risk of active TB. The association was stronger when ascertainment was based on biological testing rather than medical records or self-report. The burgeoning DM epidemic could impact upon the achievements of the WHO ¡§End TB Strategy¡¨ for reducing TB incidence. ? 2017 Al-Rifai et al.

Methods A systematic search of the literature was conducted. We included time-series analyses and before-after studies, reporting the incidence of hospitalization for pneumonia in the periods before and after the introduction of PCV10 or PCV13 into the immunization program. Pooled estimates of Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) were calculated by using a random-effects meta-analytic model. Results were stratified according to age-groups (<24 months and 24¡V59 months) and case definitions of pneumonia (clinically and radiologically confirmed pneumonia). Results A total of 1533 potentially relevant articles were identified. Of these, 12 articles were included in the analysis.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to better estimate the effects of early initiation of RRT compared with late initiation of RRT among patients with AKI and in patients at risk for AKI. METHODS: A Medline literature research was conducted in PubMed for RCTs in adult patients with AKI that compared different RRT initiation strategies (early vs late). The meta-analysis outcomes were in-hospital or ?60 day mortality, and renal recovery. RESULTS: Nine trials meeting inclusion criteria and four trials investigating preventive dialysis in patients at risk for AKI were identified. Early initiation of RRT was not associated with reduced in-hospital or 60-day mortality: risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72¡V1.16, p = 0.46, I2 = 49%). When only the four trials that offered RRT within 6 to 12 hours of eligibility were included in the analysis, the results were similar (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82¡V1.06) without significant heterogeneity. The percentage of patients among survivors who recovered enough kidney function to be off dialysis was similar with early compared with late RRT: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99¡V1.06, p = 0.16. Early initiation of RRT was associated with higher incidence of catheter-related infections: RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.03¡V3.21, p = 0.04. No survival benefit was identified in patients undergoing preventive dialysis: RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.52¡V1.41, p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Early RRT in patients with AKI (or at risk for AKI) does not appear to provide a significant reduction in mortality rates compared with late RRT. The data did not suggest any apparent impact on renal recovery with early dialysis.

This meta-analysis of cohort studies compared the treatments in terms of effectiveness and safety. Methods: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, EBSCO, and The Cochrane Library) were retrieved for studies comparing MWA and HRN. The meta-analysis was conducted based on statement of preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 1,480 patients. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in overall survival between the MWA group and the HRN group (HR =0.98, 95% CI =0.76¡V1.26, P=0.878). There was no difference in disease-free survival between the MWA group and the HRN group (HR =1.16, 95% CI =0.79¡V1.71, P=0.442). Meanwhile, the meta-analysis demonstrated that MWA was associated with shorter operation time (standardized mean difference [SMD] =?1.37, 95% CI =?1.92 to ?0.81, P=0.000), less amount of blood loss in operation (SWD =?1.19, 95% CI =?1.76 to ?0.61, P=0.000), and less complications (OR =0.22, 95% CI =0.12¡V0.40, P=0.000) than HRN. Conclusion: In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that MWA may be superior to HRN as it is as effective as HRN in terms of overall survival, disease-free survival, tumor recurrence, and is associated with shorter operation time, less amount of blood loss, and fewer complications. ? 2017 Zhang et al."

Background: Surgical site infections are a major source of morbidity and prolonged hospitalisation following surgery. However, there is a lack of data regarding the impact of different preoperative hair removal techniques on the incidence of surgical site infections. Design: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Methods: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials reporting the impact of different methods of preoperative hair removal on reducing surgical site infections were collected through databases, including the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute Library, PubMed, Elsevier, EMBASE, Nursing Consult, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang data. The articles were published from 1 January 1990¡V15 March 2016. Meta-analyses were conducted with review manager version 5.0. Results: Fourteen trials were included (16 comparisons) in the review, including 11 randomised controlled trials and three controlled clinical trials. Interventions in the studies were shaving, clipping, no hair removal and the use of depilatory cream. The meta-analyses included 7278 patients, from 10 countries. Nine studies compared shaving with no hair removal, four studies compared shaving with clipping, two studies compared shaving with depilatory cream, and one study compared clipping with no hair removal. No significant differences in the frequency of surgical site infections were observed between any of the methods assessed. Conclusions: No significant differences between shaving, clipping, no hair removal and depilatory cream were observed in the frequency of surgical site infections. Relevance to clinical practice: Preoperative hair removal should be avoided unless necessary. When it is necessary to remove hair, the existing evidence suggests that clipping is more effective in reducing surgical site infections than shaving or depilatory cream. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Research methodology A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed of studies identified through Pubmed and Web of Science. Only articles in English were considered. The Downs and Black tool was used to evaluate their methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analysis obtained pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of nosocomial colonisation and infection rates. Results Five eligible before-after studies were identified, encompassing a total of 3033 patients (1192 in the experimental group; 1841 in the control group). Varying protective isolation precautions were investigated, resulting in high clinical heterogeneity. Quality assessment revealed overall poor methodological quality. Protective isolation significantly reduces combined colonisation and infection rates compared to baseline care (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.40¡V0.69; P < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses indicated significant reductions in both nosocomial colonisation (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51¡V0.83; P = 0.02) and infection rates (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.49¡V0.58; P < 0.0001). Conclusions Protective isolation precautions appear to decrease the risk of colonization and infection in burn patients. Because of the absence of higher quality study designs, clinical heterogeneity and the small number of studies involved, these results must be interpreted cautiously. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: A comprehensive search in all scientific literature of the last 30?years was performed in order to identify patient-, trauma-, diagnosis- and treatment-related risk factors. Studies were included when infectious complications were assessed in light of one or more risk factors. A meta-analysis was performed. Risk ratios (RR) or risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results: A total of 116 manuscripts were included. Male gender (RR 1.42), diabetes mellitus (DM) (RR 1.72), smoking (RR1.29), a lower extremity fracture (RR 1.94), Gustilo-Anderson grade III open fracture (RR 3.01), contaminated fracture (RR 7.85) and polytrauma patients (RR 1.49) were identified as statistically significant risk factors for the development of infectious complications. Of the treatment-related risk factors, only pulsatile lavage was associated with a higher infectious complication rate (RR 2.70).

However, notable disadvantages are observed in terms of protracted maturation time, associated high rates of catheter use, and substantial abandonment rates. The aim of this study was to quantitatively summarize the outcomes of fistula patency, infection, maturation, and abandonment published in the scientific literature. Methods This was a systematic review and meta-analyses of studies evaluating fistula outcomes. Literature searches were conducted in multiple databases to identify observational and interventional studies of mean fistula patency rates at 1 year, infection risk, maturation time, and abandonment. Digitisation software was used to simulate individual patient level data from Kaplan¡VMeier survival plots. Results Over 8000 studies were reviewed, and from these, 318 studies were included comprising 62,712 accesses. For fistulas the primary unassisted, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates at one year were 64%, 73% and 79% respectively, however not all fistulas reported as patent could be confirmed as being clinically useful for dialysis (i.e. functional patency). For fistulas that were reported as mature, mean time to maturation was 3.5 months, however only 26% of created fistulas were reported as mature at 6 months and 21% of fistulas were abandoned without use. Overall risk of infection in fistula patients was 4.1% and the overall rate per 100 access days was 0.018. Conclusions Reported fistula patency rates may overstate their potential clinical utility when time to maturation, maturation rate, abandonment and infection are considered. Protracted maturation times, abandonment and infection all have a significant impact on evaluating the clinical utility of fistula creation. A rigorous and consistent set of outcomes definitions for hemodialysis access are necessary to clarify factors contributing to fistula success and the clinical consequence of fistula failure. ? 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery"

Methods Data were extracted through five English and five Persian databases during the period from 1997 to 2016. Overall, 16 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. Results In total, 13,743 blood donors from different regions of world were examined. The prevalence rate of Leishmania infection according to seropositivity obtained 7% (95%CI: 5%, 8%). The lowest and the highest prevalence were related to Bangladesh 0.25% (95%CI: 0.0%, 1.0%) and Brazil, 16% (95%CI: 12%, 19%). Seroprevalence rate of leishmaniasis among females was more (4.60%) than males. Of 15 studies included in the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence rate of molecular tests was obtained 2% (95%CI: 1%, 3%) in which Iran and Spain had the lowest and the highest prevalence, 0.05% and 7%, respectively. Our analysis showed that L. infantum was more common than L. donovani as etiological agent of VL among all donors. Conclusion Our data confirms the presence of asymptomatic carriers of VL in endemic areas and supplies as an attentive to the likelihood of these carriers acting as blood donors. Moreover, we conclude that molecular tests for screening in asymptomatic blood donor provide an accurate estimate of the rate of infection over serological tests. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: A search of electronic information sources (PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL) and bibliographic reference lists identified 12 studies reporting on 362 patients (mean age 72 years; 279 men). The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Endpoints were 30-day/in-hospital mortality and follow-up mortality. Pooled estimates are reported with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The review was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews in Health and Social Care (CRD42016034166). Results: The incidence of graft infection after EVAR was 0.6% (95% CI 0.4% to 0.8%). The time from implantation to diagnosis ranged from 1 to 128 months (mean 25). The majority of patients (293, 81%) underwent surgical treatment (95% CI 77% to 83%); 9 (2.5%) patients (95% CI 21% to 43%) received conservative treatment. Aortic replacement with a prosthetic graft was performed in 58% (95% CI 52% to 62%), whereas cryopreserved allografts and autologous grafts were used in 31% (95% CI 28% to 33%) and 11% (95% CI% 8 to 14%), respectively. Less than half of the patients (40%) had emergency surgery. The pooled estimate of 30-day/in-hospital mortality was 26.6% (95% CI 16.9% to 39.2%). The pooled 30-day/in-hospital mortality for 9 patients treated conservatively was 63.3% (95% CI 30.7% to 87.0%).

Conclusion: Aortic endograft infection is a rare complication after EVAR. Surgical treatment with complete explantation of the infected endograft seems to be the optimal management in selected patients. Supportive medical treatment without surgical intervention has a significant associated mortality. ? The Author(s) 2017."

Pooled vaccine effectiveness in 1825 persons with asthma from 2 test-negative design case-control studies was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 31%-56%) for laboratory-confirmed influenza. Pooled eficacy of live vaccines in reducing influenza was 81% (95% CI, 33%-94%). Live vaccine reduced febrile illness by 72% (95% CI, 20%-90%). Influenza vaccine prevented 59%-78% of asthma attacks leading to emergency visits and/or hospitalizations. For persons with asthma, influenza vaccination may be effective in both reducing influenza infection and asthma attacks. ? The Author 2017.

To date, no network meta-analysis (NMA) of high-quality evidence (double-blind randomized controlled trials) has been performed on this subject. This systematic review and NMA aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different antifungal agents used for prophylaxis of IFI in patients with haematological disorders. Methods: A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA and Cochrane recommendations. The search for articles was conducted on PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science. We searched for double-blind randomized clinical trials comparing antifungal agents for IFI prophylaxis head-to-head vs placebo in patients with any blood cancer. Network meta-analyses were conducted using Addis version 1.16.6. Evaluation of the quality of included RCTs was also performed. Results: Twenty-five trials were included in the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Posaconazole stood out as the best IFI prophylaxis option and for avoiding IFI-related mortality. For the incidence of candidiasis outcome, the azoles were superior to placebo. Voriconazole and posaconazole were, respectively, the first and second best options. For the incidence of aspergillosis outcome, the probability rank suggested that voriconazole followed by liposomal amphotericin B is, possibly, the best choice. The quality of studies was considered good, with a mean Jadad score of 4.0. What is new and conclusion: The results of our work support prophylaxis with antifungal agents as reducing the risk of IFI in haematological patients. Overall, the second-generation azoles were found to be the best option for preventing IFI in this population. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic colectomy (LC) for treatment of TCC in terms of short-term and long-term outcomes compared with open colectomy. Method: A systematic literature search with no limits was performed in PubMed and Embase. The last search was performed on September 15, 2016. The short-term outcomes included intraoperative outcomes, postoperative outcomes, and oncological surgical quality. The long-term outcomes included overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Results: Thirteen articles and one conference abstract published between 2010 and 2016 with a total of 1728 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. LC was associated with significant less estimated blood loss, fewer total postoperative complications, and shorter time to first flatus, time to liquid diet, length of hospital stay, and length of postoperative hospital stay. However, longer operative time was needed in LC. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups concerning the intraoperative complications, mortality, ileus, anastomotic leakage, bleeding, wound infection, abdominal infection, lymph nodes harvested, proximal resection margin, distal resection margin, OS, or DFS. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that LC is a safe and feasible technique for TCC associated with less estimated blood loss, fewer total postoperative complications, quicker recovery of intestinal function, shorter length of hospital stay, and equivalent long-term outcomes. Furthermore, a large-scaled, prospective randomized controlled study is warranted to verify those results. ? Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017."

To synthesize the current literature, we performed a systematic review on the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of Staphylococcus aureus colonization in patients with psoriasis. We modified the QUADAS-2 instrument to assess the reporting quality of individual studies and applied random-effects models in meta-analysis. Overall we identified 21 eligible studies, of which 15 enrolled one or more comparison groups. The pooled prevalence of staphylococcal colonization in patients with psoriasis was 35¡P3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 25¡P0¡V45¡P6] on lesional skin and 39¡P2% (95% CI 33¡P7¡V44¡P8) in the nares. Patients with psoriasis were 4¡P5 times more likely to be colonized by S. aureus than healthy controls were on the skin (RR 5¡P54, 95% CI 3¡P21¡V9¡P57) and 60% more in the nares (RR 1¡P60, 95% CI 1¡P11¡V2¡P32). Cutaneous and nasal colonization by meticillin-resistant S. aureus also appeared higher in patients with psoriasis (pooled prevalence 8¡P6%) than in healthy controls (2¡P6%), yet the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0¡P74). In contrast, despite of a similar risk for nasal staphylococcal colonization (RR 0¡P67, 95% CI 0¡P38¡V1¡P18), patients with psoriasis were less likely to carry S. aureus on lesional skin than atopic patients (RR 0¡P64, 95% CI 0¡P40¡V1¡P02). In summarizing the current literature, we found that patients with psoriasis were at an increased risk for staphylococcal colonization compared with healthy individuals. Prospective studies on how bacterial loads correlate with disease activity can guide the clinical management of bacterial colonization while preventing the emergence of drug-resistant strains. ? 2017 British Association of Dermatologists"

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the most important risk factors for COPD among adults in Chinese Mainland, so as to provide some precautions and interventions on this disease and preventing further recurrences. Methods A comprehensive literature review relating to risk factors for COPD through PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database and VIP database was conducted before March 31, 2017. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated after data combination to assess the associations between risk factors and COPD. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed by I2 and Cochran's Q test. Egger's test was used to assess publication bias. Results A total of 13893 participants (6383 cases and 7510 controls) from 19 case-controls studies were included. 12 risk factors with significant differences found between COPD and control groups were listed as follows: male sex (OR = 1.467; 95%CI: 1.097¡V1.962), smoking (OR = 2.092; 95%CI: 1.707¡V2.565), low educational level (OR = 1.609; 95%CI: 1.206¡V2.147), low BMI (OR = 3.831; 95%CI: 2.223¡V6.603), family history of respiratory disease (OR = 2.068; 95%CI: 1.466¡V2.918), allergy history (OR = 2.381; 95%CI: 1.385¡V4.093), respiratory infection during childhood (OR = 2.695; 95%CI: 1.504¡V4.828), recurrent respiratory infection (OR = 15.015; 95%CI: 4.538¡V49.684), occupational dust exposure (OR = 1.791; 95%CI: 1.151¡V2.788), biomass burning (OR = 2.218; 95%CI: 1.308¡V3.762), poor housing ventilation (OR = 3.993; 95%CI: 1.244¡V12.820), and living around polluted area (OR = 1.631; 95%CI: 1.202¡V2.214).

This meta-analysis of clinical trials summarizes these agents¡¦ toxicity profile. Methods A librarian-guided literature search was conducted in March of 2017. The trials needed to have at least one of the study arms consisting of palbociclib or ribociclib monotherapy at currently FDA approved dose regimens. Heterogeneity across studies was analyzed using I2 statistics. Data were analyzed using random effects meta-analysis for absolute risks. Results Seven randomized trials and 1,332 patients were included in our meta-analysis. There was evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies for serious AEs but not for death. The pooled absolute risk (AR) for all-causality serious AEs and treatment-related death were 16% and 0%, respectively. Patients treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors had an AR of grade 3/4 neutropenia of 61%; neutropenic fever and infections were rare (1% and 3%, respectively).

Asymptomatic carrier pigs may contaminate pork at slaughtering; therefore, pre-harvest reduction of Salmonella load can contribute to reduce public health risk. Multiple studies have evaluated the impact of vaccination on controlling Salmonella in swine farms, but results are highly variable due to the heterogeneity in vaccines and vaccination protocols. Here, we report the results of an inclusive systematic review and a meta-analysis of the peer-reviewed scientific literature to provide updated knowledge on the potential effectiveness of Salmonella vaccination. A total of 126 articles describing the use of Salmonella vaccines in swine were identified, of which 44 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies (36/44) used live vaccines, and S. Typhimurium and S. Choleraesuis were the predominant serotypes evaluated. Vaccine efficacy was most often measured through bacteriological isolation, and pooled estimates of vaccine efficacy were obtained as the difference in the percentage of positive animals when available. Attenuated and inactivated vaccines had similar efficacy [Risk Difference = ? 26.8% (? 33.8, ? 19.71) and ? 29.5% (? 44.4, ? 14.5), respectively]. No serotype effect was observed on the efficacy recorded for attenuated vaccines; however, a higher efficacy of inactivated vaccines against S. Choleraesuis was observed, though in a reduced sample. Results from the meta-analysis here demonstrate the impact that vaccination may have on the control of Salmonella in swine farms and could help in the design of programs to minimize the risk of transmission of certain serotypes through the food chain. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The use of prophylactic antibiotics is empirical as most surgeons fear complications associated with the same. No systematic review has been performed in English on the role of intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics in preventing traumatic endophthalmitis.

The last search was on 5 May 2017. We included patients of all ages with open globe injuries who received intracameral/intravitreal antibiotics, regardless of the dose. Quality of the trials was assessed using Cochrane collaboration tools to assess the risk of bias. The main outcome measures were endophthalmitis and visual acuity. We included three trials. Overall, intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics were noted to significantly reduce the occurrence of endophthalmitis in open globe injuries (relative risk [RR] 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06-0.57). The use of intravitreal/intracameral antibiotics did not have an effect in improving visual acuity (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.61-2.23). Two trials (Narang 2003; Soheilan 2001) were observed to have no significant effect on visual acuity while another trial (Soheilan 2007) did not list visual acuity as part of its objectives. Intracameral/intravitreal antibiotics reduce the risk of endophthalmitis in open globe injuries; although, there was no improvement in the visual acuity. We, therefore, recommend the use of intravitreal/intracameral injections in open globe injuries to prevent this devastating complication. ? 2017 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow."

This review aims to estimate the prevalence of NoV in cases of gastroenteritis in developing countries based on recently published reports. Methods: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and Web of Science for the period January 1, 1990 through March 31, 2016. We included studies performed in developing countries with a study period of at least 12 months and which provided information on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed NoV prevalence in patients diagnosed with acute gastroenteritis. A metaanalysis was conducted on NoV prevalence, focused on viral genogroups GI and GII, in cases of acute gastroenteritis. Results: Using evidence from 178 articles, the estimated NoV prevalence among 148,867 patients with acute gastroenteritis was 17% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15-18%). The prevalence decreased from 18% (95% CI: 16-20%) for upper middle-income countries to 15% (13-18%) and 6% (3-10%) for lower middle- and low-income countries, respectively. There were no significant differences in NoV prevalence by age group (under 5 years, 5 years and over, and mixed ages) or severity of symptoms as defined by community, outpatient, or inpatient setting. The pooled prevalence of NoV GII (15%, 95% CI: 13-17%) was significantly higher than that of NoV GI (1%, 95% CI: 1-1%) in patients with acute gastroenteritis. Conclusion: From the evidence considered in this review, the estimated prevalence of NoV in patients with acute gastroenteritis in developing countries was 17%. This estimate can be used to evaluate the burden of NoV-associated acute gastroenteritis in developing countries, which is currently unclear due to poor diagnosis and surveillance systems, and the estimation may enhance the development of human NoV vaccines.

Methods In June 2017, the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane controlled trials register, Web of Science, Google, and Chinese Wanfang databases were used to identify RCTs and non-RCTs comparing the effects of intraoperative placement of a bipolar sealer versus standard electrocautery with regard to blood loss and blood transfusion. Stata 12.0 software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Weighted mean differences with 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were used for continuous outcomes, and relative risks with 95% CIs were used for discontinuous outcomes. After testing for publication bias and heterogeneity across studies, the data were aggregated and assessed with a random effects model when necessary. Results In total, 6 clinical trials with 560 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that the use of a bipolar sealer decreased the estimated blood loss (MD = ?165.06, 95% CI -236.73 to ?93.40, P < 0.001), the need for a blood transfusion (RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.68, P < 0.001), the transfusion units used (MD = ?0.41, 95% CI -0.60 to ?0.21, P < 0.001), the operative time (MD = ?12.98, 95% CI -21.82 to ?4.15, P = 0.004) and the length of hospital stay (MD = ?2.77, 95% CI -5.45 to ?0.10, P = 0.042). No significant difference was observed for the occurrence of infection (RR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.39, P = 0.192). Conclusion Based on the current meta-analysis, the use of a bipolar sealer is superior to standard electrocautery for reducing intraoperative blood loss and is therefore recommend for use during spine surgery. ? 2017"

A systematic review was undertaken using the MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing low-dose methotrexate with placebo were eligible. Random effect meta-analyses were conducted to assess the risk ratios (RRs) of adverse events associated with methotrexate exposure. Subgroup analyses and random effect meta-regressions were performed to examine the determinants of adverse events. In total, 68 trials (6938 participants) were included. Compared with placebo, low-dose methotrexate slightly increased the risk of adverse events (mean number per individual: 1¡P78?¡Ó?2¡P00 in the methotrexate group, 1¡P53?¡Ó?1¡P89 in the placebo group; P?<?0¡P001), including nausea/vomiting, elevated transaminase levels, mucosal ulcerations, leucopenia, thrombopenia and infectious events, but not the risk of serious adverse events or death. Low-dose methotrexate also increased the number of withdrawals from studies because of adverse events [RR 1¡P32 (1¡P13¡V1¡P53)]. The concomitant prescription of folic/folinic acid was associated with a significant lower risk of any adverse events, and methotrexate prescribed orally was associated with a higher risk of abdominal pain than when prescribed subcutaneously or by intramuscular injection. On the other hand, the risk of adverse events did not increase with the weekly dose or with duration of exposure.

Salivary substitutes and pharmacological agents have been tried only with temporary relief. The use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been contemplated on by various researchers for treatment of xerostomia. We carried out the present review as a systematic compilation and quantitative synthesis of the existing evidence related to the utility of TENS in patients with xerostomia. Methodology Six randomized controlled trials were identified from databases for inclusion and analysed using non-Cochrane mode in RevMan 5.0 software. The heterogeneity between the studies were assessed using Forest plot, I2 statistics wherein more than 50% was considered to have moderate to severe heterogeneity and Chi-square test with a statistical P-value of less than 0.10 to indicate statistical significance. Results Results show that the effect of TENS on salivary flow rate in 369 participants with SMD [95% CI] was 0.63 [-0.03, 1.29] and was not statistically significant. Conclusion To conclude, the current evidence does not support the use of TENS in patients with xerostomia and may be considered as a salivary substitute for symptomatic improvement. However the type, frequency and amplitude of current used needs to be studied in detail. High quality randomized controlled trials with adequate power are required, either to support or refute the use of TENS in xerostomia. ? 2017 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University"

Methods: PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane Collaboration Central databases were searched for studies that compared the results of IMN and VLP fixation for the treatment of distal radius fractures up to March 2016. Stata 11.0 was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results: Six randomized controlled trials (RCT) and two retrospective studies were included in this review, including 463 patients. No significant differences were found between two treatment methods in terms of any functional score, radiographic parameters and motion range in the late post-operative period (6, 12 and 24?months). However, IMN did better than VLP at the post-operative six?weeks and three?months, no matter which functional scoring system was used. The incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) was 8.7% in the VLP group, significantly higher than that (0.8%) in the IMN group (OR, 0.183; 95%CI, 0.045¡V0.74). But for other complications, such as infection (OR, 0.449; 95%CI, 0.095¡V2.114), tendious damage (OR, 0.931; 95%CI, 0.238¡V3.648), tenosynovitis (OR, 0.806; 95%CI, 0.209¡V3.108), algodystrophy (pain) (OR, 0.795; 95%CI, 0.291¡V2.173) and radial nerve paraesthesia (OR, 1.8143; 95%CI, 0.834¡V3.942), no significant differences were found (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to VLP, IMN could provide better early postoperative functional outcomes and reduce the incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome, which could be of particular help in restoring confidence for workers with specialized manual skills to return to their prior jobs. Additionally, the conclusion should be cautiously treated, because it was reached in the context of limited amount of studies and relatively small sample size. Therefore, future studies with good design and large samples are required to verify this conclusion. ? 2017, SICOT aisbl."

The long-term efficacy and safety of the procedures is still a topic of intense clinical research and several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published in the last years Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MUS compared with other surgical treatments for female stress urinary incontinence. Evidence acquisition A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was performed using the Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to update our previously published analyses. Evidence synthesis Twenty-eight RCTs were identified. In total, the meta-analyses included 15 855 patients. Patients receiving MUS had significantly higher overall (odds ratio [OR]: 0.59, p = 0.0003) and objective (OR: 0.51, p = 0.001) cure rates than those receiving Burch colposuspension. Patients undergoing MUS and pubovaginal slings had similar cure rates. Patients treated with RT-TVT had higher subjective (OR: 0.83, p = 0.03) and objective (OR: 0.82, p = 0.01) cure rates than those receiving TO-TVT. However, the latter had a lower risk of intraoperative bladder or vaginal perforation (OR: 2.4, p = 0.0002), pelvic haematoma (OR: 2.61, p = 0.002), urinary tract infections (OR: 1.31, p = 0.04) and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms (OR: 1.66, p = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses limited to RCTs with follow-up durations >60 mo demonstrated similar outcomes for RP-TVT and TO-TVT. No significant differences in efficacy were identified comparing inside-to-out and outside-to-in TO-TVT but vaginal perforations were less common with the former (OR: 0.21, p = 0.0002). Conclusions The present analysis confirms the superiority of MUS over Burch colposuspension. The studies comparing insertion of RT-TVT and TO-TVT showed higher subjective and objective cure rates for the RP-TVT but at the cost of higher risks of some complications and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms. Efficacy of inside-out and outside-in techniques of TO-TVT insertion was similar, although the risk of vaginal perforation was lower in the inside-to-out TO-TVT. Patient summary Retropubic and transobturator midurethral slings are a popular treatment for female stress urinary incontinence. The available literature suggest that those slings are either more effective or safer than other older surgical procedures. Retropubic tapes are followed with slightly higher continence rates as compared with the transobturator tapes but are associated with higher risk of intra- and postoperative complications. The present analysis confirms the superiority of midurethral sling over Burch colposuspension. The studies comparing insertion of retropubic tension-free vaginal tapes and transobturator tension-free vaginal tapes (TO-TVT) showed higher subjective and objective cure rates for the retropubic tension-free vaginal tapes but at the cost of higher risks of some complications and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms. Efficacy of inside-out and outside-in techniques of TO-TVT insertion was similar, although the risk of vaginal perforation was lower in the inside-to-out TO-TVT. ? 2017 European Association of Urology"

Methods We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards. We conducted a search of electronic information sources, including MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; and ISRCTN Register, and bibliographic reference lists to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies investigating outcomes of early versus delayed surgery in patients with acute recurrent diverticulitis. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Results We identified three retrospective and one prospective cohort studies enrolling a total of 1046 patients. The included patients were comparable in terms of age, ASA score and Hinchey classifications (Hinchey I and II). The results of our analyses suggested that there was no difference between two groups in surgical site infection [Odds ratio (OR) 1.61, 95% CI 0.79¡V3.27, P = 0.19], intra-abdominal abscess (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.21¡V4.00, P = 0.91), anastomotic leak (OR1.27, 95% CI 0.50¡V3.25, P = 0.61), 30-day mortality [Risk difference (RD) 0.00 95% CI -0.01¡V0.01, P = 0.80], postoperative ileus (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.50¡V3.66, P = 0.55), postoperative bleeding (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.32¡V2.69, P = 0.89), ureteric injury (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.08¡V5.07, P = 0.65), and overall morbidity (OR 1.42 95% CI 0.76¡V2.66, P = 0.27). The early surgery was associated with longer operative time [Mean Difference (MD) 12.8, 95% CI 5.08¡V20.53, P = 0.001] and length of stay (MD 4.41, 95% CI -0.34¡V8.53, P = 0.03). Among those undergoing laparoscopic surgery, conversion to open surgery was higher in the early surgery group (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.36¡V5.40, P = 0.005). Conclusions The best available evidence suggests that there is no difference between early elective and delayed elective surgery for acute recurrent diverticulitis in terms of clinical outcomes. However, longer operative time and length of stay and higher conversion rate to open surgery associated with early elective surgery may make the delayed elective surgery more cost-effective. The best available evidence is derived from non-randomised studies; therefore, high quality randomised controlled trials are required to provide more robust basis for definite conclusions. ? 2017"

The aim of this study was to elucidate the treatment outcomes of macrolide-containing regimens. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies reporting treatment outcomes of macrolide-containing regimens for MAC-LD using the Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases through 31 July 2016. The rates of treatment success, default from treatment, and adverse events of macrolide-containing regimens were assessed. Treatment success was defined as either 12 months of sustained culture negativity while on therapy or achievement of culture conversion and completion of the planned treatment without relapse. Results In total, 16 studies involving 1462 patients were included. The rate of treatment success was 60.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.1%-64.8%). The proportion of patients who defaulted from the treatment was 16.0% (95% CI, 12.3%-19.7%). When a thrice-weekly dosing schedule was available, the default rate was 12.0% (95% CI, 8.9%-15.0%). Adverse events necessitating treatment discontinuation or dosage modification of macrolides were observed in 6.4% of patients (95% CI, 3.2%-9.5%), and decreased auditory acuity was the most common adverse event. Conclusions Treatment outcomes of macrolide-containing regimens are relatively poor in terms of both the treatment success and default rates. The default rate could be reduced if a thrice-weekly dosing schedule is available. Clinicians should be aware of decreased auditory function as the most common adverse event associated with macrolide-containing regimens. ? The Author 2017.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a treatment for active UC. Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify high-quality studies of FMT as a treatment for patients with UC. The primary outcome was combined clinical remission and endoscopic remission or response. Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic remission, and serious adverse events. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Results: Overall, 4 studies with 277 participants were eligible for inclusion. Among 4 randomized controlled trials, FMT was associated with higher combined clinical and endoscopic remission compared with placebo (risk ratio UC not in remission was 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71-0.89) with a number needed to treat of 5 (95% CI: 4-10). There was no statistically significant increase in serious adverse events with FMT compared with controls (risk ratio adverse event was 1.4; 95% CI: 0.55-3.58). Conclusions: Among randomized controlled trials, short-term use of FMT shows promise as a treatment to induce remission in active UC based on the efficacy and safety observed. However, there remain many unanswered questions that require further research before FMT can be considered for use in clinical practice. ? Copyright 2017 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation."

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease, which affects 8.3% of the world population, summing ?387 million individuals. The consequences of the disease, for example, hyperglycemia, have been associated to a reduced capacity to form bone and poor bone quality, influencing bone healing. Our aim was to systematically review the literature to the effect of diabetic condition on bone regeneration in animal models, when using bone substitute materials from different origins, and perform a meta-analysis to quantitatively study the effect of DM on bone regeneration. Methods: An extensive search strategy was carried out through PubMed and EMBASE to identify the potential relevant studies published from database inception until July 1, 2015. Initially, the title and abstract of 1409 studies were screened, after which inclusion criteria sorted 29 studies for full-text evaluation. After using exclusion criteria, a final number of seven studies could be included in the review. Results: The seven included studies that passed our inclusion/exclusion criteria were all type 1 diabetes, comprising a total of 189 animals and 14 intrastudy comparisons. These studies presented a consistent and reduced risk of bias and showed a significant average effect size of -6.87% of bone formation for diabetes type 1 versus healthy condition [95% confidence interval: -10.55 to -3.18; I2 = 87.4%; p = 0.0003]. Interpretation: These findings prove that DM type 1 negatively influences bone formation compared with a healthy condition, irrespective of the bone substitute material used. ?

This procedure is divided according to its approach: anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF), posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF), transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) and lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF). Each approach has its own theoretical advantages and disadvantages; however, there have been no studies that compared these. Methods Various full-text databases were systematically searched through December 2015. Data regarding the radiological, operative and clinical outcomes of each lumbar interbody fusion were extracted. All outcomes were pooled using random effects meta-analysis, with the relative risk (RR) and/or weighted mean difference (WMD) as the summary statistic. Results Thirty studies met the inclusion criteria. The ALIF procedure has been studied most intensively, followed by PLIF, TLIF and LLIF respectively. All four approaches had similar fusion rates (p = 0.320 & 0.703). ALIF has superior radiological outcome, achieving better postoperative disc height (p = 0.002 & 0.005) and postoperative segmental lordosis (p = 0.013 & 0.000). TLIF had better Oswestry Disability Index scores (p = 0.025 & 0.000) while PLIF had the greatest blood loss (p = 0.032 & 0.006). Complication rates were similar between approaches. Other comparisons were either inconclusive or lacked data. There was marked less studies comparing against LLIF. Conclusions Each approach has their own risks and benefits but similar fusion rates. Despite the large number of studies, there is little data overall when comparing specific aspects of lumbar interbody fusions. More studies, especially RCTs are needed to further explore this topic. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and time sensitivity of human amnion/chorion membrane treatment in patients with chronic DFUs. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were systematically searched to identify relevant articles up to 10 April 2017. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing human amnion/chorion membrane + standard therapy and standard therapy alone in patients with DFUs were included in the analysis. Eligible studies were reviewed and data extracted into standard form. The Cochrane Collaboration¡¦s tool for assessing the risk of bias was used. Review manager version 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using a random effect model. Results: Overall, the initial search of the four databases identified 352 published studies; of these, seven RCTS were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. The overall test effect in the group assessed at 4?weeks was Z?=?4.14 [P?<?0.0001; odds ratio (OR)?0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01¡V0.21]. The overall test effect in the group assessed at 6?weeks was Z?=?4.28 (P?<?0.0001; OR?0.07; 95% CI 0.02¡V0.23). The overall effect in the group assessed at 12?weeks was Z?=?4.96 (P?<?0.00001; OR?0.10; 95% CI 0.04¡V0.24. The results showed that patients receiving amniotic membrane + standard therapy had far fewer incomplete healing wounds than those receiving standard of care alone. Assessment of the wound healing state at 4?and 6 weeks revealed that the wound healing state was almost the same, but there was a net difference of wound healing state at 12?weeks. Conclusion: Human amnion/chorion membrane + standard of care treatment heals DFUs significantly faster than standard of care alone. When using the amnion in patients with DFUs, the optimal times to assess progress in wound healing should be 4 and 12?weeks. ? 2017, The Author(s)."

It is believed that colonization of ulcerated mucosa by bacteria, fungi, and virus results in secondary infections. The effect of chlorhexidine on the incidence and severity of oral mucositis in patients with cancer was evaluated in this review. Methods: Studies were limited to randomized placebo-controlled trials. Three databases were searched: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to May 25, 2016. Results: Ninety-eight abstracts were evaluated by three independent reviewers. Twelve studies met the criteria for inclusion. Four of these studies were assessed at unclear risk of bias and eight of them at high risk. Of the 12 studies, nine were included in two meta-analyses. Pooled results showed that chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce incidence of mucositis compared to placebo (P = 0.129), nor chlorhexidine did significantly reduce the severity of mucositis (P = 0.127), although subgroup analysis in the chemotherapy group showed a trend toward significance (P = 0.054). Side effects reported in the included studies were teeth staining and altered taste perception. Conclusions: This systematic review found that chlorhexidine is not significantly effective in reducing the severity of mucositis (moderate quality of evidence) nor in preventing the incidence of mucositis (low quality of evidence).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of statins in the setting of CLD.Methods:We searched several databases from inception to 17 October 2016 to identify comparative studies evaluating the role of statins in CLD. Outcomes of interest were the associations between statin use and progression of fibrosis, development of hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, and mortality in CLD. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled and analyzed using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the method of detection for progression of hepatic fibrosis and quality of studies.Results:We included 10 studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational) with 259,453 patients (54,441 statin users and 205,012 nonusers). For progression of hepatic fibrosis, pooled HR (95% confidence interval) was 0.49 (0.39-0.62). On subgroup analysis of studies using ICD-9 (The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) coding and a second method to detect cirrhosis, pooled HR was 0.58 (0.51-0.65); pooled HR for studies using ICD-9 coding only was 0.36 (0.29-0.44). For progression of fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pooled HR was 0.52 (0.37-0.73). For hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, pooled HR was 0.54 (0.46-0.65). For mortality, pooled HR based on observational studies was 0.67 (0.46-0.98); in the randomized controlled trial, HR was 0.39 (0.15-0.99). However, the quality of evidence for these associations is low as most included studies were retrospective in nature and limited by residual confounding.Conclusions:Statins may retard the progression of hepatic fibrosis, may prevent hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, and may reduce all-cause mortality in patients with CLD. As the quality (certainty) of evidence is low, further studies are needed before statins can be routinely recommended. ? 2017 by the American College of Gastroenterology."

Materials and Methods: The databases of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and four Chinese databases were searched for eligible studies. Weighted mean differences and standardized mean differences (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to summarize the primary outcome, namely, steroid-sparing effect of tacrolimus in maintaining minimal manifestations, and the secondary outcome, namely, the effect of tacrolimus in reducing the severity of MG, respectively. Results: After systematic retrieval, 13 researches with two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 11 prospective open-label single-arm clinical trials were included in the study. For the primary outcome of two RCTs, one RCT which was followed up for 1 year showed a positive effect and the other RCT which was associated with treatment duration of 28 weeks showed a negative result. For the secondary outcome, meta-analyses of other 11 trials showed a benefit effect, overall. For the quantitative MG (QMG) score, there were significant differences with high heterogeneity (SMD: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.14-4.73; I2 = 86%). In contrast, for MG activities of daily living (MGADL) score, it was reduced by tacrolimus with significant SMD and less heterogeneity (SMD: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.33-0.85; I2 = 7%). Adverse effects were mentioned as mild. Discussion: The opposite results of two RCTs showed that tacrolimus with enough treatment duration might have positive steroid-sparing effect. The most possible cause of heterogeneity in the outcome of QMG score between trials was the baseline severity of MG. Conclusion: The above finding suggests that there might be a potential beneficial role with no serious side effects of tacrolimus, and additional better RCTs including larger sample sizes and long-term study are needed to confirm or refute the results."

METHODS We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed and seven other databases through January 1990 to March 2017 for published studies that evaluated the association between PPIs and CDI. Adult case-control and cohort studies providing information on the association between PPI therapy and the development of CDI were included. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random effect. Heterogeneity was assessed by I 2 test and Cochran's Q statistic. Potential publication bias was evaluated via funnel plot, and quality of studies by the Newcastle-Otawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). RESULTS Fifty-six studies (40 case-control and 16 cohort) involving 356683 patients met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Both the overall pooled estimates and subgroup analyses showed increased risk for CDI despite substantial statistical heterogeneity among studies. Meta-analysis of all studies combined showed a significant association between PPI users and the risk of CDI (pooled OR = 1.99, CI: 1.73-2.30, P < 0.001) as compared with non-users.

Furthermore, ABO-I LT was associated with more incidences of antibody-mediated rejection (OR = 74.21, 95%CI: 16.32-337.45, P < 0.001), chronic rejection (OR =2.28, 95%CI: 1.00-5.22, P = 0.05), cytomegalovirus infection (OR = 2.64, 95%CI: 1.63-4.29, P < 0.001), overall biliary complication (OR = 1.52, 95%CI: 1.01-2.28, P = 0.04), and hepatic artery complication (OR = 4.17, 95%CI: 2.26-7.67, P < 0.001) than ABO-C LT. In subgroup analyses, ABO-I LT and ABO-C LT showed a comparable graft survival in pediatric patients and those using rituximab, and ABO-I LT showed an increased acute cellular rejection in cases involving deceased donor grafts. CONCLUSION Although patient survival in ABO-I LT was comparable to that in ABO-C LT, ABO-I LT was inferior to ABO-C LT in graft survival and several complications. Graft survival of ABO-I LT could be comparable to that of ABO-C LT in pediatric patients and those using rituximab. ? The Author(s) 2017. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

A broad search was conducted in two electronic databases. Each citation was appraised using screening tools designed and tested a priori. Level 1 relevance screening excluded irrelevant citations; level 2 confirmed relevance and categorized. Data were then extracted, and intervention categories were descriptively summarized. Meta-analysis was performed to provide a summary estimate of treatment effect where two or more studies investigated the same intervention in comparable populations. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the confidence in the estimated summary measures of intervention effect for each data subgroup. Data were also extracted from the control groups of 25 challenge trials captured by the review, to fit logistic regression models of Salmonella infection in pigs, using odds of infection as the outcome measure. The only intervention captured by the review which was significantly associated with reduced risk of Salmonella in field settings, was elimination of lairage, which is not currently feasible commercially. The logistic regression model for fecal Salmonella shedding in pigs with a random intercept for trial yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of infection: oral challenge route relative to intra-nasal, log increase in challenge dose, and elapsed time post-challenge. Univariable exact logistic regression modeling lymph node contamination post-challenge yielded the following predictors significantly associated with increased odds of Salmonella infection: younger animals relative to older ones; intra-nasal challenge route relative to oral route; and animals sampled within the first 7?days post-challenge relative to those sampled at 14 or 21?days. We hypothesize that the presence of absence of one or more of these predictors across studies could help to explain the inconsistent and/or non-significant findings reported for some interventions applied at lairage. ? 2017"

Thus, improved therapeutics targeting cystogenesis remains a constant challenge. Microarray studies in single ADPKD animal models species with limited sample sizes tend to provide scattered views on underlying ADPKD pathogenesis. Thus we aim to perform a cross species meta-analysis to profile conserved biological pathways that might be key targets for therapy. Methods Nine ADPKD microarray datasets on rat, mice and human fulfilled our study criteria and were chosen. Intra-species combined analysis was performed after considering removal of batch effect. Significantly enriched GO biological processes and KEGG pathways were computed and their overlap was observed. For the conserved pathways, biological modules and gene regulatory networks were observed. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) was performed for genes found in conserved pathways. Results We obtained 28 modules of significantly enriched GO processes and 5 major functional categories from significantly enriched KEGG pathways conserved in human, mice and rats that in turn suggest a global transcriptomic perturbation affecting cyst ¡V formation, growth and progression. Significantly enriched pathways obtained from up-regulated genes such as Genomic instability, Protein localization in ER and Insulin Resistance were found to regulate cyst formation and growth whereas cyst progression due to increased cell adhesion and inflammation was suggested by perturbations in Angiogenesis, TGF-beta, CAMs, and Infection related pathways. Additionally, networks revealed shared genes among pathways e.g. SMAD2 and SMAD7 in Endocytosis and TGF-beta. Conclusion Our study suggests cyst formation and progression to be an outcome of interplay between a set of several key deregulated pathways. Thus, further translational research is warranted focusing on developing a combinatorial therapeutic approach for ADPKD redressal. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Healthcare workers (HCWs), patients and the environment may act as reservoirs for the spread of MRSA to patients and other HCWs. Screening and eradication of MRSA colonization is an effective method of reducing the MRSA infection rate. There are limited data on the prevalence of MRSA among Iranian HCWs. We performed a systematic search by using different electronic databases including Medline (via PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, and Iranian Databases (from January 2000 to July 2016). Meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (Biostat V2.2) software. The meta-analyses showed that the prevalence of S. aureus and MRSA among HCWs were 22.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 19.3-26.6] and 32.8% (95% CI: 26.0-40.4) respectively. The high rate of nasal MRSA carriage among Iranian HCWs has been attributed to poor compliance to hand hygiene, injudicious use of antibiotics, and ineffective infection control and prevention measures. The rational use of antibiotics plus strict infection control are the main pillars for controlling multidrug resistant microorganisms such as MRSA in the hospital setting. These measurements should be applied nationally. ? 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All rights reserved."

However, no meta-analysis or conclusive review has investigated whether individuals with HIV infection have a significantly higher prevalence of ED. Aim To explore the exact association between HIV infection and the prevalence of ED. Methods The PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify studies concerning the association between HIV infection and the prevalence of ED that were published up to December 2016. Manual searches also were performed. Relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the strength of association between HIV infection and the prevalence of ED. The methodologic quality of the included cohort studies was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The cross-sectional study quality methodology checklist was used to assess the quality of cross-sectional studies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential bias. This study was conducted according to the guidelines for Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies (MOOSE). Outcomes The strength of association between HIV infection and the prevalence of ED was evaluated using summarized unadjusted pooled relative risks and 95% confidence intervals. Results Two cohort studies and three cross-sectional studies involving 4,252 participants were included. Mean age of patients ranged from 35.2 to 52 years in the included studies. Based on the random-effects model, analyses of all studies showed that HIV infection was significantly associated with an increased prevalence of ED (relative risk = 2.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.52¡V3.55, P &lt;.001). There was significant heterogeneity among included studies (I2 = 84%, P &lt;.001). Estimates of total effects were generally consistent with the sensitivity. Clinical Implications Individuals with HIV infection had a significantly increased prevalence of ED, which suggests that ED should be of concern to clinicians when managing men with HIV infection. Strengths and Limitations A strength of this study is that it is the first meta-analysis to explore the relation between HIV infection and the prevalence of ED. A limitation is that all included studies were observational studies, which can induce recall bias or selection bias. Conclusion Evidence from the observational studies suggested that individuals with HIV infection had a significantly increased prevalence of ED despite significant heterogeneity.

Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an approved treatment for recurrent or refractory CDI but there is uncertainty about its use. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of FMT in treating recurrent and refractory CDI and investigate outcomes from modes of delivery and preparation. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, trial registers and conference proceedings were searched. Studies on FMT in recurrent and refractory CDI were included. The primary outcome was clinical resolution with subgroup analyses of modes of delivery and preparation. Random effects meta-analyses were used to combine data. Results: Thirty seven studies were included; seven randomised controlled trials and 30 case series. FMT was more effective than vancomycin (RR: 0.23 95%CI 0.07-0.80) in resolving recurrent and refractory CDI. Clinical resolution across all studies was 92% (95%CI 89%-94%). A significant difference was observed between lower GI and upper GI delivery of FMT 95% (95%CI 92%-97%) vs 88% (95%CI 82%-94%) respectively (P=.02). There was no difference between fresh and frozen FMT 92% (95%CI 89%-95%) vs 93% (95%CI 87%-97%) respectively (P=.84). Administering consecutive courses of FMT following failure of first FMT resulted in an incremental effect. Donor screening was consistent but variability existed in recipient preparation and volume of FMT. Serious adverse events were uncommon. Conclusion: Faecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for recurrent and refractory Clostridium difficile infection, independent of preparation and route of delivery. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene are one of the main mechanisms leading to the resistance to clarithromycin in Iran. The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains in Iran and to identify the major molecular mechanisms of resistance in the resistant isolates. Methods Using related keywords and computer search in English and Persian databases (up to November 21, 2016), available data about prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains and molecular mechanisms of resistance in Iran were retrieved. Relevant articles were selected using pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results The results of the meta-analysis showed that the overall prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains in Iran is 14.7%. The highest and the lowest resistance to clarithromycin were reported from Kashan (33.7%) and Rasht (5.5%), respectively. The most prevalent point mutations in Iran were A2143G (59.1%), A2142G (17.8%), A2142C (8.8%), and A2144G (6.2%), respectively. Conclusion The prevalence of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains was in an acceptable level in our region. Therefore, clarithromycin can be used for the eradication of H. pylori infection in Iran. However, it seems that investigation about the role of other mechanisms involved in the induction of resistance to clarithromycin is needed. ? 2017 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer"

However, the clinicopathologic value of ARID1A mutation or protein level in GC and CRC patients is controversial. Hence, we conducted a meta-Analysis on the relationship between ARID1A aberrations and clinicopathologic parameters in GC and CRC. Materials and Methods: Relevant published studies were selected from PubMed and EMBASE. The effect sizes of ARID1A mutation or level on the patient's clinicopathologic parameters were calculated by prevalence rate or odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR), respectively. The effect sizes were combined using a random-effects model. Results: The frequency of ARID1A mutation and loss of ARID1A protein expression in GC patients was 17% and 27%, respectively. The loss of ARID1A protein expression of GC patients was significantly associated with advanced tumor depth (OR = 1.8, P = 0.004), lymph node metastasis (OR = 1.4, P = 0.001), and unfavorable adjusted overall survival (HR = 1.5, P < 0.001). ARID1A mutation of GC was significantly associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) (OR = 24.5, P < 0.001) and EBV infection (OR = 2.6, P = 0.001). The frequency of ARID1A mutation and ARID1A protein expression loss in CRC patients was approximately 12-13%. Interestingly, the loss of ARID1A protein expression in CRC patients was significantly associated with poorly differentiated grade (OR = 4.0, P < 0.001) and advanced tumor depth (OR = 1.8, P = 0.012). Conclusion: Our meta-Analysis revealed that ARID1A alterations may be involved in the carcinogenesis of GC by EBV infection and MSI. The loss of ARID1A protein expression may be a marker of poor prognosis in GC and CRC patients."

Conclusion The present meta-analysis and systematic review indicated that the studies generally found small improvement in HIV-related knowledge and reduction in negative attitudes towards PLHIV among the stigma reduction programs being evaluated. High-quality stigma reduction programs with multidimensional stigma indicators and psychometrically sound outcome measures are highly warranted. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

However, assessing the efficacy of the different modalities of skin closure has been an underappreciated topic. The present study aims to provide further insight by conducting a meta-analysis and systematic review evaluating the rates of common complications and perioperative quality outcomes associated with different suture and staple skin closure techniques after TKA. Methods The present study was conducted in accordance with both the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Statement and the Cochrane Handbook for meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Primary outcome measures evaluated rates of common complications associated with primary TKA. Secondary outcome measures evaluated wound closure time, direct surgical costs, and cosmetic and knee function outcomes. Results Our meta-analysis demonstrated that skin sutures had a higher likelihood of superficial and deep infections, abscess formation, and wound dehiscence. Conversely, staples had a higher tendency for prolonged wound discharge. A systematic review of wound closure times and overall resource utilization demonstrated that wound closure was faster and more cost-effective with skin staples than sutures. Conclusion Primary skin incision closure with staples demonstrated lower wound complications, decreased wound closure times, and an overall reduction in resource utilization. Given these outcomes, the use of staples after TKA may have several subtle clinical advantages over sutures. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) improves the diagnosis accuracy of PCL. Systematic evaluation of morbidity and mortality associated with EUS-FNA for PCL has not been carried out. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of morbidity and mortality associated with EUS-FNA. Methods: A literature search for relevant English-language articles was conducted on PubMed and EMBASE databases. Main outcome measures for this analysis were adverse effects of diagnostic EUS-FNA, and the associated morbidity and mortality, in patients with PCL. Results: Forty studies, with a combined subject population of 5124 patients with PCL, satisfied the inclusion criteria. Overall morbidity as a result of adverse events of EUS-FNA was 2.66% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.84¡V3.62%), and the associated mortality was 0.19% (95% CI: 0.09¡V0.32%). Common post-procedure adverse events included pancreatitis 0.92% (95% CI: 0.63¡V1.28%), hemorrhage 0.69% (95% CI: 0.42¡V1.02%), pain 0.49% (95% CI: 0.27¡V0.79%), infection 0.44% (95% CI: 0.27¡V0.66%), desaturation 0.23% (95% CI: 0.12¡V0.38%) and perforation 0.21% (95% CI: 0.11¡V0.36%). There was no peritoneal seeding in our study. Incidence of adverse events associated with prophylactic periprocedural antibiotic use was 2.77% (95% CI: 1.87¡V3.85%). Conclusions: EUS-FNA is a safe procedure for diagnosis of PCL and is associated with a relatively low incidence of adverse events. Most adverse events were mild, self-limiting, and did not require medical intervention. ? 2017 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society"

A meta-analysis,2017,Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews,10.1002/dmrr.2902,28437854,"The association of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with diabetes is inconsistent and varies widely across primary epidemiological studies. A comprehensive and more precise estimate of this association is fundamental to establishing a plausible causal link between ART and diabetes. We identified epidemiological studies that compared mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations and proportions of diabetes and metabolic syndrome between HIV-infected patients na?ve and exposed to ART. Mean difference in FPG concentrations and odds ratios of diabetes and metabolic syndrome were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. Data on 20?178 participants from 41 observational studies were included in the meta-analyses. Mean FPG concentrations (Pooled mean difference: 4.66?mg/dL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.52 to 6.80; 24 studies) and the odds of diabetes (Pooled odds ratios: 3.85; 95% CI, 2.93 to 5.07; 10 studies) and metabolic syndrome (Pooled odds ratios: 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.03; 18 studies) were significantly higher among ART-exposed patients, compared to their na?ve counterparts. ART was also associated with significant increases in FPG levels in studies with mean ART duration ?18?months (Pooled mean difference: 4.97?mg/dL; 95% CI, 3.10 to 6.84; 14 studies), but not in studies with mean ART duration <18?months (Pooled mean difference: 4.40?mg/dL, 95% CI, ¡V0.59 to 9.38; 7 studies). ART may potentially be the single most consistent determinant of diabetes in people living with HIV worldwide. However, given the preponderance of cross-sectional studies in the meta-analysis, the association between ART and diabetes cannot be interpreted as cause and effect.

Treatment with tranexamic acid (TXA) by intravenous application has been discussed extensively. Recently, several studies have reported that oral administration has an effect on blood sparing. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety between oral TXA and intravenous TXA (IV-TXA) for blood sparing in total knee and hip arthroplasty. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or retrospective cohort studies (RCSs) about relevant research were searched for by using PubMed (1996¡VApril 2017), Embase (1980¡VApril 2017), and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, April 2017). Five studies that compared oral with IV administration of TXA were included in our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis results were collected and analyzed by the software Review Manager 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Center, The Collaboration, 2014). Results Five studies containing 3474 patients met the inclusion criteria. Our pooled data analysis indicated that oral TXA was as effective as the IV-TXA in terms of the average Hb drop (P = 0.88), total Hb loss (P = 0.57), total blood loss (P = 0.42), transfusion rate (P = 0.16), complications (P = 0.61), and length of hospital stay (P = 1.00). Conclusions Compared with the IV-TXA method, oral TXA shows similar blood-sparing efficacy for preventing hemoglobin drop, total hemoglobin loss, and total blood loss following TKA or THA. In addition, no significant differences of transfusion rate, complications, or length of hospital stay were found between the 2 groups. However, because of the limited number of included studies, more studies of high quality are needed to further identify the optimal administration time for oral TXA. ? 2017"

A literature search yielded 14 case-control studies. We calculated pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals in three groups according to severity, dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue (DEN) using standard genetic models. Pooled ORs were subjected to modifier treatment where re-analysis was confined to Hardy-Weinberg compliant (HWC) studies. Heterogeneity of outcomes warranted examining their sources with outlier treatment. In subgroup analysis, we compared Asian and South/Central American (SCA)/Brazilian effects. Overall pooled outcomes yielded no significant effects (OR 0.66-1.44, P?=?0.08¡V0.96). In the dominant-codominant model, pooled effects were heterogeneous (I2?=?47%¡V71%) which was lost/reduced (I2?=?0%¡V43%) when outlier treatment was applied. This also yielded significant associations (OR 0.68-0.77, P?=?0.02¡V0.05). Our results are best seen in the Asian subgroup, which in itself already yielded significant effects in DEN (OR 0.62¡V0.67, P?=?0.01¡V0.02). These reduced risk findings were significant from the tests of interaction (P?=?0.001¡V0.02) which highlights the protective effects of TNF£\-308 among Asians. TNF£\-308 effects on dengue are based on significance and non-heterogeneity of the post-outlier outcomes in the dominant and codominant models. Here, pooled effects may also be ethnic specific, where Asians are protected but not SCA. Both modified and Asian effects are up to 38% protective. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

No differences were found for anthropomorphic parameters at birth; one study reported minor differences in z-scores for length and head circumference at age 1 year. Conclusions: TDF-based ART in pregnancy seems generally safe for women and their infants.

Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase were searched to identify primary research studies published between January 1, 1967, and October 31, 2016. We only included observational epidemiological studies and used risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to summarize the primary risk factors associated with recurrence following laryngectomy. Results: A total of 44 articles, including 11 928 patients, were included in the current meta-analysis. The pooled estimates of the stomal recurrence rate and the local recurrence rate following laryngectomy were 6.60% (95% CI, 5.40-7.90) and 19.40% (95% CI, 14.00%-24.80%), respectively. For stomal recurrence, we confirmed a series of earlier identified factors, including tumor site, prior tracheotomy, tracheotomy timing, T-classification, lymph node metastases, postoperative pharyngoperistomal fistula, and a positive surgical margin. For local recurrence, postoperative radiotherapy, overexpression of p53, and overexpression of p21 were significant, while preoperative tracheostomy and postoperative pharyngoperistomal fistula had an unexpectedly low impact on risk.

Objective: This systematic review assessed the prevalence and associated mortality impact of HIVseropositivity among injured patients in LMIC. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL, POPLINE and Cochrane databases through August 2016 was performed. Prospective and cross-sectional reports of injured patients from LMIC that evaluated HIV-serostatus were included. Two reviewers identified eligible records (kappa=0.83); quality was assessed using GRADE criteria. HIV-seroprevalence and mortality risks were summarized and pooled estimates were calculated using random-effects models with heterogeneity assessed. Results: Of 472 retrieved records, sixteen met inclusion. All reports were of low or very low quality and derived from sub-Saharan Africa. HIV-serostatus was available for 3,994 patients. Individual report and pooled HIV-seroprevalence estimates were uniformly greater than temporally matched national statistics (range: 4.5-35.0%). Pooled reports from South Africa were three-fold greater than matched national prevalence (32.0%, 95% CI, 28.0-37.0%). Mortality data were available for 1,398 patients. Heterogeneity precluded pooled mortality analysis. Among individual reports, 66.7% demonstrated significantly increased relative risks (RR) of death; none found reduced risk of death among HIV-seropositive patients. Increased mortality risk among HIV-seropositive patients ranged from 1.86 (95% CI, 1.11-3.09) in Malawi to 10.7 (95% CI, 1.32-86.1) in South Africa. Conclusion: The available data indicate that HIV-seropositivity among the injured is high relative to national rates and may increase mortality, suggesting that integrated HIV-injury programming could be beneficial.

The aim of the systematic review was to identify whether inpatient penicillin allergy testing affected clinical outcomes during hospitalization. Methods: We performed an electronic search of Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library over the past 20?years. Inpatients having a documented penicillin allergy that underwent penicillin allergy testing were included. Results: Twenty-four studies met eligibility criteria. Study sample size was between 24 and 252 patients in exclusively inpatient cohorts. Penicillin skin testing (PST) with or without oral amoxicillin challenge was the main intervention described (18 studies). The population-weighted mean for a negative PST was 95.1% [CI 93.8-96.1]. Inpatient penicillin allergy testing led to a change in antibiotic selection that was greater in the intensive care unit (77.97% [CI 72.0-83.1] vs 54.73% [CI 51.2-58.2], P<.01). An increased prescription of penicillin (range 9.9%-49%) and cephalosporin (range 10.7%-48%) antibiotics was reported. Vancomycin and fluoroquinolone use was decreased. Inpatient penicillin allergy testing was associated with decreased healthcare cost in four studies. Conclusions: Inpatient penicillin allergy testing is safe and effective in ruling out penicillin allergy. The rate of negative tests is comparable to outpatient and perioperative data. Patients with a documented penicillin allergy who require penicillin should be tested during hospitalization given its benefit for individual patient outcomes and antibiotic stewardship. ? 2017 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials that examined the effectiveness and/or safety of nucleoside antiviral drugs for recurrent herpes labialis were identified via a literature search. The parameters used to measure efficacy were time to healing of classic and all lesions, time to resolution of pain, and percentage of aborted lesions. Safety was assessed by evaluating the adverse events reported during treatment. Subgroup analyses based on the mode of application (topical/systemic) and type of nucleoside antiviral drugs were performed, as were sensitivity analyses of studies with a low risk of bias. Results: Our analysis included 16 publications reporting 25 randomized controlled trials (8453 patients). Nucleoside antiviral drugs decreased the time to healing of all lesions (mean difference: ?0.74 days; 95% confidence interval: ?0.86, ?0.62), especially classic lesions (mean difference: ?1.09 days; 95% confidence interval: ?1.27, ?0.92). They also reduced the time to resolution of pain (mean difference: ?0.38 days; 95% confidence interval: ?0.58, ?0.18) and increased the percentage of aborted lesions (rate ratio: 1.15; 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.23). Valaciclovir more effectively reduced the time to healing of all lesions and the time to resolution of pain than did aciclovir. Both nucleoside antiviral drugs increased the percentage of aborted lesions, whereas penciclovir and famciclovir did not. Conclusions: Nucleoside antiviral drugs are safe and beneficial for the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis; both systemic and topical formulations are recommended.

However, due to unsatisfactory patient tolerance, various weekly low-dose schedules have been increasingly used in clinical practice. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy, safety, and compliance between these two approaches. Materials and Methods: We systematically searched literature for prospective trials of patients with LA-SCCHN who received postoperative or definitive conventionally fractionated concurrent chemoradiation. Radiation doses were usually 60¡V66 gray (Gy) in the postoperative setting and 66¡V70 Gy in the definitive setting. Standard, three-weekly high-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2, 3 doses) was compared with the weekly low-dose protocol (?50 mg/m2, ?6 doses). The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary outcomes comprised response rate, acute and late adverse events, and treatment compliance. Results: Fifty-two studies with 4,209 patients were included in two separate meta-analyses according to the two clinical settings. There was no difference in treatment efficacy as measured by overall survival or response rate between the chemoradiation settings with low-dose weekly and high-dose three-weekly cisplatin regimens. In the definitive treatment setting, the weekly regimen was more compliant and significantly less toxic with respect to severe (grade 3¡V4) myelosuppression (leukopenia p =.0083; neutropenia p =.0024), severe nausea and/or vomiting (p &lt;.0001), and severe nephrotoxicity (p =.0099). Although in the postoperative setting the two approaches were more equal in compliance and with clearly less differences in the cisplatin-induced toxicities, the weekly approach induced more grade 3¡V4 dysphagia (p =.0026) and weight loss (p &lt;.0001). Conclusion: In LA-SCCHN, current evidence is insufficient to demonstrate a meaningful survival difference between the two dosing regimens. Prior to its adoption into routine clinical practice, the low-dose weekly approach needs to be prospectively compared with the standard three-weekly high-dose schedule. Implications for Practice: Given concurrently with conventional radiotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer, high-dose three-weekly cisplatin has often been replaced with weekly low-dose infusions to increase compliance and decrease toxicity. The present meta-analysis suggests that both approaches might be equal in efficacy, both in the definitive and postoperative settings, but differ in toxicity. However, some toxicity data can be influenced by unbalanced representation, and the conclusions are not based on adequately sized prospective randomized studies. Therefore, low-dose weekly cisplatin should not be used outside clinical trials but first prospectively studied in adequately sized phase III trials versus the high-dose three-weekly approach. ?

When the disaggregated pre-HAART studies (n?=?4) were included, the relapse rate was 14.9% (random effects; 95% CI?=?3.7% to 31.9%). Analysis of two post-HAART studies indicated a relapse rate of 19.2% (random effects; 95% CI?=?2.8% to 45.6%). Comparing the relapse rates between pre- and post-HAART studies were contrary to what might be expected based on known benefits of HAART therapy in this population. Nevertheless, cautious interpretation is necessary considering the heterogeneity of the included studies and a limited number of subjects receiving TMP-SMX reported in the post-HAART era. ? 2017 The Author(s).

Purpose: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and harms of LTBI treatment regimens aimed at preventing active TB among adults and children. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from indexing to 8 May 2017; clinical trial registries; and conference abstracts. No language restrictions were applied. Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials that evaluated human LTBI treatments and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified end points (hepatotoxicity and prevention of active TB). Data Extraction: 2 investigators independently extracted data from eligible studies and assessed study quality according to a standard protocol. Data Synthesis: The network meta-analysis of 8 new and 53 previously included studies showed that isoniazid regimens of 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.50 to 0.83]) or 12 to 72 months (OR, 0.50 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.62]), rifampicin-only regimens (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.85]), rifampicin-isoniazid regimens of 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.36 to 0.78]), rifampicin-isoniazid-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.35 [CrI, 0.19 to 0.61]), and rifampicin-pyrazinamide regimens (OR, 0.53 [CrI, 0.33 to 0.84]) were efficacious compared with placebo. Evidence existed for efficacy of weekly rifapentine-isoniazid regimens compared with no treatment (OR, 0.36 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.73]). No conclusive evidence showed that HIV status altered treatment efficacy. Limitation: Evidence was sparse for many comparisons and hepatotoxicity outcomes, and risk of bias was high or unknown for many studies.

We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases, included cohort studies, and excluded case reports and case series publications. We extracted sample sizes and the number of microcephaly cases from eight studies, which permitted a calculation of prevalence rates that are pooled in a random-effects model meta-analysis. We estimated the prevalence of microcephaly of 2.3% (95% CI = 1.0-5.3%) among all pregnancies. Limitations include mixed samples of women infected at different pregnancy times, since it is known that infection at the first trimester is associated with higher risk to congenital anomalies.

There is an urgent need for an effective and safe dengue vaccine to reduce morbidity and mortality in this high-risk population given the lack of dengue specific treatment at present. This review aims to determine the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of CYD-TDV vaccine in children. Methods: This is a systematic review including meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trial data from Embase, Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies that assessed CYD-TDV vaccine efficacy [(1 - RR)*100], safety (RR), and immunogenicity (weighted mean difference) in children were included in this study. Random effects model was employed to analyze patient-level data extracted from primary studies. Results: The overall efficacy of CYD-TDV vaccine was 54% (40-64), while serotype-specific efficacy was 77% (66-85) for DENV4, 75% (65-82) for DENV3, 50% (36-61) for DENV1, and 34% (14-49) for DENV2. 15% (-174-74) vaccine efficacy was obtained for the unknown serotype. Meta-analysis of included studies with longer follow-up time (25 months) revealed that CYD-TDV vaccine significantly increased the risk of injection site reactions (RR = 1.1: 1.04-1.17; p-value = 0.001). Immunogenicity (expressed as geometric mean titers) in descending order was 439.7 (331.7-547.7), 323 (247 - 398.7), 144.1 (117.9-170.2), and 105 (88.7-122.8) for DENV3, DENV2, DENV1, and DENV4, respectively. Conclusion: CYD-TDV vaccine is effective and immunogenic in children overall. Reduced efficacy of CYD-TDV vaccine against DENV2 notoriously known for causing severe dengue infection and dengue outbreaks cause for serious concern. Post hoc meta-analysis of long-term follow-up data (?25 months) from children previously vaccinated with CYD-TDV vaccine is needed to make a conclusion regarding CYD-TDV vaccine safety in children. However, CYD-TDV vaccine should be considered for use in regions where DENV2 is not endemic as currently there is no specific treatment for dengue infection. ? 2017 Malisheni, Khaiboullina, Rizvanov, Takah, Murewanhema and Bates."

Intestinal carriage is frequently under-investigated and its clinical impact ought to be defined a better way. Areas covered: This review and meta-analysis provide an updated overview of prevalence, characteristics and clinical significance of S. aureus intestinal carriage in different populations, both for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus strains. Expert commentary: Intestinal S. aureus carriage is documented with higher prevalence in children and in patients with S. aureus skin and soft tissue infections. This site of colonization was shown to be associated with a high risk of dissemination in the environment and with S. aureus infection. Intestinal carriage is frequently retrieved in nasal carriers, reflecting probably an association with a high bacterial load. Exclusive intestinal carriage present in one third of intestinal carriers can be associated with infection. Comparative genotyping analysis of different strains from nasal and extra-nasal sites of carriage, including the intestinal ones, in the same individuals, would allow a better comprehension of the pathophysiology of S. aureus endogenous infection. It could also permit to improve the prevention of these infections by decolonization of sites implicated in infection genesis. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of the perioperative use of probiotics and synbiotics on postoperative infections. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was postoperative infection rate. The secondary outcomes were length of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of antibiotic therapy, and mortality. The pooled outcomes were calculated using random effects models. Results: Twenty-eight RCTs involving 2511 patients were included in this systematic review. The incidence of infectious complications was lower among patients who received probiotics/synbiotics than among the controls (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.50), particularly regarding respiratory (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28-0.68), urinary tract (OR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16-0.55), and wound infections (OR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.80). The lengths of hospital stay (mean difference [MD] = -3.20; 95% CI, -4.87 to -1.54) and duration of antibiotic therapy (MD = -3.40; 95% CI, -4.67 to -2.13) were shorter for patients who received probiotics/synbiotics than for controls.

Moreover, recent studies reported inconsistent results. Thus, an updated meta-analysis was conducted to clarify the superiority of CH or PVI for prevention of SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgery. Methods From the inception to November 2016, Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane library were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which explored preoperative antisepsis schemes (CH or PVI) for prevention of SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgery. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects model. Furthermore, subgroup analysis, sensitive analysis, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) were applied to estimate whether overall pooled effect was enough credible and robust. Results Thirteen RCTs involving 6997 patients (3352 in CH and 3645 in PVI group) undergoing clean and clean-contaminated surgeries were included in our meta-analysis. Compared with PVI, preoperative CH antisepsis was associated with lower incidence of SSIs (RR, 0.70; 95%CI, 0.60¡V0.83, I2 = 0). Additionally, subgroup analysis, sensitive analysis, and TSA indicated that the current available evidence was reliable and robust. Conclusions CH should be more preferentially recommended for preoperative skin preparation as compared with PVI in clean and clean-contaminated surgery. ? 2017"

Lack of a comprehensive review, encouraged us to design a systematic review with meta-analysis approach to assess the prevalence of Leishmania infection in healthy blood donors. Methods For this purpose, 6 English databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Science Direct, EMBASE and CINAHL) were browsed from January 1990 to July 2016. Results Due to significant heterogeneity, the random-effects model was used (I2 = 98.04% and 94.68%, for serological and molecular methods, respectively). A total of 496 papers were found through searching in which 17,816 apparently healthy blood donors were examined for Leishmania infection. The weighted overall prevalence of Leishmania infection in this group was estimated 4% (95% CI = 2¡V7) and 8.7% (95% CI = 4.2¡V14.3) using serological and molecular methods, respectively. Conclusions High serological prevalence does not justify widespread donor screening. Leukodepletion filters would substantially decrease the risk of TTL, hence they are potentially proposed in endemic areas specifically for high-risk recipients. To better enlighten the epidemiological aspects of Leishmania infection in blood donors, it is suggested to perform high-level stewardship and more precise studies with regard to involved risk factors. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and other databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials, open-label, prospective cohort, and retrospective studies, and pooled analyses were included. Primary outcomes were induction (?12 wk) and maintenance (up to 56 wk) of remission and response. Secondary outcomes were severe adverse events, opportunistic infections, and development of antibodies to adalimumab. Results: Twenty-four of 1194 articles were eligible for inclusion. No significant difference was noted between regimens for induction of remission (odds ratio [OR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70-1.06; P = 0.19) and response (OR 1.01; 95% CI: 0.62-1.65; P = 0.96).

Current research suggests an increased fall-incidence in this population, with fall rates among middle-aged adults with HIV approximating that in seronegative elderly populations. Gait and postural balance rely on a complex interaction of the motor system, sensory control, and cognitive function. However, due to disease progression and complications related to ongoing inflammation, these systems may be compromised in people with HIV. Consequently, locomotor impairments may result that can contribute to higher-than-expected fall rates. The aim of this review was to synthesize the evidence regarding objective gait and balance impairments in adults with HIV, and to emphasize those which could contribute to increased fall risk. Methods: This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An electronic search of published observational studies was conducted in March 2016. Methodological quality was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Narrative synthesis of gait and balance outcomes was performed, and meta-analyses where possible. Results: Seventeen studies were included, with fair to low methodological quality. All studies used clinical tests for gait-assessment. Gait outcomes assessed were speed, initiation-time and cadence. No studies assessed kinetics or kinematics. Balance was assessed using both instrumented and clinical tests. Outcomes were mainly related to center of pressure, postural reflex latencies, and timed clinical tests. There is some agreement that adults with HIV walk slower and have increased center of pressure excursions and -long loop postural reflex latencies, particularly under challenging conditions. Conclusions: Gait and balance impairments exist in people with HIV, resembling fall-associated parameters in the elderly. Impairments are more pronounced during challenging conditions, might be associated with disease severity, are not influenced by antiretroviral therapy, and might not be associated with peripheral neuropathy. Results should be interpreted cautiously due to overall poor methodological quality and heterogeneity. Locomotor impairments in adults with HIV are currently insufficiently quantified. Future research involving more methodological uniformity is warranted to better understand such impairments and to inform clinical decision-making, including fall-prevention strategies, in this population. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

The objective of this meta-analysis was to compare the analgesic efficacy of both routes of administration during peripheral nerve block. The methodology followed the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia analysed according to the type of local anaesthetic administered (bupivacaine or ropivacaine). Secondary outcomes included cumulative opioid consumption in morphine i.v. equivalents, pain scores, and complication rates (neurological complications, infection, or hyperglycaemia). Eleven controlled trials, including 914 patients, were identified. The duration of analgesia was significantly increased with perineural dexamethasone vs systemic dexamethasone by a mean difference of 3h [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 4.5 h; P0.0001]. Subgroup analysis revealed that the duration of analgesia was increased by 21% with bupivacaine (mean difference: 4.0 h; 95% CI: 2.8, 5.2 h; P<0.00001) and 12% with ropivacaine (mean difference: 2.0 h; 95% CI: 0.5, 4.5 h; P0.11). The quality of evidence for our primary outcome was moderate according to the GRADE system. There were no significant differences in other secondary outcomes. No neurological complications or infections were reported. Glucose concentrations were not increased when dexamethasone was injected systemically, but this outcome was reported by only two trials. There is, therefore, moderate evidence that perineural dexamethasone combined with bupivacaine, but not ropivacaine, slightly prolongs the duration of analgesia, without an impact on other pain-related outcomes, when compared with systemic dexamethasone. Injection of perineural dexamethasone should be cautiously balanced in light of the off-label indication for this route of administration. ? The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press."

Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning on life-threatening complications of recombinant human BMPs (rhBMPs) in cervical spine fusion in 2008, their off-label use has been continued. This investigation aimed to review the evidence for the use of rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7 in anterior cervical spine fusions. Methods A comprehensive search was performed through Ovid (MEDLINE), PubMed, and Embase. The risk of bias assessment was according to the recommended criteria by the Cochrane Back and Neck group and MINORS (Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies). A wide array of radiographic and clinical outcomes including the adverse events were collated. Results Eighteen articles (1 randomized and 17 nonrandomized) were eligible for inclusion. The fusion rate was higher with use of rhBMP in most studies and our meta-analysis of the pooled data from 4782 patients confirmed this finding (odds ratio, 5.45; P < 0.00001). Altogether, the rhBMP and control groups were comparable in patient-reported outcomes. However, most studies tended to show a significantly higher incidence of overall complication rate, dysphagia/dysphonia, cervical swelling, readmission, wound complications, neurologic complications, and ossification. Conclusions Application of rhBMPs in cervical spine fusion yields a significantly higher fusion rate with similar patient-reported outcomes, yet increased risk of life-threatening complications. Thus, we do not recommend the use of rhBMP in anterior cervical fusions. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

More than 2.4 billion people worldwide lack access to improved sanitation facilities and almost one billion practice open defecation. We undertook systematic reviews and meta-analyses to compile the most recent evidence on the impact of sanitation on diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and nutritional status assessed using anthropometry. Methods and findings We updated previously published reviews by following their search strategy and eligibility criteria. We searched from the previous review's end date to December 31, 2015. We conducted meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect using random-effects models and conducted subgroup analyses to assess impact of different levels of sanitation services and to explore sources of heterogeneity. We assessed risk of bias and quality of the evidence from intervention studies using the Liverpool Quality Appraisal Tool (LQAT) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, respectively. A total of 171 studies met the review's inclusion criteria, including 64 studies not included in the previous reviews. Overall, the evidence suggests that sanitation is protective against diarrhea, active trachoma, some STH infections, schistosomiasis, and height-for-age, with no protective effect for other anthropometric outcomes. The evidence was generally of poor quality, heterogeneity was high, and GRADE scores ranged from very low to high. Conclusions This review confirms positive impacts of sanitation on aspects of health. Evidence gaps remain and point to the need for research that rigorously describes sanitation implementation and type of sanitation interventions. ? 2017 The Authors"

The only known ""cure"" for a VH is surgical repair. The aim of this study was to review systematically the published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the surgical care of VH. Method: A search of the Ovid, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was performed to obtain reports of RCTs on the use of mesh reinforcement in abdominal wall hernia repair. The outcomes assessed were hernia recurrence and surgical site infection (SSI). The overall quality of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). When feasible, based on assessment of heterogeneity, data were pooled and analyzed in a meta-analysis. Results: Of the 10,349 titles screened, 25 articles (23 studies) met the search criteria. Evidence indicates that mesh reinforcement in clean cases can decrease hernia recurrence (number needed to treat = 7.9) but increase risk of SSI (number needed to harm = 27.8). Placing mesh in the sublay position (as opposed to the onlay or underlay position) may decrease the risk of hernia recurrence and SSI. Conclusions: Mesh reinforcement is recommended for all VH repairs in a clean case (high grade of evidence). Sublay mesh location may result in fewer recurrences and SSIs than onlay or inlay placement, but further study is needed to confirm this hypothesis (moderate grade of evidence). ? 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017."

A total of 49 studies published during 2011¡V2016 with 63,554 participants were included in analysis. These studies were conducted in America (25), Europe (13), Africa (10), and Asia (1) with data collected during 1996¡V2014. Prevalence of hypertension and confidence interval was estimated and stratified by participants¡¦ age, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and calendar-years using random effects modeling. The quality assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool was high for all included studies. The estimated prevalence (95% confidence interval) of hypertension was 25.2% (21.2%, 29.6%) for the overall sample, 34.7% (27.4%, 42.8%) for ART-experienced, and 12.7% (7.4%, 20.8%) for ART-na?ve participants. The estimated prevalence was found increased with age and in studies conducted after 2010. Hypertension among PLWH shows an increasing trend and is associated with receiving ART and older age.

However, the benefits and adverse effects of programmable shunt valves have not been well assessed. Materials and methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing the efficacy and safety of programmable valves (PV) treatment for hydrocephalus were identified from electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library). The meta-analysis was performed with the fixed-effect model or random-effect model according to heterogeneity. Results Three RCTs and eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria including 2622 subjects. Compared with non-PV, PV treatment did not have a statistically significant effect on one-year shunt survival rate [relative risk (RR), 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84¡V1.35], Substantial heterogeneity was observed between studies (P = 0.09; I2 = 65%). PV administration significantly reduced revision rate (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45¡V0.69; I2 = 29%; P = 0.23) and over- or under-drainage complications rate (RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32¡V0.96). PV was not associated with increased rates of other adverse events, including overall complications rate, infection rate and catheter-related complications rate. Conclusions PV treatment is safe and may reduce the revision rate and over- or under-drainage complication rate, especially in patients aged less than 18 years with hydrocephalus. PV treatment is not associated with decreased overall complication rates in patients with hydrocephalus, but the trial sequential analysis indicate more studies are needed to confirm this result. ? 2017"

We aimed to analyze the efficacy of H.?pylori eradication regimens in Korea where clarithromycin resistance rate is high. Methods: We searched for all relevant randomized controlled trials published until November 2016 that investigated the efficacy of H.?pylori eradication therapies in Korea. A network meta-analysis was performed to calculate the direct and indirect estimates of efficacy among the eradication regimens. Results: Forty-three studies were identified through a systematic review, of which 34 studies, published since 2005, were included in the meta-analysis. Among 21 included regimens, quinolone-containing sequential therapy for 14?days (ST-Q-14) showed the highest eradication rate (91.4% [95% confidence interval [CI], 86.9%-94.4%] in the intention-to-treat [ITT] analysis). The eradication rate of the conventional triple therapy for 7?days, standard sequential therapy for 10?days, hybrid therapy for 10-14?days, and concomitant therapy for 10-14?days was 71.1% (95% CI, 68.3%-73.7%), 76.2% (95% CI, 72.8%-79.3%), 79.4% (95% CI, 75.5%-82.8%), and 78.3% (95% CI, 75.3%-80.9%), respectively, in the ITT analysis. In the network meta-analysis, ST-Q-14 showed a better comparative efficacy than the conventional triple therapy, standard sequential therapy, hybrid therapy, and concomitant therapy. In addition, tolerability of ST-Q-14 was comparable to those regimens.

Moreover, data on the mortality risk in candidates with a BMI: 30-34.9 and 35-39.9 kg/m2 (class I and class II obesity, respectively) are weak. Aim: To compare post-operative complications and mortality risks in all obese candidates vs candidates with a BMI: 18.5-29.9 (normal/overweight) assumed as controls. Methods: We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed, Scopus, Web-of-Science and article reference lists, restricted to the English language, and selected cohort studies analysing the following outcomes: all-causes mortality (at 30 days, 1-2-3-5 years), post-operative and cardiopulmonary complications, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Two reviewers independently extracted the studies data and a third one resolved discrepancies. Results: Twenty-four studies comprising 132 162 patients met the inclusion criteria. As compared to controls, mortality risk was increased at all time-periods (except at 3 years) for a BMI?40, at 30 days for a BMI: 30-34.9 and in none of the considered time-periods for a BMI: 35-39.9. Post-operative complications were significantly higher for a BMI&gt;30 and 30-34.9. Due to the shortage/absence of data, we evaluated cardiopulmonary complications, hospital and ICU length of stay only in the BMI?30 category. In these patients, only cardiopulmonary complications were increased as compared to controls. Conclusions: Morbid obesity has an impact on patients¡¦ survival after LT. However, since even a BMI&gt;30 increases post-transplant complications, new strategies should be included in the LT programme to favour weight loss in all obese candidates. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2017,Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery,10.1016/j.joms.2017.02.009,28288724,"Purpose The true benefit of autologous platelet concentrates (APCs) for enhancing the healing of postextraction sites is still a matter of debate, and in recent years several clinical trials have addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of an APC adjunct in the preservation of fresh extraction sockets. Materials and Methods An electronic search was performed on Medline, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Only controlled clinical trials or randomized clinical trials were included. Selected articles underwent risk-of-bias assessment. The outcomes were complications and adverse events, discomfort and quality of life, bone healing and remodeling assessed by histologic and radiographic techniques, and soft tissue healing. Results Thirty-three comparative studies were included. Nine articles had a parallel design and 24 had a split-mouth design. Twenty studies were considered to have a low risk of bias and 13 were considered to have a high risk. Overall, 1,193 teeth were extracted from 911 patients. Meta-analysis showed that soft tissue healing, probing depth at 3 months, and bone density at 1, 3, and 6 months were statistically better for the APC group. Qualitative analysis suggested that APCs might be associated with a decrease in swelling and trismus. However, no relevant difference among groups was found for probing depth at 1 month, incidence of alveolar osteitis, acute inflammation or infection, percentage of new bone, and indirect measurement of bone metabolism. Conclusion APCs should be used in postextraction sites to improve clinical and radiographic outcomes such as bone density and soft tissue healing and postoperative symptoms. The actual benefit of APCs on decreasing pain in extraction sockets is still not quantifiable. ? 2017 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons"

We conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether influenza vaccination protects against stroke. Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from database inception date to November 18, 2016, without language restrictions, to identify studies investigating the effect of influenza vaccination on subsequent risk of stroke. We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify the risk of stroke in overall and subgroup analyses and calculated a pooled OR for developing stroke with a 95% CI. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's rank correlation test. Results: Eleven studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. In a random-effects model, vaccinated individuals had a decreased risk of stroke compared with unvaccinated individuals (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.75-0.91; p < 0.001). The relationship between influenza vaccination and stroke risk remained robust in subgroup analyses.

Interpretation of efficacy of FMT for UC is complicated by differences among studies in blinding, FMT administration procedures, intensity of therapy and donor stool processing methods. Aim: To determine whether FMT is effective and safe for the induction of remission in active UC. Methods: Medline (Ovid), Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through February 2017. Original studies reporting remission rates following FMT for active UC were included. All study designs were included in the systematic review and a meta-analysis performed including only randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Results: There were 14 cohort studies and four RCTs that used markedly different protocols. In the meta-analysis of RCTs, clinical remission was achieved in 39 of 140 (28%) patients in the donor FMT groups compared with 13 of 137 (9%) patients in the placebo groups; odds ratio 3.67 (95% CI: 1.82-7.39, P<.01).

Randomised data on chemotherapy use and tolerance in comorbid patients are limited. We aimed to review the available literature regarding the use of chemotherapy in such patients. Methods: A systematic search of databases was performed for English-language articles evaluating the impact of comorbidity on chemotherapy use for early breast cancer. Comorbidity was assessed as a specific condition, summary count or index. Outcomes of interest were receipt of chemotherapy, change in chemotherapy delivery and occurrence of toxicity. Results: Sixty studies met inclusion criteria for systematic review. Thirty-three studies evaluated receipt of chemotherapy, with 19 reporting reduced treatment, particularly with higher levels of comorbidity. Meta-analysis of 10 eligible studies returned odds ratios (OR¡¦s) of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80¡V0.96] and 0.63 (95% CI 0.49¡V0.80) for receipt of chemotherapy by patients with comorbidity scores of 1?and ?2, respectively, compared with no comorbidity.

Successful PTX often results in a dramatic drop of parathyroid hormone level, relieves the patient from clinical symptoms, and reduces mortality. However, there is an ongoing debate on the optimal surgical treatment of SHPT. Currently, no clinical guidelines or trials have definitely answered the question of whether Total Parathyroidectomy (TPTX) is superior or equal to Total Parathyroidectomy with Autotransplantation (TPTX + AT). Objective The aims of the study were to compare the efficacy of two different surgical procedures and to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for the treatment of SHPT.

Compared with TPTX + AT, patients in the TPTX group had lower rates of ¡§recurrence¡¨ (OR = 0.20; 95%CI, 0.11¡V0.38; P < 0.01), ¡§recurrence or persistence¡¨ (OR = 0.18; 95%CI, 0.10¡V0.33; P < 0.01), ¡§reoperation due to recurrence or persistence¡¨ (OR = 0.17; 95%CI, 0.06¡V0.54; P = 0.002), and shorter ¡§operative time¡¨ (WMD = ?17.30; 95%CI, ?30.53 to ?4.06; P < 0.05), except for a higher risk of ¡§hypoparathyroidism¡¨ (OR = 2.97; 95%CI, 1.09¡V8.08; P = 0.01). However, none of the patients had developed permanent hypocalcemia or adynamic bone disease. No significant difference was found for ¡§symptomatic improvement¡¨, ¡§complications¡¨, ¡§drug requirements¡¨, and ¡§hospital stay¡¨ (P > 0.05). Conclusion The findings indicate that TPTX is superior to TPTX + AT, while referring to the rate of recurrent SHPT. However, this conclusion needs to be tested in large-scale confirmatory trials. TPTX seems to be a feasible alternative therapeutic option for the surgical treatment of refractory SHPT. ? 2017"

Intravenous (IV) enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with laronidase is currently used for treating patients with MPS I. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of IV laronidase for MPS I. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed by searching the ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Library databases, limited to clinical trials published until December 31, 2016. The first inclusion criterion was being a randomized controlled trial (RCT). If < five RCTs were identified, open-label and nonrandomized trials, controlled or uncontrolled (quasi-experimental), including ? five patients, and evaluating relevant outcomes defined a priori, would also be included. For meta-analysis, primary inferences were based on random-effects models. Assessment of article quality was performed in accordance with the GRADE criteria. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to examine the risk of bias for RCTs. Results: The selection phase retrieved 632 articles. During the first phase of selection, 158 had the abstract or full text read for assessment of eligibility, of which nine (two RCTs) were included for qualitative synthesis. Four papers were included in the meta-analysis, which was performed for the following outcomes: occurrence of treatment-emergent or infusion-related adverse events (65%; 95%CI 53, 76), mild in most cases; development of IgG antibodies to laronidase (88%; 95%CI 67, 100); apnea-hypopnea index (not significant¡XNS), urinary glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) [mean change -65.5 £gg/mg creatinine (95%CI -68.8, -62.3)], liver size [mean change -31.03% (95%CI -36.1, -25.9)], left ventricular mass index (LVMI) [mean change -1.8 (95%CI -2.32, -0.25)], and distance covered in the 6-minute walk test (NS). Among the outcomes not included in meta-analysis, we found evidence for benefit of laronidase only on shoulder flexion. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that IV laronidase effectively reduces urinary GAGs excretion, hepatomegaly and LVMI, and can improve shoulder flexion in MPS I patients.

However, HPV prevalence in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not previously been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to estimate the HPV prevalence in patients diagnosed with NPC and to assess the potential etiological significance of HPVs. The goal of this study was to quantitatively summarize published data to evaluate the effects of HPV infection on the pathogenesis of NPC. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Science Direct, Ovid, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Library databases, as well as several Chinese databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Chong Qing VIP, Chinese Wan Fang and China Biology Medicine databases) were searched to identify all relevant studies. For case-control studies, the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. For studies providing World Health Organization (WHO) classifications and HPV subtypes, the corresponding pooled ORs and 95% CIs were also calculated. The Stata 12.0 software was used for the Meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis, involving a total of 1748 cases of NPC and 289 control cases. The pooled HPV prevalence was 21% among all of the NPC patients (95% CI: 17%, 26%; I2=89.4%; p&lt;0.001). A pooled OR of 4.77 (95% CI: 1.69, 13.45) was calculated based on the 11 case-control studies (I2=69.7%; p&lt;0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of HPV was higher in cases outside of China than in cases from regions in China (23% vs 19%; I2=95.0%; p&lt;0.001). The HPV prevalence was 33.6% (24/66) in patients with a WHO type I NPC, and 27.9% (115/402) in patients with a WHO type II/III NPC. The pooled OR of 2.638 (95% CI: 0.984, 7.072) was not statistically significant. In addition, the pooled prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 were 10.5% and 1.9%, respectively, and the pooled OR was 2.26 (95% CI: 1.28, 3.99).

We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of reduced frequency of clinic visits and drug dispensing on patient outcomes. Methods: As part of the development process of the World Health Organization antiretroviral (ARV) guidelines, we systematically searched medical literature databases for publications up to 30 August 2016. Information was extracted on trial characteristics, patient characteristics and the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, treatment adherence, retention, patient and provider acceptability, cost and patients exiting the programme. When feasible, conventional pairwise metaanalyses were conducted. Results and discussion: Of 6443 identified citations, 21 papers, pertaining to 16 studies, were included in this review, with 11 studies contributing to analyses. Although analyses were feasible, they were limited by the sparse evidence base, despite the importance of the research area, and relatively low quality. Comparative analyses of eight studies reporting on frequency of clinic visits showed that less frequent clinic visits led to higher odds of being retained in care (odds ratio [OR]: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.21-2.99). No differences were found with respect to viral failure, morbidity or mortality; however, most estimates were favourable to reduced clinic visits. Reduced frequency of ARVs pick-ups showed a trend towards better retention (OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 0.62-6.04). Strategies using community support tended to have better outcomes; however, their implementation varied, particularly by location. External validity may be questionable. Conclusions: Our systematic review suggests that reduction of clinical visits (and likely ARVs pick-ups) may improve clinical outcomes, and that they are a viable option to relieve health systems and reduce burden of care for PLHIV. Strategies aimed at reducing clinic visits or drug refill services should focus on stable patients who are virally suppressed, tolerant to their drug regimen and fully adherent. These strategies may be critical to the current changes taking place in HIV treatment policy; thus, due to the data limitations, further high quality research is needed to inform policy and programmatic interventions. ? 2017 Mutasa-Apollo T et al."

Methods: Trials comparing B-TURP and HoLEP were identified systematically using Pubmed, Embase, CNKI, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Primary outcomes were the peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual volume (PVR) and international prostate symptom score (IPSS). Secondary outcomes were operation time, irrigation duration, catheterization duration, resected tissue and complications. Results: Four trials assessing B-TURP and HoLEP were considered eligible for Meta-analysis, including three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective study. There was no statistically significant difference between B-TURP and HoLEP in terms of Qmax, IPSS, PVR at 3¡V6 months follow-up, operation duration, catheterization duration, resected tissue and complications (p &gt; 0.05). HoLEP was associated with a significantly shorter irrigation time as compared with B-TURP (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Both B-TURP and HoLEP are safe and minimally invasive techniques that are similar in terms of symptomatic relief, although these findings need further validation in larger RCTs involving larger numbers of patients and over a longer follow-up duration for B-TURP or HoLEP before a new gold standard procedure emerges for surgical treatment of BPH. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Since both viruses are individually known to cause the pathologies mentioned above, co-infection with both HBV and HCV would be expected to be linked with higher morbidity as well as mortality and impact healthcare resource utilisation. Precise estimate of the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection would be needed to formulate policy decisions and plan communal health interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis, therefore, aims to understand the prevalence of HBV and HCV co-infection in India based on the available literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, primary studies reporting the prevalence of HBV/HCV co-infection in India were retrieved through searches conducted in PubMed, Google SCHOLAR, Medline, Cochrane Library, WHO reports, Indian and International journals online. All online searches were conducted between December 2016 and February 2017. Meta-analysis was carried out using StatsDirect statistical software. Thirty studies published between 2000 and 2016 conducted across six regions of India were included in this review. The pooled HBV/HCV co-infection prevalence rate across the thirty studies was 1.89% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.2%-2.4%). A high heterogeneity was observed between prevalence estimates.

Methods PubMed? was searched, from inception to September 2015, to identify population-based studies reporting the prevalence and/or incidence of H. pylori infection in both sexes. Odds ratios (OR) or data to compute them were extracted; adjusted estimates were preferred, whenever available. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used to compute summary estimates and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), separately for children and adults. Results Among a total of 244 studies, mostly cross-sectional, male sex was associated with a greater prevalence of H. pylori infection, both in children (102 studies, OR?=?1.06, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.12, I2?=?43.7%) and adults (169 studies, OR?=?1.12, 95%CI: 1.09, 1.15, I2?=?68.5%). An underrepresentation of studies showing a negative association between male sex and infection was observed (Egger's test: p?=?0.006). Conclusions Although further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which sex may influence the acquisition and/or persistence of infection, our results support a small contribution of sex differences in the prevalence of infection to the male predominance of H. pylori-related outcomes, including gastric cancer. ? 2017 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l."

Results: Four studies met our eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. We found a higher risk of osteoporosis among patients with chronic HCV with OR of 1.65 (95% CI: 0.98-2.77). Sensitivity analysis including only studies with higher quality yielded a higher OR, and the result was statistically significant (OR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.03-5.93). Conclusions: Our study demonstrated a higher risk of osteoporosis among HCV-infected patients. Further studies are required to clarify how this risk should be addressed in clinical practice. ? 2017 Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow."

Complications in the presence of a VPS have been reported, but a clear association has not been established. Methods PRISMA guidelines were used to perform a literature search using PubMed to identify articles that published the complication rates associated with staged or simultaneous cranioplasty and VPS placement. From these event rates, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of complications were calculated. Data were pooled using the Mantel¡VHaenszel method. The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines were used to assess the quality of individual articles and studies. The Newcastle¡VOttawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias in studies. Results Of the 30 papers reviewed for complications in the presence and absence of a VPS, 7 studies, with a total of 1635 patients, were eligible for meta-analysis. Overall rates of complications (n = 1635; OR, 9.75; 95% CI, 4.8¡V20.1), infection (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 2.2¡V10.7), and bone resorption (OR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.9¡V23.0) were increased when a VPS was placed at the time of cranioplasty. Simultaneous procedures were associated with increased complication rates (n = 283; OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.3¡V8.2) compared with staged procedures. Conclusions Cranioplasty in the presence of a VPS is associated with a higher rate of overall complications, including infection and bone resorption. Performing cranioplasty and VPS placement in the same operation is associated with an increased rate of complications compared with staged procedures. Surgeons should consider staging these procedures when possible and counsel patients about these risks. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

We examined trends in sexual risk behaviour in the general population of sub-Saharan African countries 1999¡V2015. Methods: We systematically reviewed scientific literature of sexual behaviour and reviewed trends in Demographic and Health Surveys. A meta-analysis on four indicators of sexual risk behaviour was performed: unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, commercial sex and prevalence of sexually transmitted infections. Results: Only two peer-reviewed studies met our inclusion criteria, while our review of DHS data spanned 18 countries and 16 years (1999¡V2015). We found conflicting trends in sexual risk behaviour. Reported unprotected sex decreased consistently across the 18 countries, for both sexes. In contrast, reporting multiple partners was decreasing over the period 1999 to the mid-2000s, yet has been consistently increasing thereafter. Similar trends were found for reported sexually transmitted infections and commercial sex (men only). Conclusions: In conclusion, we found no clear evidence of behavioural disinhibition due to expanded access to ART in sub-Saharan Africa. Substantial increases in condom use coincided with increases in reported multiple partners, commercial sex and sexually transmitted infections, especially during the period of ART scale-up. Further research is needed into how these changes might affect HIV transmission. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

However, it is unclear if one material is more beneficial than the others in terms of wound complications and fluid handling capacity. Research questions: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing alternative wound dressing materials for the post-operative management of wounds following THA and TKA with respect to (1) incidence of wound complications including infection and (2) fluid handling capacity. Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing alternative dressing materials, for post-operative management of wounds following TKA and THA were included in the review. Databases searched included the MEDLINE and the EMBASE from inception to February 2017. Two authors performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Where levels of clinical and statistical heterogeneity permitted, data were pooled for meta-analysis. Results: Twelve randomized trials with data for the primary outcome were identified. Data were available for meta-analysis for two comparisons. Wounds managed with film dressings (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21¡V0.57) or with hydrofiber dressings (odds ratio, 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20¡V0.40) were significantly less likely to have wound complications than those managed with passive dressings. There was no evidence that any dressing significantly reduced surgical-site infection rates compared with any other dressing. Hydrofibre dressings showed better fluid handling capacity than passive dressings in terms of mean number of dressing changes (mean difference 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15¡V2.57) and number of patients requiring early dressing change (odds ratio, 8.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.68¡V15.83). Conclusion: The evidence available in the current literature suggests that advanced dressings such as film and Hydrofibre dressings have fewer wound complications and better fluid handling capacity. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether the use of these advanced dressings reduce periprosthetic joint infection. ? 2017, SICOT aisbl."

Materials and Methods: We searched systematically for randomized controlled clinical trials on treatment of RA with different biological response modifiers, followed by a systematic review with meta-analysis. Trials were searched from MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases. The following safety parameters reported in the selected trials were analyzed: number of patients suffering any adverse event (AE), withdrawal due to AEs, serious AE (SAEs), infections, serious infections, infusion reactions, injection site reactions, malignancies, and overall mortality. Undesired effects were estimated using combined relative risks (RR) and number needed to harm (NNH). Heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochrane's Q and I2 statistics. Results: According to inclusion criteria, a total of 43 trials (20,504 patients) were included in this study. A total number of AEs were found more with abatacept (RR: 1.05, NNH: 21.93). Withdrawal due to AEs was found with all biologicals, highest with anakinra (RR: 3.48, NNH: 15.70). Patients receiving newer tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, golimumab, were more likely to develop SAEs (RR: 2.44, NNH: 12.72) and infection (RR: 1.25, NNH: 10.09), and in certolizumab, serious infections (RR: 2.95, NNH: 37.31) were found more. Infusion reaction develops more with rituximab (RR: 1.52, NNH: 8.47). Etanercept showed the highest risk to develop infusion site reaction (RR: 5.33, NNH: 4.65). Biologicals showed no difference to their control counterparts in malignancy and mortality risk. Conclusion: This meta-analysis helps to clarify some frequently encountered and unanswered safety questions of different biological response modifiers, a new class of drugs, in the clinical care of RA patients."

However, the results remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effects of hyaluronan nasal dressing on clinical outcome after ESS. Methods: Medical literature data bases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that assessed the effect of hyaluronan nasal dressing on the outcome after ESS were included. The results were searched and data were extracted and assessed for quality. The primary outcome was reepithelization. Meta-analysis was performed by using the random-effect model. Results: Four RCTs, which involved 352 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with control intervention, hyaluronan nasal dressing significantly promoted reepithelization (odds ratio [OR] 3.18 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.33-7.59]; p = 0.009) and reduced edema (OR 0.45 [95% CI, 0.23- 0.89]; p = 0.02) after ESS.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare IMN with SHS in AO/OTA 31-A2 trochanteric fractures. Material and methods Databases including PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase were searched to identify RCTs published before December 2016, which compared IMN with SHS for intraoperative and postoperative outcomes in AO/OTA 31-A2 trochanteric fractures. Results A total of 909 patients from six RCTs were subjected to the meta-analysis. The results showed that the IMN group was associated with less operative blood loss, leg shortening, wound infections, length of hospital stay, and days to mobilization with walking aids and also yielded a higher Parker score as compared to the SHS group. No significant difference was seen in the other parameters including operative details, fracture fixation complications, postoperative complications, and 1 year mortality. Conclusion IMN fixation was found to be the superior treatment of choice for 31-A2 trochanteric fractures as compared with SHS fixation in our meta-analysis. The adverse effects appeared comparable between the two groups. However, due to the variations in the included studies, more large-sample, measures-unified, and high-quality RCTs are needed to validate these conclusions. ? 2017"

Methods: The electronic databases including Embase, PubMed and Cochrane library were searched to identify relevant studies published from the time of the establishment of these databases up to January 2017. The primary outcomes were total blood loss, requirement of transfusion (rate and amount), and operation time. The secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and postoperative wound infection. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software. Results: A total of five studies involving 500 patients (261 patients in the BS group and 239 in the control group) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results revealed that application of bipolar sealer could decrease the total blood loss in spine surgery [WMD?=??467.49, 95% CI (685.47 to ?249.51); p?&lt;?0.05; I2?=?91%]. Compared with standard electrocautery, bipolar sealer was associated with lower rates of need for transfusion [OR?=?0.30, 95% CI (0.16¡V0.55), p?&lt;?0.05; I2?=?0%].

Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that bipolar sealer is superior to standard electrocautery with less blood loss, shorter operation time and less transfusion requirement. There is no significant difference between both groups regarding length of hospitalization and wound infection. Hence, bipolar sealer is recommended in spine surgery. Because of the limitation of our study, more well-designed RCTs with large sample are required to provide further evidence of safety and efficacy between bipolar sealer and standard electrocautery in the treatment of spinal disease. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Arteriotomy closure devices (ACDs) enable minimally invasive access to the common femoral artery (CFA). The objective of this review was to assess the differences between ACDs and surgical cut down (SCD) of the CFA regarding the number of complications, duration of surgery (DOS), and hospital length of stay (HLOS). Design A systematic literature search with predefined search terms was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (2000¡V2016). All studies reporting on ACD and SCD for a puncture of the CFA of at least 12 French (Fr.) were assessed for eligibility. Methods Included were randomised controlled trials and cohort studies comparing both techniques. Patient characteristics, exclusion criteria, and conversion rates were evaluated. Complications, DOS, and HLOS were compared. Materials A total of 17 studies were included for meta-analysis, describing 7889 vascular access sites; four studies were randomised trials, two studies reported from a prospective database, and 11 studies reported retrospective cohorts. Results ACD was associated with fewer post-operative seromas (odds ratio [OR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06¡V0.35), less wound dehiscence (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.03¡V0.78), and fewer surgical site infections (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23¡V0.63). Post-operative pseudoaneurysms were significantly more common in the ACD group (OR 3.83, 95% CI 1.55¡V9.44). In five of 17 studies, DOS and HLOS were not reduced in the ACD group. When all studies reporting a mean DOS and/or HLOS were compared in a non-parametric analysis, neither was significantly different. Conclusion This meta-analysis favours ACD regarding the number of wound complications compared with SCD in endovascular aneurysm repair, thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair, and transcatheter aortic valve repair. Treatment duration (DOS and HLOS) was not reduced in ACD. The differences are of limited clinical significance and with this equivocal quality of evidence, the ACD may be considered safe for CFA access in suitable patients. ? 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery"

Despite the knowledge that CVD is one of the leading causes of non-AIDS related premature mortality in people living with HIV (PLWH), relatively little attention has been attributed to sedentary behavior in this population. The aims of this meta-analysis were to (a) establish the pooled mean time spent sedentary, (b) investigate predictors of sedentary levels, and (c) explore differences with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methods: Two independent authors searched major databases until August 2016. A random effects meta-analysis was performed. Results: Across 6 unique cross-sectional studies, including 9 sedentary levels, there were 523 (292 men) PLWH (age range = 37 to 58 years). PLWH spent 533 min/day (95% CI = 466 to 599) engaging in sedentary behavior. There was a trend (P = .07) for higher levels of sedentary behavior in self-report measures (551 min, 95% CI = 543 to 560, N = 4) than in objective sedentary behavior time (505 min, 95% CI = 498 to 512, N = 3). The time PLWH spend engaging in sedentary behavior is among the highest levels reported in the literature. Conclusions: Given that sedentary behavior is an independent predictor of CVD, future lifestyle interventions specifically targeting the prevention of sedentary behavior in PLWH are warranted. ? 2017 Human Kinetics, Inc."

Materials and methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out. A search between January 1995 and February 2015 was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Inclusion criteria were: 1) original scientific studies about smokefree legislation, 2) Data before and after legislation were collected, and 3) Impact on respiratory and sensory outcomes were assessed. Paired reviewers independently carried out the screening of titles and abstracts, data extraction from full-text articles, and methodological quality assessment. Results: A total number of 1606 papers were identified. 50 papers were selected, 26 were related to symptoms (23 concerned workers). Most outcomes presented significant decreases in the percentage of people suffering from them, especially in locations with comprehensive measures and during the immediate post-ban period (within the first six months). Four (50%) of the papers concerning pulmonary function reported some significant improvement in expiratory parameters. Significant decreases were described in 13 of the 17 papers evaluating asthma hospital admissions, and there were fewer significant reductions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions (range 1¡V36%) than for asthma (5¡V31%). Six studies regarding different respiratory diseases showed discrepant results, and four papers about mortality reported significant declines in subgroups. Low bias risk was present in 23 (46%) of the studies.

Methods Potentially relevant studies were identified from electronic databases including Medline, PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Library. Patients undergoing primary total knee and hip arthroplasty were included in our studies, with an experimental group that received combined intravenous and topical application of tranexamic acid and a control group that received a single application of tranexamic acid or normal saline. The primary outcomes were total blood loss, hemoglobin decline and transfusion requirements. The secondary outcomes were length of stay, operation time and tranexamic acid-related adverse effects, such as superficial infection, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Modified Jadad scores were used to assess the quality of the included randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The data was pooled using RevMan 5.3. After testing for heterogeneity across studies, the data were aggregated using random-effects modeling when appropriate. We have registered the trial at http://www.researchregistry.com. Results Six RCTs that included 704 patients met the inclusion criteria. The present meta-analysis indicated significant differences existed in the total blood loss (MD = ?134.65, 95% CI: ?191.66 to ?77.64, P < 0.0001), postoperative hemoglobin level (MD = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.10, P < 0.0001), drainage volume (MD = ?40.19, 95% CI: ?55.95 to ?24.43, P < 0.00001) and transfusion rate (RD = ?0.07, 95% CI: ?0.11 to ?0.03, P = 0.0004) between groups. Conclusion Combined administration of tranexamic acid in total knee and hip arthroplasty was associated with significantly reduced total blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin decline, drainage volume, and transfusion requirements. Based on the limitations of current meta-analysis, well-designed, high-quality RCTs with long-term follow-up are still required. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

However, the safety of lysine analogues in cancer patients remains in question due to a potential risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The objective of our review is to investigate safety and efficacy of lysine analogue administration in the patients with cancer. Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Library were searched from inception to June, 2016. Reference lists of retrieved studies were searched to identify additional publications. We included randomized clinical trials in adult cancer patients for which a lysine analogue was administered for the purpose of blood loss reduction. Abstract and full-text selection as well as data extraction and risk of bias assessment was done by 2 independent reviewers. The primary outcome was venous thromboembolic events. Secondary outcomes were other adverse events, blood transfusion, and blood loss. Overall, 11studies involving 1177 patients evaluated at least one of the primary or secondary outcomes. Nine studies evaluated the effects of tranexamic acid, one study evaluated the effects of aminocaproic acid and one study examined both agents. No increased risk of venous thromboembolism was observed for patients who received lysine analogues compared to control (Peto OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.26-1.28). The administration of a lysine analogue significantly decreased both transfusion risk (pooled RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.34-0.80) and blood loss (SMD ?1.57, 95% CI ?2.21 to ?0.92). Among 3 eligible studies, no increased risk was observed for mortality (Peto OR 1.01; 95% CI 0.14-7.18) or infection (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.27-1.27). The safety of lysine analogues in cancer patients has not been extensively studied. Based on the available literature, lysine analogue use has not been associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism or other adverse events, while being effective in reducing blood loss and subsequent transfusion. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc."

The true burden of LTBI in Africa is not known. Early modelling studies estimate that over 33% of the world's population is infected with latent tuberculosis. We propose conducting a systematic review and a meta-analysis to evaluate the burden and risk factors of LTBI in Africa reported in studies from 2000 to 2017. Methods and analysis We will include cross-sectional studies, cohort studies and case-control studies estimating either tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) confirmed prevalence of LTBI and associated risk factors among people in African countries. A comprehensive search of relevant literature will be conducted on electronic databases using common and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms for LTBI, and an African search filter. Risk of bias will be evaluated by assessing all qualifying full-text articles for quality and eligibility using a quality score assessment tool. Standardised data extraction will be carried out after which prevalence estimates will be pooled using random-effects models in Stata V.13. Where there is sufficient data, subgroup meta-analyses will be conducted by risk factors including participant's age group, occupation, location and HIV status. This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols 2015 Statement. Ethics and dissemination No ethical issues were foreseen given that this was a protocol for a systematic review of published studies. The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. ?

We performed a systematic quantitative review on characteristics of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) included in meta-Analyses (MAs) on non-skeletal effects of Vitamin D supplementation. Methods and findings We identified systematic reviews (SR) reporting summary data in terms of MAs of RCTs on selected non-skeletal outcomes. For each outcome, we summarized the results from available SRs and scrutinized included RCTs for a number of predefined characteristics. We identified 54 SRs including data from 210 RCTs. Most MAs as well as the individual RCTs reported null-findings on risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, weight-loss, and malignant diseases. Beneficial effects of Vitamin D supplementation was reported in 1 of 4 MAs on depression, 2 of 9 MAs on blood pressure, 3 of 7 MAs on respiratory tract infections, and 8 of 12 MAs on mortality. Most RCTs have primarily been performed to determine skeletal outcomes, whereas non-skeletal effects have been assessed as secondary outcomes. Only one-Third of the RCTs had low level of 25OHD as a criterion for inclusion and a mean baseline 25OHD level below 50 nmol/L was only present in less than half of the analyses . Conclusions Published RCTs have mostly been performed in populations without low 25OHD levels. The fact that most MAs on results from RCTs did not show a beneficial effect does not disprove the hypothesis suggested by observational findings on adverse health outcomes of low 25OHD levels. ? 2017 Rejnmark et al.

Evidence from a systematic review of discordant meta-analyses,2017,International Journal of Surgery,10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.05.069,28578086,"Objective An increasing number of meta-analyses comparing intramedullary fixation (IF) with plate fixation (PF) for displaced midshaft clavicle fracture have been reported, but the inconsistent results obtained might confuse decision-making. We systematically reviewed discordant meta-analyses for assisting the decision-maker in interpreting and selecting amongst discordant meta-analyses and providing surgical recommendations for displaced midshaft clavicle fracture according to currently best available evidence. Methods Meta-analyses on IF and PF for displaced midshaft clavicle fracture were identified by searching PubMed, Emabase and the Cochrane Library. A review of meta-analysis quality and data extraction was individually conducted by two reviewers. The meta-analysis providing the best available evidence was identified using the Jadad decision algorithm. Results Nine studies were included, five of which were of Level-II evidence and four of which were of Level-III evidence. These meta-analyses scored from 6 to 10 according to the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews instrument. With respect to the Jadad decision algorithm, the best meta-analysis was chosen depending upon publication characteristics and methodology of primary studies, language restrictions, and whether data on individual patients were analysed. A meta-analysis incorporating more randomised controlled trials was eventually selected. The best available evidence indicated that the differences between IF and PF were not significant in terms of shoulder function or the rate of treatment failure. However, IF significantly decreased the operative time and the rate of non-operative complications, especially the rate of infection. Conclusions Based on the best available evidence, IF may be superior to PF for treating displaced midshaft clavicle fracture. ? 2017"

Recently, some studies have reported that PPIs can alter the gastric mucosal architecture; however, the relationship remains controversial. This meta-analysis study was designed to quantify the association between long-term PPI administration and gastric atrophy. Materials and Methods: A PubMed search was conducted to identify studies using the keywords proton pump inhibitors or PPI and gastric atrophy or atrophic gastritis; the timeframe of publication searched was up to May 2016. Heterogeneity among studies was tested with the Q test; odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. P values were calculated by I2 tests and regarded as statistically significant when &lt;0.05. Results: We identified 13 studies that included 1465 patients under long-term PPI therapy and 1603 controls, with a total gastric atrophy rate of 14.50%.

However, there remains limited data that compares its long-term complication rate to autologous grafts and titanium mesh implants. To compare complication and implant failure rates after PEEK, autologous and titanium mesh cranioplasties, the authors of this study conducted a systematic review using the PubMed database. Studies that contained outcome data on complication rates of PEEK cranioplasty patients and studies that compared outcomes of patients who underwent PEEK cranioplasties versus other materials were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios using the Mantel¡VHaenszel method were used for analysis. Fifteen articles, comprised of 183 PEEK cranioplasty patients were included. Of these patients, 15.3% developed post-operative complications and 8.7% experienced implant failure requiring reoperation. Patients who underwent cranioplasties with PEEK implants had 0.130 times the odds of developing post-operative complications (P = 0.065) and 0.574 times the odds of implant failure compared to patients with autologous bone graft cranioplasties (P = 0.629). Patients who had undergone PEEK cranioplasties had 0.127 times the odds of developing post-op complications (P = 0.360) and 0.170 times the odds of implant failure compared to individuals who had undergone titanium mesh cranioplasties (P = 0.168).

Given its widespread use, it is important to identify the outcomes associated with ICD use in patients with HCM. The present paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the rates of appropriate and inappropriate interventions, mortality, and device complications in HCM patients with an ICD. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on 27 studies reporting outcomes and complications after ICD implantation in patients with HCM. ICD interventions, device complications, and mortality were extracted for analysis. Results: A total of 3,797 patients with HCM and ICD implantation were included (mean age, 44.5 years; 63% male), of which 83% of patients had an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. The cardiac mortality was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.3) per year and non-cardiac mortality was 0.8% (95% CI: 0.6-1.2) per year. Annualized appropriate intervention rate was 4.8% and annualized inappropriate intervention was 4.9%. The annual incidence of lead malfunction, lead displacement and infection was 1.4%, 1.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. Conclusions: ICD use in patients with HCM produces low rates of cardiac and non-cardiac mortality, and an appropriate intervention rate of 4.8% per year. However, moderate rates of inappropriate intervention and device complications warrant careful patient selection in order to optimize the risk to benefit ratio in this select group of patients. ?

Although current guidelines exist on first-line management, evidence for second-line therapy in treatment-refractory patients is lacking. Our aim was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of second-line treatments used in this population. Methods: Electronic and manual searches were used to identify potential studies for inclusion. Studies were selected based on reported response rates to second-line therapies in children who failed response to prednisone and azathioprine. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by 2 reviewers. Meta-analysis using weighted estimate of response rates at 6 months was performed for each treatment option. Heterogeneity was assessed. Results: Fifteen studies of 76 pediatric patients with AIH were included in the review. Overall response rates at 6 months were estimated as 36% for mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (N=34, 95% confidence interval [CI] (16-57)), and 50% for tacrolimus (N=4, 95% CI (0-100%)) and 83% for cyclosporine (N=15, 95% CI (66%-100%)). Adverse effects were most frequent with cyclosporine (64% experiencing at least 1 adverse effect) followed by tacrolimus (54%) and MMF (48%). Pooled estimates of adverse events were 78% for cyclosporine (95% CI (54%-100%)), 42% for tacrolimus (95% CI (0%-85%)) and 45% for MMF (95% CI (25%-68%)). Sensitivity analyses were not performed due to small sample size. Conclusions: Cyclosporine had the highest response rate at 6 months in children with standard-treatment-refractory AIH; however, it also had the highest rate of adverse events.

Various insulin regimens are used in the inpatient diabetes management of non-critically ill patients. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of basal-bolus insulin therapy (BBI) by summarizing evidence from studies of BBI versus sliding scale insulin therapy (SSI) in the management of hospitalized non-critically ill type 2 diabetes patients. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for studies comparing BBI therapy with SSI therapy in hospitalized non-critically ill patients with type 2 diabetes. Primary outcome was mean daily blood glucose (BG) during admission. Secondary outcomes were incidence of hypoglycemia and length of hospital stay. Results of included randomized controlled trials (RCT) were pooled and meta-analysed to provide estimates of the efficacy of BBI therapy. Five RCTs and seven observational studies were included in the review. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed significantly lower mean daily BG with BBI than SSI. Mean difference in daily BG between the two regimens ranged from 14 to 29 mg/dl. BBI therapy was associated with increased risk of mild hypoglycemia (BG ? 70 mg/dl, RR 5.75; 95% CI 2.79-11.83), (BG ? 60 mg/dl, RR 4.21; 95% CI 1.61-11.02) compared with SSI therapy. There was no difference in risk of severe hypoglycemia (BG ? 40 mg/dl) and no difference in mean length of stay. In conclusion, basal-bolus insulin in the inpatient diabetes management results in significantly lower mean daily BG than sliding scale insulin but is associated with increased risk of mild hypoglycemia.

To synthesize the evidence and provide the hierarchies of different circumcisions for phimosis and redundant prepuce, we performed an overall network meta-analysis (NMA) based on their comparative efficacy and safety. Material and methods Electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Wan Fang, VIP, CNKI and CBM database were researched from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for redundant prepuce or phimosis. We conducted the direct and indirect comparisons by aggregate data drug information system (ADDIS) software. Moreover, consistency models were applied to assess the differences among the male circumcision practices, and the ranks based on probabilities of intervention for the different endpoints were performed. Node-splitting analysis was used to test inconsistency. Results Eighteen RCTs were included with 6179 participants. Compared with the conventional circumcision(CC), two new styles of circumcisions, the disposable circumcision suture device(DCSD) and Shang Ring circumcision(SRC), provided significantly shorter operation time[DCSD: standardized mean difference (SMD) = -20.60, 95% credible interval(CI) (?23.38, ?17.82); SRC: SMD = ?19.16, 95%CI (?21.86, ?16.52)], shorter wound healing time [DCSD:SMD = ?4.19, 95%CI (?8.24,-0.04); SRC: SMD = 4.55, 95%CI (1.62, 7.57); ] and better postoperative penile appearance [DCSD: odds ratios odds ratios (OR) = 11.42, 95%CI (3.60, 37.68); SRC: OR = 3.85,95%CI (1.29, 12.79)]. Additionally, DCSD showed a lower adverse events rate than other two treatments. However, no significant difference was shown in all surgeries for 24 h postoperative pain score. Node-splitting analysis showed that no significant inconsistency was existed (P > 0.05). Conclusions Based on the results of NMA, DCSD may be a most effective and safest choice for phimosis and redundant prepuce. DCSD has the advantages of a shorter operation time, better postoperative penile appearance, fewer complication and shorter wound healing time.

Evidence-based recommendations for treating persons having presumed latent tuberculosis (LTBI) after contact to infectious multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are lacking because published data consist of small observational studies. Tuberculosis incidence in persons treated for latent MDR -TB infection is unknown. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of studies published 1 January 1994-31 December 2014 to analyze TB incidence, treatment completion and discontinuation, and cost-effectiveness. We considered contacts with LTBI effectively treated if they were on ?1 medication to which their MDR-TB strain was likely susceptible. We selected studies that compared treatment vs nontreatment outcomes and performed a meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk of TB incidence and its 95% confidence interval. Results. We abstracted data from 21 articles that met inclusion criteria. Six articles presented outcomes for contacts who were treated compared with those not treated for MDR-LTBI; 10 presented outcomes only for treated contacts, and 5 presented outcomes only for untreated contacts. The estimated MDR-TB incidence reduction was 90% (9%-99%) using data from 5 comparison studies. We also found high treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse effects in persons taking pyrazinamide-containing regimens. Cost-effectiveness was greatest using a fluoroquinolone/ethambutol combination regimen. Conclusions. Few studies met inclusion criteria, therefore results should be cautiously interpreted. We found a reduced risk of TB incidence with treatment for MDR-LTBI, suggesting effectiveness in prevention of progression to MDR-TB, and confirmed cost-effectiveness. However, we found that pyrazinamide-containing MDR-LTBI regimens often resulted in treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. ?

METHODS A comprehensive systematic literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was carried out to identify studies comparing RAG and OG in gastric cancer. Participants of any age and sex were considered for inclusion in comparative studies of the two techniques independently from type of gastrectomy. A meta-analysis of short-term perioperative outcomes was performed to evaluate whether RAG is equivalent to OG. The primary outcome measures were set for estimated blood loss, operative time, conversion rate, morbidity, and hospital stay. Secondary among postoperative complications, wound infection, bleeding and anastomotic leakage were also analysed. RESULTS A total of 6 articles, 5 retrospective and 1 randomized controlled study, involving 6123 patients overall, with 689 (11.3%) cases submitted to RAG and 5434 (88.7%) to OG, satisfied the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. RAG was associated with longer operation time than OG (weighted mean difference 72.20 min; P < 0.001), but with reduction in blood loss and shorter hospital stay (weighted mean difference -166.83 mL and -1.97 d respectively; P < 0.001). No differences were found with respect to overall postoperative complications (P = 0.65), wound infection (P = 0.35), bleeding (P = 0.65), and anastomotic leakage (P = 0.06). The postoperative mortality rates were similar between the two groups. With respect to oncological outcomes, no statistical differences among the number of harvested lymph nodes were found (weighted mean difference -1.12; P = 0.10).

Eight randomized controlled trials were available for analysis. A meta-analysis (with a fixed-effects model) and a meta-regression analysis (with continuous variables) were performed. Results: The 8 trials included 1,204 hips (608 cemented and 596 cementless). There was no significant difference between the cemented and cementless groups regarding the incidence of deep infection, superficial infection, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The overall incidence of postoperative deep infection was 2.3% (14/608) in the cemented group and 1.2% (7/596) in the cementless group (relative risk, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 4.14; I2 = 0%; p = 0.206). No publication bias was found in the funnel plot. Conclusions: Results of our meta-analysis suggest that when selecting a fixation method for hemiarthroplasty, infection-related postoperative complications are not the determinant factor to consider. ? 2017 by The Korean Orthopaedic Association."

However, the role of HPV16 infections in oral leukoplakia is not well studied. To determine the role of this virus in the progressive development of oral leukoplakia, we estimated the risk of HPV16 detection in normal oral mucosa and in oral leukoplakia by meta-analysis. Methods Relevant studies on both HPV16 infections and oral leukoplakia were identified. A random-effect model was used to calculate summary prevalence, odds ratios (ORs), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results In this analysis, 398 oral leukoplakia cases and 322 controls from 9 studies were evaluated to estimate the association between infection of HPV16 and the risk of oral leukoplakia. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 9 studies showed a significant increase in oral leukoplakia risk with HPV16 infections (summary ORs: 3.59; 95% CIs: 2.77¡V5.57). Conclusions This meta-analysis suggests that HPV16 is a significant independent risk factor for oral leukoplakia, which might be valuable information for early prevention and treatment of these potential precancerous oral lesions. ? 2017"

The study had two aims: a) to investigate risk factors of influenza virus infection during pregnancy, and b) to analyze the impact of influenza virus infection on pregnancy outcome, especially birth weight. Methods: Prospective and retrospective observational studies found in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and WangFang database were included in this meta analysis. Data of included studies was extracted and analyzed by the RevMan software. Results: Pregnant women with anemia (P=0.004, RR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.13-1.88), obesity (P<0.00001, RR=1.35, 95% CI: 1.25-1.46) and asthma (P<0.00001, RR=1.99, 95% CI: 1.67-2.37) had higher rates of influenza virus infection.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical literature,2017,Clinical Microbiology and Infection,10.1016/j.cmi.2016.12.005,27956267,"Objectives We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the clinical evidence and usage patterns of intravenous fosfomycin from its development to the present time. Methods PubMed, the Cochrane Library and local journals were searched for relevant studies reporting aggregated data of intravenous fosfomycin use in adults and children, with no restrictions regarding study design. Single case reports were excluded. Data were systematically abstracted for all included studies. Clinical and microbiological efficacy from randomized controlled and comparative observational studies were synthesized using meta-analysis to calculate pooled effect sizes. Results In all, 128 studies on intravenous fosfomycin in 5527 patients were evaluated. Fosfomycin was predominantly used for sepsis/bacteraemia, urinary tract, respiratory tract, bone and joint, and central nervous system infections. No difference in clinical (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.96¡V2.15) or microbiological (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.82¡V2.01) efficacy between fosfomycin and other antibiotics was observed in comparative trials. The pooled estimate for resistance development during fosfomycin monotherapy was 3.4% (95% CI 1.8%¡V5.1%). Fosfomycin showed a favourable safety profile, with generally mild adverse events not requiring discontinuation of treatment. Included studies explored intravenous fosfomycin as an anti-staphylococcal agent in monotherapy and combination therapy, whereas studies from 1990 focused on combination therapy (fosfoymcin + £]-lactams or aminoglycosides) for challenging infections frequently caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Conclusion Intravenous fosfomycin can play a vital role in the antibiotic armamentarium, given its long history of effective and safe use.

We selected the comparative studies reported the surgical safety (overall; peri-operative; and post-operative complications; death within 30 days; and specific morbidities), and clinical effectiveness (survival; recurrence; length of stay [LOS]; estimated blood loss [EBL]; operative time [OT]) and patient-reported outcomes. Results Fifteen studies comparing RH with OH and 11 comparing RH with LH were identified. No significant differences were found in survival outcomes. The LOS was shorter and transfusion rate was lower with RH compared to OH or LH. EBL was significantly reduced with RH compared to OH. Compared to OH, overall complications, urinary infection, wound infection, and fever were significantly less frequent with RH. The overall, peri-operative, and post-operative complications were similar in other comparisons. Several patient-reported outcomes were improved with RH, though each outcome was reported in only one study. Conclusions RH appears to have a positive effect in reducing overall complications, individual adverse events including wound infection, fever, urinary tract infection, transfusion, LOS, EBL, and time to diet than OH for cervical cancer patients.

Combination of protease, NS5A, and NS5B inhibitors, with or without pegylated-interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV), results in significantly high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) among post-LT patients with HCV infection. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens in post-LT patients with HCV infection. Evidence Acquisition: We conducted a systematic search in electronic databases to detect eligible studies on DAA treatments after LT. We evaluated English-language studies, including clinical trials and cohort studies, which used antiviral DAA regimens (with or without PEG-IFN/RBV) and reported SVR rates at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). After data extraction, the pooled SVRs were calculated, using STATA version 11. Results: A total of 35 studies with various HCV genotypes were included in our analysis. Due to the small sample size and lack of suitable data on HCV genotypes 2 - 6, the meta-analysis was only conducted among patients with HCV genotype 1; the results of other studies were also obtained. SVR12 rates ranged from 91% to 97% in patients with 12- or 24-week sofosbuvir (SOF)/simeprevir (SMV) ¡Ó RBV, SOF/ledipasvir (LDV) ¡Ó RBV, and SOF/daclatasvir (DCV) ¡Ó RBV regimens. The minimum SVR12 rate was found in patients receiving SMV plus PEG-IFN/RBV (59%; 95% Confidence Interval, 49 - 68). Conclusions: Administration of new HCV DAA regimens can prevent post-LT HCV infection. The combination of SOF/DCV and SOF/LDV, with or without RBV, for 12 or 24 weeks can produce high rates of SVR12 in post-LT HCV patients in different settings. ? 2017, Hepatitis Monthly."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess its efficacy and safety in the prophylaxis of UTI. Methods We performed a systematic review of all controlled trials in humans assessing nitrofurantoin for UTI prophylaxis published from 1946 to 2015. We further reviewed population-level cohort studies evaluating nitrofurantoin's toxicity. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on controlled trials. Results Twenty-six controlled trials including 3052 patients fulfilled entry criteria for the systematic review and meta-analysis on efficacy and toxicity, and 16 population-level cohort studies were identified for review of toxicity. Overall quality was poor, with all studies at increased risk for various biases. When compared with no prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI (risk ratio 0.38 in favour of nitrofurantoin, 95% CI 0.30¡V0.48). Its prophylactic efficacy is superior to that of methenamine hippurate and comparable to that of other antibacterials. Compared with patients receiving other antibacterials, those receiving nitrofurantoin had an increased risk of 2.24 (95% CI 1.77¡V2.83) for a non-severe adverse effect. In all controlled trials, only one patient experienced a severe adverse effect (interstitial pneumonia). Cohort studies reported severe adverse effect frequencies of 0.02¡V1.5 per 1000 nitrofurantoin users. Conclusions Nitrofurantoin is effective in the prevention of UTI. Its use may be associated with increased non-severe adverse effects; severe adverse effects occur infrequently. The risk of severe toxicity seems to increase with the duration of nitrofurantoin prophylaxis. ? 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between gastric acid suppressants and recurrent CDI. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register, the Cochrane Database, and Web of Science were searched from January 1,1995, to September 30, 2015, for studies assessing the association between gastric acid suppressant exposure and recurrent CDI. Search terms included Clostridium difficile, pseudomembranous colitis, proton pump inhibitor, and histamine H2 blocker. STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and clinical trials that included patients with CDI who did or did not receive gastric acid suppressant therapy and who were evaluated for recurrent CDI were included, with no restriction on study setting (inpatient or outpatient). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of included studies. In this scale, case-control and cohort studies were scored on selection, comparability, and ascertainment of the outcome of interest. Data were independently abstracted to a predetermined collection form by 2 investigators. Summary odds ratio estimates with 95% CIs were calculated using the random-effects model and software to calculate the pooled effect size of studies reporting multivariate analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Risk of recurrent infection in patients with CDI and its association with use of gastric acid suppressant medication. RESULTS: Sixteen observational studies were included, together reporting 7703 patients with CDI; among these, 1525 patients (19.8%) developed recurrent CDI. The rate of recurrent CDI in patients with gastric acid suppression was 22.1% (892 of 4038 patients) compared with 17.3% (633 of 3665) in patients without gastric acid suppression, which indicated an increased risk by meta-analysis (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.20-1.94; P &lt; .001). There was significant heterogeneity among the studies, with an I2 value of 64%. Subgroup analyses of studies adjusting for age and potential confounders confirmed an increased risk of recurrent CDI with use of gastric acid suppressants (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08-1.76; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Meta-analyses of observational studies suggest that patients who receive gastric acid suppressants may be at increased risk for recurrent CDI. These data should be interpreted with caution because they may be confounded owing to the observational design of the individual studies. It may be reasonable to re-evaluate the need for these medications in patients with CDI. ? 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

Methods: In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the safety of TNF-£\ inhibitors compared with placebo in reducing pain, swelling, and inflammation of AS patients. Eight relevant articles including 2049 patients were included for this metaanalysis study. We observed that the incidence of adverse events (RR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.33; P=.501, I2=0%) and injection-site reaction (RR=2.93, 95% CI: 2.02-4.23; P=.691, I2=0%) in AS patients' treatment with TNF-£\ inhibitors was significantly higher than that with placebo. Results: However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of serious adverse event, infection, serious infection, and discontinuations due to adverse event. TNF-£\ inhibitors may be a promising treatment for AS, but carries an increased incidence rate of adverse events and injection-site reaction.

Indications for transfusion in patients after hip or knee surgery have not been definitively evaluated and remain controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the benefits and harms of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in patients after hip or knee surgery. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies through September 2015. The main clinical outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included 30-day mortality, infection rate, cardiogenic complications, and length of hospital stay. The meta-analysis program of the Cochrane Collaboration (RevMan version 5.3.0) was used for data analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by both Cochran chi-squared test (Q test) and I2 test. Begg and Egger test were used to assess potential publication bias. Results: We identified 10 eligible RCTs, involving 3788 patients in total. In patients undergoing hip or knee surgery, we found no differences in mortality, or the incidence rates of pneumonia, wound infection, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure, between restrictive and liberal thresholds for RBC transfusion (P>.05). Conclusion: Restrictive transfusion has no advantage over the liberal strategy. However, considerably less patients received blood transfusion via the restrictive strategy than with the liberal counterpart. Due to variations in the included studies, additional larger scale and well-designed studies are required to validate these conclusions. ? 2017 the Author(s).

The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of autologous HSCT therapy for refractory CD. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, and Web of Science from inception to February 2017. The pooled estimate rates for efficacy and safety of refractory CD was performed by meta-analysis and reported according to the standard Cochrane guidelines and the PRISMA statement. Results: Four prospective uncontrolled cohort studies, 4 prospective case series, and 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) were included. Autologous HSCT had a high rate of clinical and endoscopic remission in refractory CD [79.4%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.550-0.924; 81.9%, 95% CI: 0.603-0.931, respectively]. In the case of safety, it had a relatively high incidence rate of transplant-related mortality (6.4%, 95% CI: 0.028-0.140). A significant association was observed between autologous HSCT and the incidence of febrile neutropenia (83.2%, 95% CI: 0.632-0.934). About 18.5% (95% CI: 0.061-0.442) of patients with refractory CD reached clinical remission at mobilization phase. Besides, 82.1% (95% CI: 0.692-0.903) and 54.1% (95% CI: 0.261-0.797) patients with refractory CD could achieve immunosuppressive-free and steroid-free remission for at least 12 months after the therapy. Conclusion: Autologous HSCT could be a complicated treatment with relatively high mortality and significantly high efficacy for refractory CD, which should be used with caution. However, more RCTs of larger samples using refined and standardized protocols and longer period of follow-up time are needed to further assess the outcomes of autologous HSCT therapy.

In numerous Asian countries, sporadic studies have been conducted to investigate the prevalence of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae. In the present study, we determine the precise prevalence of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae in different parts of Asia indeed. Methods Several international databases including Medline, Embase, and Web of sciences were searched from March 2005 to Jan 2016 to discern studies addressed the prevalence of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae in Asia. Comprehensive meta-analysis (V2.2, Biostat) software was used to interpret the data. Results Of the 595 records identified from the databases, 19 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria ostensibly. The analyses manifested that the prevalence of blaNDM?-producing K. pneumoniae was 32.5% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 22.6¡V44.3] in the analyzed Asian countries. Hence, the further stratified analyses indicated that the prevalence of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae was higher in the probes, particularly after 2010. Conclusions The relatively high prevalence of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae merits our analysis. Moreover, regular surveillance for hospital-associated infection, monitoring antibiotic sensitivity pattern, and formulation of definite antibiotic policies advocates viable roles for prevention and control of blaNDM?1-producing K. pneumoniae. ? 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS"

Conclusions: For pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels, tenofovir administration in the second or third trimester can prevent mother to child transmission when combined with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the hepatitis B vaccine. Tenofovir is safe and tolerable for both the mother and foetus. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Objectives: To study whether subcutaneous tissue closure following caesarean section results in decreased wound complications. Search strategy: We systematically searched Medline (1966¡V2016), Scopus (2004¡V2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (2008¡V2016) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials CENTRAL (1999¡V2016) databases together with reference lists from included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials that investigated the impact of subcutaneous tissue suturing on wound complications following caesarean section were held eligible for inclusion. Retrospective studies and prospective nonrandomised studies were excluded from the present meta-analysis. Data collection and analysis: The methodological quality of studies was assessed with the Jadad scale. Statistical meta-analysis was performed with the RevMan 5.3 software. Main results: Ten studies were finally included in our meta-analysis, which involved 3696 women delivered by caesarean section. Re-approximation of the subcutaneous tissue significantly reduced the odds of developing any type of wound complication [3811 women, random effects model (REM), odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.47¡V0.93]. The incidence of seroma was also decreased (1979 women, REM, OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33¡V0.84). On the other hand, the incidence of haematoma remained unaffected by subcutaneous closure (1663 women, REM, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.22¡V2.42) as well as the likelihood of developing a wound infection (1971 women, REM, OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70¡V1.41). Conclusions: The results of our meta-analysis suggest that subcutaneous tissue closure may benefit women undergoing caesarean section. Current data in women with high body mass index remain very limited; hence, definitive conclusions are precluded for this specific group.

The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to describe epidemiological features of swine influenza (SI) across the world and identify factors impacting swine influenza virus surveillance. Methods: The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published after 1990 containing data on SI on pig and herd-level seroprevalence, isolation and detection rates, and risk factors were included. Meta-regression analyses using seroprevalence and virological rates were performed. Results: A total of 217 articles were included. Low avian influenza (AI) seroprevalence (means pig = 4.1%; herd = 15%) was found, showing that AIV do not readily establish themselves in swine while SIV seroprevalence was usually high across continents (influenza A means pig = 32.6-87.8%; herd = 29.3-100%). Higher pig density and number of pigs per farm were shown by the meta-regression analyses and/or the risk factor articles to be associated with higher SI seroprevalence. Lower seroprevalence levels were observed for countries with low-to-medium GDP. These results suggest that larger industrial farms could be more at risk of SIV circulation. Sampling swine with influenza-like illness (ILI) was positively associated with higher isolation rates; most studies in Europe, Latin and North America were targeting swine with ILI. Conclusions: To improve understanding of SI epidemiology, standardization of the design and reporting of SI epidemiological studies is desirable. Performance of SI surveillance systems in low-tomedium GDP countries should be evaluated to rule out technical issues linked to lower observed SIV prevalence. Targeting certain swine age groups, farming systems and swine with ILI may improve the surveillance cost-effectiveness. However, focusing on pigs with ILI may bias virus detection against strains less virulent for swine but which may be important as pandemic threats. ? 2017 Baudon et al.

Mesh repair is the standard for most repairs; however, the mesh material itself may be a barrier to care, the cost prohibitively high for some populations and healthcare systems. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to produce a pooled comparison between the adverse event rate associated with mosquito net mesh and commercial hernia mesh. Methods: A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Ovid Embase/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and the Cochrane library were searched. In addition, the ISRCTN register, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTR Platform and EU Clinical Trials Register were searched. Results: Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. The RCTs were deemed to have similar sample populations after inspection of their sample parameters. Therefore, the adverse effects were compared individually (reoccurrence, haematoma, seroma, infection, and serous discharge) and pooled. A total of 313 mosquito net?meshes were included in the study, there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups for pooled adverse effects or individually. Conclusions: There is not a significant difference between the commercial mesh group and the mosquito net mesh?group for pooled [odds ratio 0.93 (0.63, 1.35)] and individual adverse event rates. However, the 95% confidence intervals of these results are still wide. To reduce this uncertainty sample sizes must increase in future studies. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag France."

In recent years, guidelines to cardiologists and dentists have advised restriction of AP to high-risk groups (in Europe and the USA) or against its use at all (in the UK). The objective of this systematic review was to appraise the evidence for use of AP for prevention of bacteraemia or IE in patients undergoing dental procedures. Methods We conducted electronic searches in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and ISI Web of Science. We assessed the methodological characteristics of included studies using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology criteria for observational studies and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for trials. Two reviewers independently determined the eligibility of studies, assessed the methodology of included studies and extracted the data. Results We identified 178 eligible studies, of which 36 were included in the review. This included 10 time-Trend studies, 5 observational studies and 21 trials. All trials identified used bacteraemia as an endpoint rather than IE. One time-Trend study suggests that total AP restriction may be associated with a rising incidence of IE, while data on the consequences of relative AP restriction are conflicting. Meta-Analysis of trials indicates that AP is effective in reducing the incidence of bacteraemia (risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.57, p<0.01), but case-control studies suggest this may not translate to a statistically significant protective effect against IE in patients at low risk of disease. Conclusions The evidence base for the use of AP is limited, heterogeneous and the methodological quality of many studies is poor. Postprocedural bacteraemia is not a good surrogate endpoint for IE. Given the logistical challenges of a randomised trial, high-quality case-control studies would help to evaluate the role of dental procedures in causing IE and the efficacy of AP in its prevention. ? ?

Data sources: Electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Pedro, Embase, AMED, and the Cochrane Library were searched in July 2016. Five additional trials were identified through reference list scanning. Study selection: Eligible studies were published in English language peer-reviewed journals; included participants that had undergone total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty reported clearly defined timing of rehabilitation onset for at least two groups; and reported at least one measure of LOS or cost. Inclusion criteria were applied by 2 independent authors, with disagreements being determined by a third author. Searching identified 1,029 potential articles, of which 17 studies with 26,614 participants met the inclusion criteria. Data extraction: Data was extracted independently by 2 authors, with disagreements being determined by a third author. Methodological quality of each study was evaluated independently by 2 authors using the Downs and Black checklist. Pooled analyses were analyzed using a random-effects model with inverse variance methods to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals for LOS. Data synthesis: When compared with standard care, early initiation of physical therapy demonstrated a decrease in length of stay for the 4 randomized clinical trials (SMD = -1.90; 95% CI -2.76 to -1.05; I2 = 93%) and for the quasi-experimental and 5 prospective studies (SMD = -1.47; 95% CI -1.85 to -1.10; I2 = 88%). Conclusion: Early initiation of rehabilitation following total hip arthroplasty, total knee arthroplasty, or unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is associated with a shorter LOS, a lower overall cost, with no evidence of an increased number of adverse reactions. Additional high quality studies with standardized methodology are needed to further examine the impact of early initiation of physical therapy among patients with joint replacement procedures. ? 2017 Masaracchio et al.

As such, therapeutic use of exogenous corticosteroids is a promising adjunctive intervention. Despite a large number of trials examining this research question, uncertainty persists regarding the effect of corticosteroids on survival in sepsis. Several large randomised controlled trials have been published recently prompting a re-evaluation of the available literature. Methods and analysis A rigorous and reproducible search and screening process from a Cochrane review on the same topic was comprehensive to October 2014. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, the Cochrane trial registry and clinicaltrials.gov for eligible randomised controlled trials investigating the use of corticosteroids in patients with sepsis from September 2014. Outcomes have been chosen by a semi-independent guideline panel, created in the context of a parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendation on the topic. This panel includes clinicians, content experts, methodologists and patient representatives, who will help identify patient-important outcomes that are critical for deciding whether to use or not use corticosteroids in sepsis. Two reviewers will independently screen and identify eligible studies; a third reviewer will resolve any disagreements. We will use RevMan to pool effect estimates from included studies for each outcome using a random-effect model. We will present the results as relative risk with 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes and as mean difference or standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95% CI. We will assess the certainty of evidence at the outcome level using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We will conduct a priori subgroup analyses, which have been chosen by the parallel BMJ Rapid Recommendation panel.

Antidepressants have often been the insomnia treatment of choice in recent decades. Some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been shown to improve sleep efficiency. Objective Assess the efficacy and safety of TCAs for the treatment of insomnia using a meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs). Methods Relevant studies were identified in electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science, up until July 2016. We included all polysomnographic (PSG) RCTs using TCAs to treat insomnia. The primary outcome measure was the total sleep time (TST), although other polysomnographic measures were also investigated. Next-day somnolence and dropout rates were also assessed. Results The meta-analysis included nine RCTs. TCAs significantly improved TST compared with placebo (SMD?=?0.61, 95% CI?=?0.50¡V0.71, P?<?0.00001). Participants receiving TCAs were not more likely to drop out than those receiving a placebo because of adverse side effects (1.71% vs 1.19%, RR?=?1.37, 95% CI?=?0.67¡V2.80, P?=?0.39) or any other reason (7.08% vs 8.20%; RR?=?0.86, 95% CI?=?0.60¡V1.23, P?=?0.42).

Conclusions Based on our limited data analysis with two medications at particular doses (most studies included extremely low doxepin), we assert that TCAs can be an effective pharmacological treatment for insomnia. TCAs were found to improve sleep outcome measures, with the notable exception of an 82% increase in somnolence. Overall TCAs have very problematic and dangerous side effects, while TCAs were not found to increase the dropout rate compared with the placebo. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Meta-analysis of cross-reactive antibodies induced by oil-in-water emulsion adjuvanted (OWEA) influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines with circulating heterologous H5N1 virus strains, isolated from human infections was performed. Methods Literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry was conducted up through December 1, 2015. Methodologically qualified studies were included for (1) use of two doses of licensed OWEA (AS03 or MF59) egg-derived, inactivated influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccine, (2) participant age between 18 and 64?years, and (3) evaluation of immunogenicity outcome for one or more subclade. Meta-analysis assessed the cross-reactivity of antibodies elicited by clade 1 adjuvanted vaccine strain against clade 2.1 virus strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vs. A/Indonesia/05/2005); and separately against clade 2.2 virus strain (A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vs. A/turkey/Turkey/1/05); and clade 2.1 adjuvanted vaccine strain against clade 1 virus strain (A/Indonesia/05/2005 vs. A/Vietnam/1194/2004). Quantitative publication bias and influence analysis was conducted to evaluate potential impact of unpublished or new studies on the robustness of meta-analysis. Results Of 960 articles, 53 qualified for quality assessment and 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. All assessed clade pairs elicited cross-reactive antibodies (clade 1 against clade 2.1 and 2.2; clade 2.1 against clade 1, 2.2, and 2.3). Heterologous strains of same sub-clade are likely to elicit higher cross-reactive antibodies. Conclusions OWEA influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines exhibit broad cross-clade immunogenicity, a desired feature for vaccine stockpiling not yet demonstrated by unadjuvanted vaccines. In case of an impending H5N1 virus pandemic, stockpiled OWEA influenza H5N1 virus monovalent vaccines may allow population priming that could slow down the course of pandemic and could offer additional time needed for development of an effective strain specific vaccine supply. ? 2017"

However, no significant association was observed between rs1946518 polymorphism and chronic HBV infection under different comparison models. The present meta-analysis suggested that IL-18 -137 C/G (rs187238) polymorphism in promoter region was associated with chronic HBV infection in Asians, especially in the Chinese populations. ? 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

The objective of this study was to systematically review evidence about the effects of two-dose compared with three-dose schedules for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and to describe the uptake of two-dose HPV vaccination schedules globally. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, trials registers, and manufacturers¡¦ databases from their earliest date to February 2016. We selected randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials that directly compared HPV vaccine schedules with two or three doses. We extracted data on immunological and clinical outcomes and used meta-analysis where appropriate. We also described the use of two-dose HPV vaccine schedules globally. We screened 1464 items and included seven eligible noninferiority trials in 11 countries. In randomised comparisons amongst adolescent girls (three trials), geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of antibodies against HPV16 and HPV18 were non-inferior or inconclusive, up to 24?months after a two-dose compared with a three-dose schedule. One trial with a clinical outcome found no persistent HPV infections occurred after either two or three doses. In non-randomised comparisons, GMC were non-inferior or superior in adolescent girls receiving the two-dose schedule compared with women receiving the three-dose schedule for at least 21?months after vaccination. By February 2017, 23 low and middle income and 25 high income countries had adopted a two-dose HPV vaccination schedule. A two-dose HPV vaccine schedule provides satisfactory immunological outcomes in adolescent girls, but uptake globally is limited, particularly in countries with the highest burden of cervical cancer. ? 2017 The Authors"

Higher-doses of influenza antigen may increase immune response and thus be more effective. Our objectives were to compare the efficacy and safety of the high-dose influenza vaccine to the standard-dose influenza vaccine in the elderly (age?&gt;?65). Methods Data sources: Randomized trials (RCTs) from Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), ClinicalTrials.gov, reference lists of relevant articles, and gray literature. Study selection: Two reviewers independently identified RCTs comparing high-dose influenza vaccine (60?£gg of hemagglutinin per strain) to standard-dose influenza vaccine (15?£gg of hemagglutinin per strain) in adults over the age of 65?years. Data extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted trial-level data including population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and funding sources. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results We included seven eligible trials; all were categorized as having a low (n?=?3) or unclear (n?=?4) risk of bias. Patients receiving the high-dose vaccine had significantly less risk of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections (Relative Risk 0.76, 95%CI 0.65 to 0.90; I2 0%, 2 trials, 41,141 patients). Post-vaccination geometric mean titres and seroprotection rates were also higher in high-dose vaccine recipients. There were no protocol-defined serious adverse events in the included trials in either group. Conclusions In elderly adults, the high-dose influenza vaccine was well-tolerated, more immunogenic, and more efficacious in preventing influenza infections than the standard-dose vaccine. Further pragmatic trials are needed to determine if the higher efficacy translates into higher vaccine effectiveness in adults over the age of 65. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: A systematic search of randomized and non-randomized studies was carried out on Pubmed and Scopus databases until July 2016. Results: The meta-analysis of 30 studies (19 randomized, 11 non-randomized; 15,385 procedures) gave evidence that TCS were associated with a lower risk of SSIs (risk ratio [RR] = 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57-0.81). Triclosan-coated sutures were associated with lower risk for SSIs in high-quality randomized studies (Jadad score 4 or 5). A lower risk for the development of SSIs based on wound classification was observed in clean, clean-contaminated, and contaminated but not for dirty procedures. No benefit was observed in specific types of surgery: colorectal, cardiac, lower limb vascular or breast surgery. Only a trend was found for lower risk for wound dehiscence, whereas no difference was observed for all-cause mortality.

Numerous studies have been performed on intestinal parasitic infections in Iranian preschool and school children. However, no study has gathered and analyzed this information systematically. The aim of this study was to provide summary estimates for the available data on intestinal parasitic infections in Iranian children. We searched 9 English and Persian databases, unpublished data, abstracts of scientific congresses during 1996¡V2015 using the terms intestinal parasite, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Enterobiusvermicularis, oxyure, school, children, preschool, and Iran. We conducted meta-analysis using STATA, and for all statistical tests, p-value less than 0.05was considered significant. Among the 68,532 publications searched as a result, 103 were eligible for inclusion in the study. The prevalence rate of intestinal parasitic infections was 38% (95% CI- 33%, 43%). Prevalence of protozoa, helminthic intestinal infections, and non-pathogenic parasites was 16.9%, 9.48%, and 18.5%, respectively, which affected 14.27% males and 15.3% females. The rate of infection in preschool and school children was 38.19% and 43.37% respectively. Giardia, Enterobiusvermicularis and Entamoeba coli were the most common among protozoa, helminthic, and non-pathogenic infections (15.1%, 16.5%, and 7.1%, respectively). The data analyses indicated that the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection is decreasing in Iranian preschool and school children. Improvement of sanitation, personal hygiene, increased awareness of people, seasonal variations, and health education can be effective in reducing parasitic infections in different communities. ? 2017"

The PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched (last accessed on 29 May 2016) to identify studies evaluating VRE colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalised children in non-outbreak periods. Of 945 non-duplicate citations, 19 studies enrolling 20?234 children were included. The overall and paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) rate of VRE colonisation were both 5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3¡V8% overall and 95% CI 2¡V9% in the PICU] but was 23% in haematology/oncology units (95% CI 18¡V29%). Studies that were exclusively performed in haematology/oncology units reported significantly higher rates compared with all other studies in the univariate and multivariate analyses (P?=?0.001). Previous vancomycin [risk ratio (RR)?=?4.34, 95% CI 2.77¡V6.82] or ceftazidime (RR?=?4.15, 95% CI 2.69¡V6.40) use was a risk factor for VRE colonisation. Importantly, VRE colonisation increased the risk of subsequent VRE infection (RR?=?8.75, 95% CI 3.19¡V23.97). In conclusion, a high rate of VRE colonisation was found among hospitalised children in institutions that performed targeted screening. Importantly, colonised children were almost 9 times more likely to develop subsequent VRE infection. Judicious use of specific antibiotics along with intensification of infection control measures should be considered in high-prevalence institutions. Also, the high incidence of VRE colonisation among children with haematological/oncological diseases identifies a high-risk population. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy"

Methods Medline, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang database and Cochrane central database were searched for relevant original studies from database inception to October 2016. Eligible studies had to meet quality assessment criteria according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and had to evaluate the risk factors for surgical site infection after open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fracture. Stata 11.0 software was used for this meta-analysis. Results Eight studies involving 2214 cases of tibial plateau fracture treated by open reduction and internal fixation and 219 cases of surgical site infection were included in this meta-analysis. The following parameters were identified as significant risk factors for surgical site infection after open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fracture (p?<?0.05): open fracture (OR 3.78; 95% CI 2.71¡V5.27), compartment syndrome (OR 3.53; 95% CI 2.13¡V5.86), operative time (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.53¡V3.02), tobacco use (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.13¡V3.99), and external fixation (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.05¡V4.09). Other factors, including male sex, were not identified as risk factors for surgical site infection. Conclusion Patients with the abovementioned medical conditions are at risk of surgical site infection after open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fracture.

Accordingly, we aim to assess patient-important benefits and harms of untargeted antifungal therapy versus placebo or no treatment in adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection. Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomised clinical trials assessing any untargeted antifungal therapy compared with placebo or no treatment in adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections. The primary outcome is all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes include adverse events, duration of mechanical ventilation and inotropic support, need for renal replacement therapy, emergence of antibiotic resistance and intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay. Conventional meta-analysis, including sensitivity and subgroup analyses, and assessment of the risk of systematic (bias) and random errors will be conducted.

To reduce SSIs, prophylactic intra-operative wound irrigation (pIOWI) has been advocated, although the results to date are equivocal. To develop recommendations for the new World Health Organization (WHO) SSI prevention guidelines, a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis were conducted on the effectiveness of pIOWI using different agents as a means of reducing SSI. Methods: The PUBMED, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and WHO databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing either pIOWI with no pIOWI or with pIOWI using different solutions and techniques were retrieved with SSI as the primary outcome. Meta-analyses were performed, and odds ratios (OR) and the mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled with a random effects model. Results: Twenty-one studies were suitable for analysis, and a distinction was made between intra-peritoneal, mediastinal, and incisional wound irrigation. A low quality of evidence demonstrated a statistically significant benefit for incisional wound irrigation with an aqueous povidone-iodine (PVP-I) solution in clean and clean contaminated wounds (OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.13-0.73; p = 0.007); 50 fewer SSIs per 1,000 procedures (from 19 fewer to 64 fewer)). Antibiotic irrigation had no significant effect in reducing SSIs (OR 1.16; 95% CI 0.64-2.12; p = 0.63). Conclusion: Low-quality evidence suggests considering the use of prophylactic incisional wound irrigation to prevent SSI with an aqueous povidone-iodine solution.

This study was an evaluation of the incidence of EBV infection in malignant salivary gland tumors with the emphasis on tumor type and geographical area. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane library) were searched for data on the prevalence of EBV in malignant salivary gland tumors. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 2.0 (CMA 2.0) using the event rate (ER) for estimation of the incidence of EBV in the salivary gland tumor patients. Publication bias was lacking as assessed through funnel plot analysis with the Begg's and Egger's tests (P > 0.05). Results: Out of 618 studies searched in databases, 19 reported the prevalence of EBV in malignant salivary gland tumors and were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled ER of all studies was 44% [95%CI=21.5-69.2%] with extreme heterogeneity that for the studies in America was 44.2% [95%CI=4.1-93.6%], in Asia (249 patients) was 70% [95%CI= 33.4-91.6%] and in Europe was 11.8% [95%CI=7.4-85.5%] with extreme heterogeneity for three subgroups. The pooled ER for patients with undifferentiated carcinoma was 86.7% [95%CI=71.5-94.4%] compared with 6.6% [95%CI=2.5-16.5%] for other carcinomas. Conclusions: The incidence of EBV infection in malignant salivary gland tumors in Asia was greater than in Europe and America and the higher presence of EBV infection in LEC cases implies that EBV may be a major factor in its etiology or pathogenesis. Genetic, environmental and other geographic factors may also be involved."

Design: Systematic review andmeta-analysis of randomised trials. Method: We searched Medline, Embase, The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature(CINAHL), and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2016. Eligible studies compared long-term antibiotic therapy with non-antibiotic therapy or placebo in men or women aged over 65, or in postmenopausal women, with recurrent UTIs. Results: We did not identify any studies that included older men. Three randomised controlled trials compared long-term antibiotics with vaginal oestrogens (n=150), oral lactobacilli (n=238) and D-mannose powder (n=94) in postmenopausal women. Long-term antibiotics reduced the risk of UTI recurrence by 24% (three trials, n=482; pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.76; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95, number needed to treat=8.5). There was no statistically significant increase in risk of adverse events (mild adverse events: pooled RR 1.52; 95% CI 0.76 to 3.03; serious adverse events: pooled RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.66). One trial showed 90% of urinary and faecal Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole after 1 month of prophylaxis. Conclusions: Findings from three small trials with relatively short follow-up periods suggest long-term antibiotic therapy reduces the risk of recurrence in postmenopausal women with recurrent UTI. We did not identify any evidence to inform several clinically important scenarios including, benefits and harms in older men or frail care home residents, optimal duration of prophylaxis, recurrence rates once prophylaxis stops and effects on urinary antibiotic resistance. ? 2017 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

A Meta-analysis,2017,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,10.1007/s11999-016-5218-0,28050818,"Background: In the assessment of possible periprosthetic knee infection, various imaging modalities are used without consensus regarding the most accurate technique. Questions/Purposes: To perform a meta-analysis to compare the accuracy of various applied imaging modalities in the assessment of periprosthetic knee infection. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with a comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase? in accordance with the PRISMA and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) recommendations to identify clinical studies in which periprosthetic knee infection was investigated with different imaging modalities. The sensitivity and specificity of each imaging technique were determined and compared with the results of microbiologic and histologic analyses, intraoperative findings, and clinical followup of more than 6?months. A total of 23 studies, published between 1990 and 2015, were included for meta-analysis, representing 1027 diagnostic images of symptomatic knee prostheses. Quality of the included studies showed low concerns regarding external validity, whereas internal validity indicated more concerns regarding the risk of bias. The most important concerns were found in the lack of uniform criteria for the diagnosis of a periprosthetic infection and the flow and timing of the included studies. Differences among techniques were tested at a probability less than 0.05 level. Where there was slight overlap of confidence intervals for two means, it is possible for the point estimates to be statistically different from one another at a probability less than 0.05. The z-test was used to statistically analyze differences in these situations. Results: Bone scintigraphy was less specific than all other modalities tested (56%; 95% CI, 0.47¡V0.64; p?&lt;?0.001), and leukocyte scintigraphy (77%; 95% CI, 0.69¡V0.85) was less specific than antigranulocyte scintigraphy (95%; 95% CI, 0.88¡V0.98; p?&lt;?0.001) or combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.86¡V0.97; p?&lt;?0.001). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (84%; 95% CI, 0.76¡V0.90) was more specific than bone scintigraphy (56%; 95% CI, 0.47¡V0.64; p?&lt;?0.001), and less specific than antigranulocyte scintigraphy (95%; 95% CI, 0.88¡V0.98; p?=?0.02) and combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.86¡V0.97; p?&lt;?0.001). Leukocyte scintigraphy (88%; 95% CI, 0.81¡V0.93; p?=?0.01) and antigranulocyte scintigraphy (90%; 95% CI, 0.78¡V0.96; p?=?0.02) were more sensitive than FGD-PET (70%; 95% CI, 0.56¡V0.81). However, because of broad overlapping of confidence intervals, no differences in sensitivity were observed among the other modalities, including combined bone scintigraphy (93%; 95% CI, 0.85¡V0.98) or combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy (80%; 95% CI, 0.66¡V0.91; p?&gt;?0.05 for all paired comparisons). Conclusions: Based on current evidence, antigranulocyte scintigraphy and combined leukocyte and bone marrow scintigraphy appear to be highly specific imaging modalities in confirming periprosthetic knee infection. Bone scintigraphy was a highly sensitive imaging technique but lacks the specificity needed to differentiate among various conditions that cause painful knee prostheses. FDG-PET may not be the preferred imaging modality because it is more expensive and not more effective in confirming periprosthetic knee infection. Level of Evidence: Level III, diagnostic study. ? 2016, The Author(s)."

Methods: A systematic review of 1,435 studies was performed in adults receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Two different administration strategies (adjunctive and substitute) were considered clinically relevant. Inclusion was restricted to studies using jet, ultrasonic, and vibrating-mesh nebulizers. Studies involving children, colonized-but-not-infected adults, and cystic fibrosis patients were excluded. Results: Five of the 11 studies included had a small sample size (fewer than 50 patients), and only 6 were randomized. Diversity of case-mix, dosage, and devices are sources of bias. Only a few patients had severe hypoxemia. Aminoglycosides and colistin were the most common antibiotics, being safe regarding nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, but increased respiratory complications in 9% (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.18; I2 = 52%), particularly when administered to hypoxemic patients. For tracheobronchitis, a significant decrease in emergence of resistance was evidenced (risk ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.64; I2 = 0%). Similar findings were observed in pneumonia by susceptible pathogens, without improvement in mortality or ventilation duration. In pneumonia caused by resistant pathogens, higher clinical resolution (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30 to 2.96; I2 = 0%) was evidenced. These findings were not consistently evidenced in the assessment of efficacy against pneumonia caused by susceptible pathogens. Conclusions: Performance of randomized trials evaluating the impact of nebulized antibiotics with more homogeneous populations, standardized drug delivery, predetermined clinical efficacy, and safety outcomes is urgently required. Infections by resistant pathogens might potentially have higher benefit from nebulized antiinfective agents. Nebulization, without concomitant systemic administration of the drug, may reduce nephrotoxicity but may also be associated with higher risk of respiratory complications.

During the prenatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were maternal and paternal age?35 years, mother's and father's race: White and Asian, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, maternal and paternal education college graduate+, threatened abortion, and antepartum hemorrhage. During perinatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were caesarian delivery, gestational age?36 weeks, parity?4, spontaneous labor, induced labor, no labor, breech presentation, preeclampsia, and fetal distress. During the postnatal period, the factors associated with autism risk were low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage, male gender, and brain anomaly. Parity?4 and female were associated with a decreased risk of autism. In addition, exposure to cigarette smoking, urinary infection, mother's and father's race: Black and Hispanic, mother's country of birth outside Europe and North America, umbilical cord around neck, premature membrane rupture, 5-minutes Apgar score<7, and respiratory infection were not associated with increased risk of autism. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis confirmed the relation between some prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors with autism. All these factors were examined individually, thus it was still unclear that whether these factors are causal or play a secondary role in the development of autism. Further studies are needed to verify our findings, and investigate the effects of multiple factors on autism, rather than the single factor. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

Data Sources: Literature searches were implemented in Ovid Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov through February 2016. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were observational or randomized studies of septic patients, evaluation of antipyretic treatment, mortality reported, and English-language version available. Studies were excluded if they enrolled pediatric patients, patients with neurologic injury, or healthy volunteers. Criteria were applied by two independent reviewers. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted data and evaluated methodologic quality. Outcomes included mortality, frequency of shock reversal, acquisition of nosocomial infections, and changes in body temperature, heart rate, and minute ventilation. Randomized and observational studies were analyzed separately. Data Synthesis: Eight randomized studies (1,507 patients) and eight observational studies (17,432 patients) were analyzed. Antipyretic therapy did not reduce 28-day/hospital mortality in the randomized studies (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.13; I2 = 0.0%) or observational studies (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.54-1.51; I2 = 76.1%). Shock reversal (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68-1.90; I2 = 51.6%) and acquisition of nosocomial infections (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.61-2.09; I2 = 61.0%) were also unchanged. Antipyretic therapy decreased body temperature (mean difference, -0.38¢XC; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.13; I2 = 84.0%), but not heart rate or minute ventilation. Conclusions: Antipyretic treatment does not significantly improve 28-day/hospital mortality in adult patients with sepsis. ? 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The heterogeneity of the samples studied is an obstacle to understanding whether HIV is a vascular risk across geographic regions. Objective To test the hypothesis that HIV infection is a vascular risk factor, and that the risk conferred by HIV varies by geographical region. Data sources A systematic search of publications was carried out in seven electronic databases: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform from inception to July 2015. Study selection We included longitudinal studies of HIV+ individuals and their risk of vascular outcomes of 50 HIV+ cases and excluded studies on biomarkers of vascular disease as well as clinical trials. Data extraction and synthesis Data was extracted by one of the authors and independently confirmed by the other two authors. We used incidence rate (IR), incidence risk ratio (IRR) and hazard ratio (HR) with their 95% confidence intervals as measures of risk. Main outcome All-death, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary heart disease (CHD), any stroke, ischemic stroke (IS) or intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Results We screened 11,482 references for eligibility, and selected 117 for analysis. Forty-four cohorts represented 334,417 HIV+ individuals, 49% from the United States. Compared with their European counterparts, HIV+ individuals in the United States had higher IR of death (IRR 1.78, 1.69-1.88), MI (IRR 1.61, 1.29-2.01), CHD (IRR 2.27, 1.92-2.68), any stroke (IRR 1.94, 1.59-2.38), IS (IRR 1.56, 1.23-1.98), and ICH (IRR 4.03, 2.72-6.14). Compared with HIV- controls and independent of geographical region, HIV was a risk for death (HR 4.77, 4.55-5.00), MI (HR 1.60, 1.49-1.72), any CHD (HR 1.20, 1.15-1.25), any stroke (HR 1.82, 1.53-2.16), IS (HR 1.27, 1.15-1.39) and ICH (HR 2.20, 1.61-3.02). Use of antiretroviral therapy was a consistent risk for cardiac outcomes, while immunosuppression and unsuppressed viral load were consistent risks for cerebral outcomes. Conclusions HIV should be considered a vascular risk, with varying magnitudes across geographical and anatomical regions. We think that strategies to reduce the HIV-related vascular burden are urgent, and should incorporate the disparities noted here."

The outcomes were the rates of clinical response and adverse events among patients treated with biosimilars compared to their reference agents. Additionally, occurrence of anti-drug antibodies with the use of biosimilars was compared to the reference agents. Results Nine studies reporting outcomes in 3291 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were identified (5 infliximab, 2 adalimumab, and 2 etanercept). No RCTs in other diseases were found. Biosimilars of infliximab showed similar rates of clinical response compared to the reference agent in RA and AS.

However, the impact of this use on patient reported outcomes, such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL), remains unclear. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, employing guidelines from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We categorized studies based on design, targeted disease condition, and type of cannabis or cannabinoid used. We scored studies based on quality and risk of bias. After eliminating some studies because of poor quality or insufficient data, we conducted meta-analyses of remaining studies based on design. Results Twenty studies met our pre-defined selection criteria. Eleven studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 2322 participants); the remaining studies were of cohort and cross-sectional design. Studies of cannabinoids were mostly RCTs of higher design quality than studies of cannabis, which utilized smaller self-selected samples in observational studies. Although we did not uncover a significant association between cannabis and cannabinoids for medical conditions and HRQoL, some patients who used them to treat pain, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bower disorders have reported small improvements in HRQoL, whereas some HIV patients have reported reduced HRQoL. Conclusion The relationship between HRQoL and the use of cannabis or cannabinoids for medical conditions is inconclusive. Some patient populations report improvements whereas others report reductions in HRQoL. In order to inform users, practitioners, and policymakers more clearly, future studies should adhere to stricter research quality guidelines and more clearly report patient outcomes. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Although this percentage has been reduced to 5¡V15% with the use of non-bismuth quadruple therapies, limited data exist regarding rescue after failure of these treatments. Aim: The aim of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of quinolone-containing therapies after the failure of non-bismuth quadruple regimens. Methods: Studies evaluating the efficacy of second-line quinolone-containing therapies after the failure of non-bismuth sequential or concomitant regimens were selected. Efficacy (by intention to treat) was analyzed using the inverse variance method; safety data were recorded as the occurrence of any adverse event. The risk of bias of each primary study was evaluated using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies¡Xof Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool. The quality of the evidence was summarized using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Sixteen studies were included. The 10-day levofloxacin/amoxicillin/proton pump inhibitor (PPI) triple therapy (LT) achieved eradication rates of 80% (95% CI 71¡V88). Regarding the moxifloxacin/amoxicillin/PPI triple therapy (MT), its efficacy was higher when administered for 14 days instead of 7 days (80 vs 63%). Two studies investigated the levofloxacin/bismuth-containing quadruple therapies (LBQ) obtaining eradication rates over 90%. Safety was similar in all treatments. The sensitivity analyses showed that results for LT were robust, but MT had weak evidence. Conclusions: Quinolone-containing triple therapies reported eradication rates ?80%, but LBQ therapies showed encouraging rates. However, the strength of the evidence was very low. The efficacy of LBQ should be corroborated in more studies, and the usefulness of quinolones needs to be evaluated in areas with moderate to high bacterial resistances. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed. In this meta-analysis, we conducted online searches of PubMed, Cochrane, Embase using the search terms ¡§thoracolumbar fractures¡¨, ¡§lumbar fractures¡¨, ¡¥¡¥percutaneous¡¦¡¦, ¡§minimally invasive¡¨, ¡¥¡¥open¡¨, ¡§traditional¡¨, ¡§posterior¡¨, ¡§conventional¡¨, ¡§pedicle screw¡¨, ¡§sextant¡¨, and ¡§clinical trial¡¨. The analysis was performed on individual patient data from all the studies that met the selection criteria. Clinical outcomes were expressed as risk difference for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes with 95?% confidence interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using the £q2 test and I2 statistics. Results: There were 4 randomized controlled trials and 14 observational articles included in this analysis. Percutaneous approach was associated with better ODI score, less Cobb angle correction, less Cobb angle correction loss, less postoperative VBA correction, and lower infection rate compared with open approach. Percutaneous approach was also associated with shorter operative duration, longer intraoperative fluoroscopy, less postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% in comparison with traditional open approach. No significant difference was found in Cobb angle correction, postoperative VBA, VBA correction loss, Postoperative VBH%, VBH correction loss, and pedicle screw misplacement between percutaneous approach and open approach. There was no significant difference in operative duration, intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative VAS, and postoperative VBH% between percutaneous approach and paraspianl approach. Conclusions: The functional and the radiological outcome of percutaneous approach would be better than open approach in the long term. Although trans-muscular spatium approach belonged to open fixation methods, it was strictly defined as less invasive approach, which provided less injury to the paraspinal muscles and better reposition effect. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

This systematic review and meta-analyses summarize and quantify the evidence of the effect of storage time of transfused platelets on clinical outcomes. Methods: A systematic search in seven databases was performed up to February 2016. All studies reporting storage time of platelet products and clinical outcomes were included. To quantify heterogeneity, I? was calculated, and to assess publication bias, funnel plots were constructed. Results: Twenty-three studies reported safety outcomes and fifteen efficacy outcomes. The relative risk of a transfusion reaction after old platelets compared to fresh platelets was 1¡P53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1¡P04¡V2¡P25) (12 studies). This was 2¡P05 (CI:1¡P47¡V2¡P85) before and 1¡P05 (CI: 0¡P60¡V1¡P84) after implementation of universal leucoreduction. The relative risk of bleeding was 1¡P13 (CI: 0¡P97¡V1¡P32) for old platelets compared to fresh (five studies). The transfusion interval was 0¡P25 days (CI: 0¡P13; 0¡P38) shorter after transfusion of old platelets (four studies). Three studies reported use of platelet products: two for haematological patients and one for trauma patients. Selecting only studies in haematological patients, the difference was 4¡P51 units (CI: 1¡P92; 7¡P11). Conclusion: Old platelets increase the risk of transfusion reactions in the setting of non-leucoreduction, shorten platelet transfusion intervals, thereby increase the numbers of platelet transfusions in haematological patients, and may increase the risk of bleeding. ? 2017 International Society of Blood Transfusion"

This hypothesis has been tested using ¡§ecological¡¨ studies, which examined the risk for individuals born after epidemics, and ¡§serological¡¨ studies, based on serological evidence. A study of the latter type obtained an increased schizophrenia risk for individuals exposed during the first trimester. A second study found a relationship between influenza at any time during gestation and risk for bipolar disorder with psychotic features. The aims of this paper are to assess the validity of the serological studies and to evaluate the combined results of ecological and serological investigations using meta-analysis. The serological studies turned out to be of limited validity, because they utilized a single serum specimen. Since influenza antibodies can remain positive for years after infection, many mothers of cases may have been infected before pregnancy. For an adequate timing of exposure one needs an acute and a convalescent specimen, obtained 10¡V20?days later. Meta-analysis with respect to schizophrenia: we pooled the results of the single serological investigation and 8 ecological studies related to the 1957 pandemic (with negative results) and found that the first investigation carried hardly any weight.

Objectives: In this review, we assessed the clinical significance of severity assessment tools for HCAP. Methods: We identified related articles from the PubMed database. The eligibility criteria were original research articles evaluating severity scoring tools and reporting the outcomes of mortality in patients with HCAP. Results: Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis. The PORT score and CURB-65 were evaluated in 7 and 8 studies, respectively. Using cutoff values of ?IV and V for the PORT score, the diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) were 5.28 (2.49-11.17) and 3.76 (2.88-4.92), respectively, and the areas under the curve (AUCs) were 0.68 (0.64-0.72) and 0.71 (0.67-0.75), respectively. Conversely, the AUCs for ?IV and V were 0.71 (0.67-0.76) and 0.74 (0.70-0.78), respectively, when applied only to nonimmunocompromised patients. In contrast, when using cutoff values of ?2 and ?3 for CURB-65, the DORs were 3.35 (2.26-4.97) and 2.65 (2.05-3.43), respectively, and the AUCs were 0.65 (0.61-0.69) and 0.66 (0.62-0.70), respectively.

Conclusions: The PORT score and CURB-65 do not have substantial power compared with the tools for CAP patients, although the PORT score is more useful than CURB-65 for predicting mortality in HCAP patients. According to our results, however, these tools, especially the PORT score, can be more useful when limited to nonimmunocompromised patients. ? 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Methods: A computer literature search of PubMed, OVID, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted using relevant keywords. Data were extracted from eligible trials and analyzed using RevMan (Version 5.3 for windows) and OpenMeta [Analyst] software. Results: Six clinical trials (n?=?4118 patients) were pooled in the final analysis.

Analysis of secondary outcomes showed that brodalumab was superior to placebo in terms of static physician¡¦s global assessment (RR?=?32.53, 95% CI 13.80¡V76.69) and psoriasis symptoms inventory scores (RR?=?14.70, 95% CI 8.38¡V25.78). Meta-regression analysis found a significant linear association between the brodalumab dose and the effect size on PASI and psoriasis symptoms inventory scores. The rate of overall adverse events was slightly higher in the brodalumab group (RR?=?1.13, 95% CI 1.06¡V1.22); however, none of the individual adverse events were significantly higher in the brodalumab group, compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: Brodalumab showed an acceptable safety profile and a robust efficacy in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Summary of Background Data: There is ongoing debate on the merits of surgical and conservative treatment for acute appendicitis. Methods: A systematic literature search (Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase) and hand search of retrieved reference lists up to January 2016 was conducted to identify randomized and nonrandomized studies. After critical appraisal, data were analyzed using a random-effects model in a Mantel-Haenszel test or inverse variance to calculate risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Four trials and four cohort studies (2551 patients) were included. We found that 26.5% of patients in the conservative group needed appendectomy within 1 year, resulting in treatment effectiveness of 72.6%, significantly lower than the 99.4% in the surgical group, (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.7-0.79; P = 0.00001; I2 = 62%).

A systemic search of potential relevant literature was performed in databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, EMBASE, and the ISI Web of Knowledge, from their inception to 22 May 2015 using medical subject heading (MeSH) terms ¡§Ilizarov,¡¨ ¡§bone lengthening,¡¨ or ¡§intramedullary nail.¡¨ A total of 89 titles and abstracts were preliminarily reviewed, of which 4 studies eventually satisfied the eligibility criteria, consisting of one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two clinical controlled trials and one retrospective cohort study. A total of 354 limbs were included in the study, among which 183 were lengthened over an intramedullary nail, and 171 limbs were lengthened conventionally. The mean difference (MD) was ?50.21 for the external fixation index between the two groups (95% CI, ?51.83 to ?48.59; P &lt; 0.00001) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%); no significant difference in length was gained (MD = ?0.30, 95% CI = ?0.72 to 0.12; P = 0.16) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 80%); and there was high significant difference for the consolidation index (MD = ?19.97; 95% CI, ?21.59 to ?18.35; P &lt; 0.00001) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 100%). The overall rate of complications was relatively low, and differed significantly between the two groups. Through this meta-analysis, we find that LATN is superior to the conventional method in regards to the external fixation index and the consolidation index, which means that LATN is an effective technique that can decrease the time needed in external fixation. ? 2017 CHINESE ORTHOPAEDIC ASSOCIATION AND JOHN WILEY & SONS AUSTRALIA, LTD."

A systematic review and meta-analysis of short and long term outcomes,2017,International Journal of Surgery,10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.03.050,28344158,"Background Transverse colon malignancies have been excluded from all randomized controlled trials comparing laparoscopic against open colectomies, potentially due to the advanced laparoscopic skills required for dissecting around the middle colic vessels and the associated morbidity. Concerns have been expressed that the laparoscopic approach may compromise the oncological clearance in transverse colon cancer. This study aimed to comprehensively compare the laparoscopic (LPA) to the open (OPA) approach by performing a meta-analysis of long and short term outcomes. Methods Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases were interrogated. Selected studies were critically appraised and the short-term morbidity and long term oncological outcomes were meta-analyzed. Sensitivity analysis according to the quality of the study, type of procedure (laparoscopic vs laparoscopically assisted) and level of lymphadenectomy was performed. Statistical heterogeneity and publication bias were also investigated. Results Eleven case control trials (1415 patients) were included in the study. There was no difference between the LPA and the OPA in overall survival [Hazard Ratio (HR)?=?0.83 (0.56, 1.22); P?=?0.34], disease free survival (p?=?0.20), local recurrence (p?=?0.81) or distant metastases (p?=?0.24). LPA was found to have longer operative time [Weighted mean difference (WMD)?=?45.00 (29.48, 60.52); P?<?0.00001] with earlier establishment of oral intake [WMD?=??1.68 (?1.84,??1.53); P?<?0.00001] and shorter hospital stay [WMD?=?-2.94 (?4.27,??1.62); P?=?0.0001]. No difference was found in relation to anastomotic leakage (p?=?0.39), intra-abdominal abscess (p?=?0.25), lymph nodes harvested (p?=?0.17). Conclusions LPA seems to be safe with equivalent oncological outcomes to OPA and better short term outcomes in selected patient populations. High quality Randomized control trials are required to further investigate the role of laparoscopy in transverse colon cancer. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

However, insufficient number of participants, which were mainly limited to one particular region, limited outcomes analyzed and lack of evidence based analysis to support systematic reviews of the literature were the limitations observed. Therefore, by improving these limitations, we aimed to systematically show the impact of SLE on maternal and fetal outcomes following pregnancy. Methods The Cochrane Database of Randomized Controlled Trials, EMBASE and Medline databases were carefully searched for appropriately relevant English language studies comparing maternal and/or fetal outcomes (endpoints) in pregnant women with and without SLE. With the presence of discontinuous data, risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and the final analysis was carried out by RevMan 5.3 software. Results Eleven studies with a total number of 529,778 participants were included. This current analysis showed cesarean operation to be significantly higher in patients with SLE (RR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.63¡V2.10; P?=?0.00001). Pre-eclampsia and hypertension also significantly affected women with SLE, (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.44¡V2.53; P?=?0.00001) and (RR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.54¡V2.56; P?=?0.00001) respectively. In addition, spontaneous abortion, thromboembolic disease, and post-partum infection were also significantly higher in the SLE subgroup (RR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.26¡V1.82; P?=?0.0001), (RR: 11.29, 95% CI: 6.05¡V21.07; P?=?0.00001) and (RR: 4.35, 95% CI: 2.69¡V7.03; P?=?0.00001) respectively. Live birth significantly favored infants who were born from mothers without SLE (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.14¡V1.67; P?=?0.001). Significantly higher premature birth and infants classified as ¡¥small for gestational age¡¦ were associated with SLE, (RR: 3.05, 95% CI: 2.56¡V3.63; P?=?0.00001) and (RR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.53¡V1.88; P?=?0.00001) respectively. In addition, SLE was significantly associated with increased number of infants that required neonatal intensive care unit and infants with congenital defects (RR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.27¡V3.35; P?=?0.00001) and (RR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.93¡V3.58; P?=?0.00001) respectively. Conclusions This meta-analysis has shown SLE to indeed have a high impact on maternal and fetal outcomes following pregnancy. Therefore, special treatments and care should be allocated to those women in order to manage adverse outcomes that might follow, and to improve successful normal delivery, term infants and to reduce congenital abnormalities in infants who were born from mothers with SLE. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: A comprehensive literature search for related trials published up to December 2015 was performed. Eligible studies were Phase III RCTs of advanced/metastatic GC patients assigned to MTAs or control group. Data were extracted by two authors for severe and fatal AEs (FAEs). Results: A total of nine Phase III RCTs involved 4,934 GC patients were ultimately identified. The pooled results demonstrated that the addition of TAs to therapies in advanced GC significantly increased the risk of developing severe AEs (relative risk: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.02¡V1.24, P=0.02), but not for FAEs (relative risk: 0.97, 95% confidence interval: 0.65¡V1.45, P=0.88). Additionally, the most common causes of FAEs with MTAs were infections (16.3%), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (8.2%), and arterial thromboembolic events (8.2%), respectively. Conclusion: With available evidence, the use of TAs in GC patients was associated with an increased risk of severe AEs, but not for FAE. Clinicians should be aware of the risk of severe AEs with the administration of these drugs in these patients. ? 2017 Wang et al."

Social and behavioral interventions have been implemented in different contexts to improve the quality of life among HIV infected people. This review appraises the evidence for available interventions that focused on quality of life of HIV infected people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Methods: We searched electronic databases for randomized controlled trials of interventions to improve the quality of life of HIV infected people receiving ART. We searched PUBMED and the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) with the terms ""social"", ""behavioral"", ""educational"", ""quality of life"", ""HIV"", and ""RCT"". Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to December 16, 2015. Standardized data abstraction methods and searching steps were applied. Results: Twenty-eight studies reported the impact of social or behavioral interventions in quality of life among HIV infected people, of which 15 were conducted in United States of America. A total of 4136 participants were enrolled. Of the 28 studies, four studies included females, two studies included males and remaining studies excluded both males and females. The overall reported methodological quality of the studies was subject to a high risk of bias and the study criteria were unclear in most studies. Twenty-one studies reported a significant intervention effect on at least one quality of life domain. Meta-analyses showed significant improvement in general health, mental health, physical function and environment domains of quality of life among intervention groups. However, the expected impact of the intervention was low to moderate because the rigorousness of the studies was low, information was limited, the sample sizes were small and other the quality of the study designs were poor. Conclusions: Although the available evidence suggests that existing social and behavioral interventions can improve some quality of life domains, the quality of evidence was insufficient to support the notion that these interventions can improve the overall quality of life of HIV infected people receiving ART. Well-designed and rigorous randomized controlled trials with high methodological quality are required. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

This study aimed to identify factors that explain fine-scale variation in malaria risk across settings and improve definitions and methods for malaria micro-epidemiology. Methods: A systematic review of studies that examined risk factors for variation in malaria infection between individuals, households, clusters, hotspots, or villages in any malaria-endemic setting was conducted. Four databases were searched for studies published up until 6th October 2015. Crude and adjusted effect estimates for risk factors for malaria infection were combined in random effects meta-analyses. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results: From 743 retrieved records, 51 studies were selected, representing populations comprising over 160,000 individuals in 21 countries, in high- and low-endemicity settings. Sixty-five risk factors were identified and meta-analyses were conducted for 11 risk factors. Most studies focused on environmental factors, especially increasing distance from a breeding site (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92, 10 studies). Individual bed net use was protective (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.77, 12 studies), but not household bed net ownership. Increasing household size (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, 4 studies) and household crowding (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.48-2.16, 4 studies) were associated with malaria infection. Health seeking behaviour, medical history and genetic traits were less frequently studied. Only six studies examined whether individual-level risk factors explained differences in malaria risk at village or hotspot level, and five studies reported different risk factors at different levels of analysis. The risk of bias varied from low to high in individual studies. Insufficient reporting and comparability of measurements limited the number of meta-analyses conducted. Conclusions: Several variables associated with individual-level malaria infection were identified, but there was limited evidence that these factors explain variation in malaria risk at village or hotspot level. Social, population and other factors may confound estimates of environmental risk factors, yet these variables are not included in many studies. A structured framework of malaria risk factors is proposed to improve study design and quality of evidence in future micro-epidemiological studies. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

We also manually searched the articles from reference lists of the retrieved articles, which used the NPWT system in studies of vacuum-assisted closure therapy. Studies were identified and selected, and two independent reviewers extracted data from the studies. Results: A total of eleven randomized controlled trials, which included a total of 1,044 patients, were selected from 691 identified studies. Compared with standard dressing changes, NPWT had a higher rate of complete healing of ulcers (relative risk, 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24¡V1.76; P<0.001), shorter healing time (mean difference, ¡V8.07; 95% CI: ¡V13.70¡V ¡V2.45; P=0.005), greater reduction in ulcer area (mean difference, 12.18; 95% CI: 8.50¡V15.86; P<0.00001), greater reduction in ulcer depth (mean difference, 40.82; 95% CI: 35.97¡V45.67; P<0.00001), fewer amputations (relative risk, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.15¡V0.62; P=0.001), and no effect on the incidence of treatment-related adverse effects (relative risk, 1.12; 95% CI: 0.66¡V1.89; P=0.68). Meanwhile, many analyses showed that the NPWT was more cost-effective than standard dressing changes.

The purposes of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to evaluate the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in Iranian pregnant women, and girls and women of childbearing age, and identify potentially preventable risk factors. Methods: Between November 2014 and February 2017, nine electronic databases that reported data on the T. gondii seroprevalence in Iranian women were searched. Our search resulted in 83 reports published from 1994 to 2017. Results: The results showed that the pooled estimation for the prevalence of T. gondii using a random-effect model was 43% (95% confidence interval (CI)=38-48%) in pregnant women and 33% (95% CI=23-43%) in girls and the childbearing age groups. There was a significant association between the T. gondii seroprevalence with age and the gestational age of conception in pregnant women and those who had contact with cats in both groups. Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive systematic review of T. gondii infection seroprevalence in Iranian women, which showed a high prevalence of Toxoplasma infection. Around 57% of pregnant women and 67% of girls and the childbearing age groups were seronegative and thus were susceptible to infection and should be monitored. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

Due to tigecycline has shown excellent in vitro activity against most pathogens, tigecycline is selected as one of the candidate drugs for the treatment of multidrug-resistant organisms infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the use of tigecycline for the treatment of patients with BSI. The PubMed and Embase databases were systematically searched, to identify published studies, and we searched clinical trial registries to identify completed unpublished studies, the results of which were obtained through the manufacturer. The primary outcome was mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the rate of clinical cure and microbiological success. 24 controlled studies were included in this systematic review. All-cause mortality was lower with tigecycline than with control antibiotic agents, but the difference was not significant (OR 0.85, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-2.33; P = 0.745]). Clinical cure was significantly higher with tigecycline groups (OR 1.76, [95% CI 1.26-2.45; P = 0.001]). Eradication efficiency did not differ between tigecycline and control regimens, but the sample size for these comparisons was small. Subgroup analyses showed good clinical cure result in bacteremia patients with CAP. Tigecycline monotherapy was associated with a OR of 2.73 (95% CI 1.53-4.87) for mortality compared with tigecycline combination therapy (6 studies; 250 patients), without heterogeneity. Five studies reporting on 398 patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae BSI showed significantly lower mortality in the tigecycline arm than in the control arm. The combined treatment with tigecycline may be considered the optimal option for severely ill patients with BSI. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

Methods To provide updated estimates of the incidence, serotype distribution, and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Streptococcus pneumoniae causing disease in Africa, we performed a systematic review of articles published from 2000 to 2015 using Ovid Medline and Embase. We included prospective and surveillance studies that applied predefined diagnostic criteria. Meta-analysis for all pooled analyses was based on random-effects models. Results We included 38 studies consisting of 386,880 participants in 21 countries over a total of 350,613 person-years. The pooled incidence of IPD was 62.6 (95% CI 16.9, 226.5) per 100,000 person-years, including meningitis which had a pooled incidence of 24.7 (95% CI 11.9, 51.6) per 100,000 person-years. The pooled prevalence of penicillin susceptibility was 78.1% (95% CI 61.9, 89.2). Cumulatively, PCV10 and PCV13 included 66.9% (95% CI 55.9, 76.7) and 80.6% (95% CI 66.3, 90.5) of IPD serotypes, respectively. Conclusions Our study provides an integrated and robust summary of incidence data, serotype distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility for S. pneumoniae in children ?5?years of age in Africa prior to widespread introduction of PCV on the continent. The heterogeneity of studies and wide range of incidence rates across the continent indicate that surveillance efforts should be intensified in all regions of Africa to improve the integrity of epidemiologic data, vaccine impact and cost benefit. Although the incidence of IPD in young children in Africa is substantial, currently available conjugate vaccines are estimated to cover the majority of invasive disease-causing pneumococcal serotypes. These data provide a reliable baseline from which to monitor the impact of the broad introduction of PCV. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

The choice between neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) remains controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate benefits and safety of NHT compared with NCT for operable BC patients. Areas covered: Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing NHT and NCT for treatment of invasive and immunohistochemically ER+ BC. Major outcomes were clinical response rate, pathologic complete response (pCR), operation methods, recurrence, and adverse events. Five RCTs were included. The clinical response rates between NHT and NCT were not statistically different overall, or in ER-rich patients or postmenopausal women. Compared with NCT, NHT had a significant reduction of complete response rate and an increment in progressive disease rate. NHT increased rates of breast conserving surgery (BCS) and wide local excision (WLE) compared with NCT. All the other parameters were comparable. Patients receiving NHT had better tolerance than those undergoing NCT. Expert commentary: When treating BC, NHT was well tolerated, and contributed to more BCS and WLE cases, especially in ER-rich postmenopausal patients. While for those who are eligible for chemotherapy, NCT might be better recommended due to higher response rates. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Although subclavian was considered the most appropriate site, its preferential use in ICU patients is not generalized and questioned by contradicted meta-analysis results. In addition, conflicting data exist on alternative site selection whenever subclavian is contraindicated. Objective: To compare catheter-related bloodstream infection and colonization risk between the three sites (subclavian, internal jugular, and femoral) in adult ICU patients. Data Source: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Study Selection: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials and observational ones. Data Extraction: Extracted data were analyzed by pairwise and network meta-analysis. Data Synthesis: Twenty studies were included; 11 were observational, seven were randomized controlled trials for other outcomes, and two were randomized controlled trials for sites. We evaluated 18,554 central venous catheters: 9,331 from observational studies, 5,482 from randomized controlled trials for other outcomes, and 3,741 from randomized controlled trials for sites. Colonization risk was higher for internal jugular (relative risk, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.84-2.75]; I2 = 0%) and femoral (relative risk, 2.92 [95% CI, 2.11-4.04]; I2 = 24%), compared with subclavian. Catheter-related bloodstream infection risk was comparable for internal jugular and subclavian, higher for femoral than subclavian (relative risk, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.25-4.75]; I2 = 61%), and lower for internal jugular than femoral (relative risk, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.34-0.89]; I2 = 61%). When observational studies that did not control for baseline characteristics were excluded, catheter-related bloodstream infection risk was comparable between the sites. Conclusions: In ICU patients, internal jugular and subclavian may, similarly, decrease catheter-related bloodstream infection risk, when compared with femoral. Subclavian could be suggested as the most appropriate site, whenever colonization risk is considered and not, otherwise, contraindicated. Current evidence on catheter-related bloodstream infection femoral risk, compared with the other sites, is inconclusive.

Methods: We performed a PubMed and Cochrane database literature search to evaluate randomized, placebo-controlled trials of biologics in treating UC and CD. Meta-analysis was performed using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. We determined relative risk (RR) of harm against placebo; number needed to harm (NNH) was reported when appropriate. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Results: Fourteen trials (6 UC and 8 CD) evaluating 5107 patients were included. For anti-tumor necrosis factor agents used in the treatment of UC, golimumab {NNH of 9.3, RR = 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.8)} and pooled studies of infliximab and adalimumab (NNH = 17.2, RR = 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3]) had a statistically significant higher risk for any infection versus placebo. Risk was not significantly increased in anti-tumor necrosis factor trials in CD (RR = 1.1 [95% CI, 0.8-1.5]). By contrast, anti-integrin agents in UC (RR = 1.0 [95% CI, 0.9-1.2]) or CD (RR = 1.1 [95% CI, 0.97-1.3]) did not confer a statistically significant excess risk of infection versus placebo. Conclusions: Anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy but not anti-integrin therapy is associated with a greater infection risk than placebo in treating UC. Neither class of therapy is associated with increased infection risk over placebo in treating CD. Our findings can help guide patient-centered discussions regarding the risk for infection with biological agents. Copyright ? 2017 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc."

Methods All published articles up to December 2015, including descriptive and cross-sectional studies related to the prevalence and genotyping of Microsporidia infection in Iran, was considered in this systematic review. The meta-analysis was done using the random-effects model and Stats Direct statistical software. MEGA 5.05 software and maximum likelihood algorithm with Kimura 2-parameter model were used for phylogenetic analysis. Results Of the 1152 investigated studies, 33 eligible studies reported a prevalence of Microsporidia infection in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. According to this systematic review, the overall prevalence rate of Microsporidia infection in immunocompromised patients in Iran was 8.18%. Furthermore, the overall prevalence rate of Microsporidia infection in immunocompromised patients with chronic diarrhoea, patients with non-diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, and patients with CD4 (<200 cells/£gL) was 15.4%, 4.1%, 0.5%, and 12.9% respectively. The highest prevalence rate of human and animal Microsporidia was estimated in Kerman (29%) and Khuzestan (26.5%). The overall prevalence rate of Microsporidia infection in honeybees using the random-effects model was 40%. Furthermore, the highest prevalence rate of nosemosis was described in East Azerbaijan (48.2%).

The catheter hub should be appropriately disinfected to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). However, compliance with the time-consuming manual disinfection process is low. An alternative is the use of an antiseptic barrier cap, which cleans the catheter hub by continuous passive disinfection. Objective To compare the effects of antiseptic barrier cap use and manual disinfection on the incidence of CLABSIs. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched Embase, Medline Ovid, Web-of-science, CINAHL EBSCO, Cochrane Library, PubMed Publisher and Google Scholar until May 10, 2016. The primary outcome, reduction in CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days, expressed as an incidence rate ratio (IRR), was analyzed with a random effects meta-analysis. Studies were included if 1) conducted in a hospital setting, 2) used antiseptic barrier caps on hubs of central lines with access to the bloodstream and 3) reported the number of CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days when using the barrier cap and when using manual disinfection. Results A total of 1537 articles were identified as potentially relevant and after exclusion of duplicates, 953 articles were screened based on title and abstract; 18 articles were read full text. Eventually, nine studies were included in the systematic review, and seven of these nine in the random effects meta-analysis. The pooled IRR showed that use of the antiseptic barrier cap was effective in reducing CLABSIs (IRR?=?0.59, 95% CI?=?0.45¡V0.77, P?<?0.001).

Aim: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of?CDI on colectomy risk in IBD. Methods: Multiple databases were searched systematically for observational studies reporting colectomy risk in IBD, stratified by the presence of CDI, and the duration of follow-up (short term 3?months, and long term at least 1?year). Weighted summary estimates were calculated using generalised inverse variance with random-effects model. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle¡VOttawa scale. Results: Twelve observational studies were identified and included 35?057 IBD patients with CDI, and 929?259 without CDI. CDI did not increase the short-term colectomy risk in IBD patients overall (10 studies) (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.68¡V2.67), or in patients with ulcerative colitis (nine studies) (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.39¡V3.76). In contrast, CDI was associated with higher long-term colectomy risk in patients with IBD overall (five studies) (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.18¡V4.21), and in patients with ulcerative colitis (four studies) (OR: 2.96; 95% CI: 1.19¡V7.34). The results were stable in subgroups stratified by recruitment period, hospitalisation status and geographical location. All studies were at least of moderate quality. The results were limited in the ability to compare IBD severity and the type of anti-microbial therapy. Conclusion: Based on 12 observational studies with at least moderate quality, Clostridium difficile infection appears to increase colectomy risk in IBD in the long- but not short- term. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

We aimed to review the current literature on the incidence and mortality of severe RSV in children globally. Methods: Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of published data from 2000 onwards, reporting on burden of acute respiratory infection (ARI) due to RSV in children. Main outcomes were hospitalization for severe RSV-ARI and death. Results: Five thousand two hundred and seventy-four references were identified. Fifty-five studies were included from 32 countries. The global RSV-ARI hospitalization estimates, reported per 1,000 children per year (95% Credible Interval (CrI), were 4.37 (2.98, 6.42) among children <5 years, 19.19 (15.04, 24.48) among children <1 year, 20.01 (9.65, 41.31) among children <6 months and 63.85 (37.52, 109.70) among premature children <1 year.

Conclusions: A substantial proportion of RSV-associated morbidity occurs in the first year of life, especially in children born prematurely. These data affirm the importance of RSV disease in the causation of hospitalization and as a significant contributor to pediatric mortality and further demonstrate gestational age as a critical determinant of disease severity. An important limitation of case-fatality ratios is the absence of individual patient characteristics of non-surviving patients.

Methods We performed a systematic review according to the Cochrane Collaboration methodology, including meta-analysis, risk of bias assessment and trial sequential analysis (TSA). We included randomised clinical trials (RCT) assessing empirical mono-antibiotic therapy versus a combination of two or more antibiotics in adult ICU patients with severe sepsis. We exclusively assessed patient-important outcomes, including mortality. Two reviewers independently evaluated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated and the risk of random errors was assessed by TSA. Results Thirteen RCTs (n?=?2633) were included; all were judged as having high risk of bias. Carbapenems were the most frequently used mono-antibiotic (8 of 13 trials).

While benefits of preoperative biliary drainage have been suggested by previous studies, recent evidence has shown no significant improvements of preoperative biliary drainage on the postoperative outcome but rather an increase of complications. There is no clear consensus on whether to treat malignant obstructive jaundice with preoperative biliary drainage prior to operative intervention or to proceed directly to resection. Thus, our aim was to elucidate the impact of preoperative biliary drainage of obstructive jaundice due to malignant pancreatic head tumors on postoperative morbidity and mortality. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and carried out a systematic search of medical databases. The results were analyzed according to predefined criteria. We pooled the incidence of overall complications, wound infection, pancreatic fistula, intra-abdominal abscess, and death within the perioperative time period. Results We initially identified 1,816 studies, and 25 of these (22 retrospective studies, 3 randomized controlled trials) were finally included in the analysis with a total number of 6,214 patients. Analysis revealed an increased incidence of overall complications (odds ratio: 1.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.14¡V1.72; P?=?.002) and wound infections (odds ratio: 1.94; 95% confidence interval: 1.48¡V2.53; P?<?.00001) in patients receiving preoperative biliary drainage compared to operative intervention first. Mortality, incidence of pancreatic fistula, or intra-abdominal abscess formation were not affected by preoperative biliary drainage. Conclusion Preoperative biliary drainage does not have a beneficial effect on postoperative outcome.

Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and reference lists of all eligible articles. Study Selection: Included studies provided data on ICU-acquired colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in previously noncolonized and noninfected patients and used the double disk synergy test for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae phenotypic confirmation. Studies reporting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreaks or data on pediatric population were excluded. Data Extraction: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and performed data extraction. Data Synthesis: Thirteen studies (with 15,045 ICUs-patients) were evaluated using a random-effect model and a meta-regression analysis. The acquisition rate of digestive tract colonization during ICU stay was 7% (95% CI, 5-10) and it varies from 3% (95% CI, 2-4) and 4% (95% CI, 2-6) in the Americas and Europe to 21% (95% CI, 9-35) in the Western Pacific region. Previous hospitalization (risk ratio, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.07-2.31]) or antibiotic use (risk ratio, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.15-2.37]) and exposure to beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (risk ratio, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.24-2.56]) and carbapenems (risk ratio, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.49-3.06]) during the ICU stay were independent risk factors for ICU-acquired colonization. Importantly, colonized patients were more likely to develop an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infection (risk ratio, 49.62 [95% CI, 20.42-120.58]). The sensitivity and specificity of prior colonization to predict subsequent extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae infection were 95.1% (95% CI, 54.7-99.7) and 89.2% (95% CI, 77.2-95.3), respectively. Conclusions: The ICU acquisition rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 5% to 10%. Previous use of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase or carbapenems and recent hospitalization were independent risk factors for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization, and colonization was associated with significantly higher frequency of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae subsequent infection and increased mortality.

Methods: Studies comparing the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for diverticulitis that reported quantitative data were included. Outcome measures were mortality and morbidity rates and length of hospital stay. Results: Four randomized controlled trials - 3 prospective and 21 retrospective - were included in the analysis. The total numbers of patients ranged from 5 to 14,562 in the laparoscopic groups and from 4 to 110,172 in the open surgery groups, and the mean patient age ranged from 38.9 to 78 years. Overall analysis revealed that laparoscopic surgery was associated with lower mortality (pooled OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25-0.63, p < 0.001) and a lower overall morbidity rate (pooled OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.82, p < 0.001) than open surgery. Laparoscopic surgery was associated with a higher anastomotic bleeding rate, but lower rates of ileus, anastomotic leakage, small bowel obstruction, wound infection, fascial dehiscence and intra-abdominal abscesses. Length of hospital stay was less with laparoscopic surgery. Conclusions: The current meta-analysis supports the use of laparoscopy for the treatment of diverticulitis.

Methods: A systematic review of FDA Summary of Safety and Effectiveness reports of the 8 approved cervical TDRs was performed. These were all randomized controlled trials comparing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) to TDR. Important outcome variables were dysphagia, wound infection, neurologic injuries, heterotopic ossification, death, and secondary surgeries. A random effects model was selected a priori. Data on adverse events was abstracted and analyzed by calculating relative risk of ACDF to TDR by meta-analysis techniques. Results: The study included 3027 patients with 1377 randomized to ACDF and 1652 to TDR. No statistical differences were present between the 2 groups in dysphagia/dysphonia, hardware related, heterotopic ossification, death, and overall neurologic adverse events and incidence of neurologic deterioration. The relative risk of wound-related problems ACDF to TDR was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.59, 0.98) favoring ACDF, which was statistically significant, but these were minor and never required a second surgical procedure for deep wound infection.

To investigate the effect of a preventive mesh in PSH formation after an end colostomy, we aimed to meta-analyze all relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched five databases. For each trial, we extracted risk ratios (RRs) of the effects of mesh or no mesh. The primary outcome was incidence of PSH with a minimum follow-up of 12?months with a clinical and/or computed tomography diagnosis. RRs were combined using the random-effect model (Mantel¡VHaenszel). To control the risk of type I error, we performed a trial sequential analysis (TSA). Results: Seven RCTs with low risk of bias (451 patients) were included. Meta-analysis for primary outcome showed a significant reduction of the incidence of PSH using a mesh (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26¡V0.71; P?=?0.0009). Regarding TSA calculation for the primary outcome, the accrued information size (451) was 187.1% of the estimated required information size (RIS) (241).

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library were searched electronically. Outcomes investigated included incidence of aneuploidy, congenital infection, progression of ventriculomegaly, associated brain and extracerebral abnormalities in the apparently isolated cases and neurodevelopmental delay in both apparently and truly isolated cases. Sensitivity analysis was performed according to whether the ventriculomegaly was mild/moderate (atrial width &lt; 15 mm) or severe (atrial width ? 15 mm). Reference lists within relevant articles and reviews were hand-searched for additional reports. Cohort and case¡Vcontrol studies were included.

The full text was retrieved for 202, and 11 studies were included in the systematic review. In fetuses with apparently isolated unilateral ventriculomegaly, no chromosomal abnormalities were identified and the pooled prevalence of congenital infection was 8.2% (95% CI, 3.6¡V14.5%). The pooled prevalence of additional brain abnormalities detected prenatally and postnatally by magnetic resonance imaging was 5.1% (95% CI, 0.2¡V16.1%) and 6.4% (95% CI, 0.3¡V19.4%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of abnormal neurodevelopment was 5.9% (95% CI, 2.2¡V11.2%) in apparently isolated cases with an atrial width of &lt; 15 mm, and it was 7.0% (95% CI, 3.2¡V12.2%) in fetuses with truly isolated unilateral ventriculomegaly. Most cases with apparently isolated ventriculomegaly were classified as mild/moderate (93.5%) and therefore the outcomes in this group were similar to those in the whole cohort of apparently isolated ventriculomegaly. Conclusions: The prevalence of aneuploidy, congenital infection and neurodevelopmental delay in fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis of isolated unilateral ventriculomegaly is likely to be low.

Our meta-analysis showed that LA for CA could reduce the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) (OR?=?0.28; 95% CI: 0.25 to0.31, P?<?0.00001), but LA did not increase the rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess(IAA) (OR?=?0.79; 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.34, P?=?0.40). The results showed that the operating time in the LA groups was much longer than that in the OA groups (WMD?=?13.78, 95% CI: 8.99 to 18.57, P?<?0.00001). However, the length of hospital stays in the LA groups were significantly shorter than those in the OA groups (WMD?=??2.47, 95%CI:??3.75 to??1.19, P?<?0.0002), and the time until oral intake(TTOI) was much earlier in the LA groups than in the OA groups (WMD?=??0.88, 95% CI:??1.20 to??0.55, P?<?0.00001). No significant difference was observed in the times of postoperative analgesia between the two groups(P?>?0.05). Conclusion LA was feasible and safe for complicated appendicitis, and it not only could shorten the hospital stays and the time until oral intake, but it could also reduce the risk of surgical site infection. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

Methods: A systematic literature search with no limits was performed in PubMed and Embase. The last search was performed on April 9, 2016. The outcomes of interests included intraoperative outcomes (operative time, blood loss, length of incision, conversion, lymph nodes harvested, and intraoperative complications) and postoperative outcomes (time to first flatus, time to first defecation, time to liquid diet, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, mortality, ileus, anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bleeding, wound infection, hernia, and intra-abdominal abscess). Results: Fifteen articles and four conference abstracts published between 2004 and 2016 with a total of 1957 patients were enrolled in this meta-analysis. IA was associated with significant less blood loss, smaller length of incision, shorter time to first defecation, shorter time to liquid diet, and shorter length of hospital stay. No differences were found for operative time, conversion, lymph nodes harvested, intraoperative complications, time to first flatus, postoperative complications, mortality, anastomotic leakage, anastomotic bleeding, ileus, wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, or hernia between IA and EA. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that the IA for LRC improves cosmesis and results in better postoperative recovery outcomes without increasing intraoperative and postoperative complications. Furthermore, a large randomized control study is warranted to compare the short-term and long-term outcomes of those two anastomosis techniques. ? 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."

Outcomes and complications between percutaneous and open repair are still controversial. Thus, the purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the outcomes and complications of these two operative methods. Materials and methods We searched multiple databases: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library up to October 2016. Two reviewers independently screened the studies for eligibility, evaluated the quality and extracted data from eligible studies, with confirmation by cross-checking. The major results and conclusions were concluded, and the different complication rates and functional outcomes were compared. Meta-analysis was processed by Rev Man 5.3 software. Results Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and seven retrospective cohort studies involving 815 patients met the inclusion criteria. The sural nerve injury rate in the percutaneous group was significantly higher (RR = 3.52, 95%CI 1.45 to 8.57, P = 0.006). However, deep infection rate in the open group was higher (RR = 0.33, 95%CI 0.11 to 0.96, P = 0.04) and subgroup analysis of five RCTs showed no significant difference (RR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.09 to 2.10, P = 0.29). No significant difference was seen regarding the rate of re-rupture. The time of operation in the percutaneous group was shorter (RR = ?1.99, 95%CI -3.81 to ?0.80, P = 0.001). American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score showed statistically different in the two groups. Other functional outcomes were similar in the two groups. Conclusions Percutaneous repair has the advantages of operation time, deep infection and AOFAS score. The functional outcomes were similar in two treatment groups except AOFAS score. Despite the higher incidence of sural nerve injury, we still believe that percutaneous repair is superior to open repair for treating AATR. ? 2017"

This study conducted a systematic review to synthesize current knowledge about sex differences in smoking behaviors among PLWH. Methods: Over 3000 abstracts from MEDLINE were reviewed and 79 publications met all the review inclusion criteria (ie, reported data on smoking behaviors for PLWH by sex). Sufficient data were available to conduct a meta-analysis for one smoking variable: Current smoking prevalence. Results: Across studies (n = 51), the meta-analytic prevalence of current smoking among female PLWH was 36.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.0% to 45.4%) and male PLWH was 50.3% (95% CI: 44.4% to 56.2%; meta-analytic odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.29 to 2.45). When analyses were repeated just on the US studies (n = 23), the prevalence of current smoking was not significantly different for female PLWH (55.1%, 95% CI: 47.6% to 62.5%) compared with male PLWH (55.5%, 95% CI: 48.2% to 62.5%; meta-analytic odds ratio = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.26). Few studies reported data by sex for other smoking variables (eg, quit attempts, noncigarette tobacco product use) and results for many variables were mixed. Discussion: Unlike the general US population, there was no difference in smoking prevalence for female versus male PLWH (both >50%) indicating that HIV infection status was associated with a greater relative increase in smoking for women than men. More research is needed in all areas of smoking behavior of PLWH to understand similarities and differences by sex to provide the best interventions to reduce the high smoking prevalence for all sexes. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

The seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM), specific to SFTSV in the general population has been investigated in various epidemiological studies with inconsistent results. Here, we clarify this discrepancy and reach a more comprehensive result by mean of a meta-analysis. Methods All relevant articles were searched in the electronic databases (PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database, Chinese Wanfang database) up to November 2016. The pooled seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated by random- or fixed- model on the basis of heterogeneity. Results In total, 21 studies containing 23,848 blood samples from 7 provinces were included in this meta-analysis. The minimum and maximum reported seroprevalences of SFTSV among humans in China were 0.23% and 9.17%, respectively. The overall pooled seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies was 4.3% (95%CI: 3.2%-5.5%). The pooled prevalence was 5.9% (95%CI: 4.7%-7.0%) in Zhejiang province, 4.9% (95%CI: 4.1-5.8%) in Anhui province, 3.9% (95%CI: 1.3%-6.4%) in Shandong province, and 0.7% (95%CI: 0.2%-1.1%) in Jiangsu province. Stratified by occupation, the pooled prevalence of farmer was 6.1% (95%CI: 3.4%-8.9%) and others (mainly are students) was 3.3% (95%CI: 2.4%-4.2%). Additionally, seroprevalence of SFTSV in people who lived in the same village with the patient were higher than that of people who lived in a different village. Seropositive rates in sampling years after 2012 were higher than that before 2012. The prevalence of SFTSV did not differ by age or gender. Sensitive analysis by omitting one study at a time indicated the results of the pooled seroprevalence were robust. Conclusions Seroprevalence of SFTSV among healthy population in central and eastern China is high. Surveillance efforts on mild or asymptomatic infections among endemic persons are needed. ? 2017 Li et al.

There are more than 100 HPV types which cause 60%-70% (high risk types: 16, 18) and 90% (low risk types: 6, 11) cervical cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of L1 protein vaccines against cervical and vaginal cancer. Evidence Acquisition: Different databases (including Scopus, Google scholar, PubMed, Cochrane, and Science Direct) were searched using relevant keywords such as Gardasil, Cervarix, and cervical cancer. After restricting the search strategy and excluding duplicates, the remained articles were screened by investigating their titles, abstracts, and full texts. Cochrane Q-test and I-squared index were used to detect the heterogeneity among the results, and fixed effect model was applied to estimate the pooled risk ratio. Results: By combining the results of 10 primary articles, the efficacy of monovalent (HPV16), bivalent (HPV 16, 18), and quadrivalent (HPV16,11,6,8) vaccines was estimated between 86% and 100%. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis showed that Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines are highly effective against cervical cancer. According to the point that approximately 50% of cervical cancers and human carcinogenicity are related to HPV-16 infection, the bivalent HPV vaccine might have protective effects against HPV-16 CIN2-3 lesion and cervical cancer. ? 2016, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal."

This study identified pre- and peri-operative factors associated with the development of post-operative delirium following hip fracture surgery. Methods: Published and unpublished literature were searched to identify all evidence reporting variables on patient characteristics, on-admission, intra-operative and post-operative management assessing incident delirium in older people following hip fracture surgery. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and mean difference of those who experienced delirium compared to those who did not were calculated for each variable. Evidence was assessed using the Downs and Black appraisal tool and interpreted using the GRADE approach. Results: A total of 6704 people (2090 people with post-operative delirium) from 32 studies were analysed. There was moderate evidence of nearly a two-times greater probability of post-operative delirium for those aged 80 years and over (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.87), whether patients lived in a care institution pre-admission (OR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.79, 3.92), and a six-times greater probability of developing post-operative delirium with a pre-admission diagnosis of dementia (OR: 6.07, 95% CI: 4.84, 7.62). There was no association with intra-operative variables and probability of delirium. Conclusion: Clinicians treating people with a hip fracture should be vigilant towards post-operative delirium if their patients are older, have pre-existing cognitive impairment and poorer overall general health. This is also the case for those who experience post-operative complications such as pneumonia or a urinary tract infection. Copyright ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Therefore, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of these tests compared with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed from inception through January 2016 for observational studies comparing diagnostic tests for CMV reactivation in inflammatory bowel disease. IHC and tissue PCR were considered reference standards and were used to evaluate the accuracy of blood-based tests and hematoxylin and eosin histopathology. Weighted summary estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using bivariate analysis. Results: Nine studies examined the accuracy of blood-based tests for predicting colonic CMV reactivation: 5 studies by pp65 antigenemia and 4 studies by blood PCR. The overall sensitivity was 50.8% (95% CI, 19.9-81.6), the specificity was 99.9% (95% CI, 99-100), and the positive predictive value was 83.8% (95% CI, 58.6-95.0). The sensitivities of pp65 and blood PCR were 39.7% (95% CI, 27.4-52.1) and 60.0% (95% CI, 46.5-73.5), respectively. Nine studies examined the sensitivity of histopathology. The overall sensitivity was 12.5% (95% CI, 3.6-21.4), 34.6% by IHC (95% CI, 13.8-55.4), and 4.7% by tissue PCR (95% CI, 1.2-17.1). Conclusions: Although blood-based tests seem to predict colonic CMV reactivation, they are insensitive tests. Similarly, histopathology has poor sensitivity for detecting colonic CMV. In agreement with current guidelines, these tests should not replace IHC or tissue PCR for detecting CMV reactivation in inflammatory bowel disease.

It is one of the most important tick-borne diseases, which affects livestock productions, reproductions, and accordingly failing economy. In this, systematic review and meta-analysis, study, the prevalence of babesiosis among domestic herbivores in Iran, between 1998 and 2015, was methodically reviewed. Nine databases including five English and four Persian databases were explored. A total of 49 articles, as regards the examination of 13,547 sheep, 1920 goats, 7167 cattle, and 940 horses, corresponding to prevalence of babesiosis from different regions of Iran were gathered for our qualifying criteria. The overall prevalence of babesiosis was expected to be 14% (95% CI 12%, 16%) in domestic herbivores. Our results showed the highest prevalence in Khorasan Razavi (18.6%) and West Azarbaijan (15.2%) and the lowest in Mazandaran (8.8%) and Isfahan provinces (9.6%), respectively. The high prevalence of Babesia infection in herbivores (mostly sheep and goats) confirms the established enzootic situation of babesiosis in Iran, particularly in western and northeastern regions of the country. Our data offered important and updated information on the epidemiology of babesiosis, for the first time, in domestic herbivores in Iran, and will likely be contributing to the expansion of the screening and control strategies to reduce health and economic impacts among farm animals. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

These drugs do not have a steroid structure, but can inhibit surgery-induced miosis, anterior chamber inflammation, and cystoid macular edema (CME). However, the application of NSAIDs remains controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of NSAIDs for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery. Methods: Relevant articles were identified from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to October 2016. The therapeutic effect of NSAIDs on anterior chamber inflammation was evaluated. The important outcomes of overall anterior chamber inflammation, freedom from ocular pain, and treatment-related/serious ocular adverse events were analyzed by using a random-effects network meta-analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed via the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: A total of 19 trials assessing 7,234 patients were included in our meta-analysis. Diclofenac was the most likely to improve anterior chamber inflammation after cataract surgery, followed by nepafenac, ketorolac, bromfenac, and flurbiprofen. Nepafenac was most likely to improve postoperative ocular pain relief, followed by bromfenac and ketorolac. Our analysis of treatment-related/serious ocular adverse events revealed that piroxicam was most likely to have the fewest related adverse events, but the robustness of this finding was low. Diclofenac was another near-ideal drug, followed by nepafenac, bromfenac, and ketorolac. Conclusions: NSAIDs are effective drugs compared to placebos for the relief of anterior chamber inflammation. Furthermore, diclofenac, nepafenac, ketorolac, and bromfenac demonstrated relatively greater significant effects than those of other NSAIDs. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

A meta-analysis of 17 studies including 448 samples was brought into process and 2% (95% CI 0-4%) and 72% (95% CI 56-89%) resistance to colistin and rifampin were observed, respectively. 42% of all isolates showed MIC = 4 ?g/ml (95% CI 14-69%) to rifampin and 30% MIC= 2 ?g/ml to colistin (95% CI 3.8-78%). MIC50 and MIC90 for both rifampin and colistin were 2 ?g/ml and 4 ?g/ml, respectively. 63% of the strains demonstrated synergy (95% CI 37-90%), 7% were highlighted as relative synergism (95% CI 0.0- 13%), 3% showed an additive effect (95% CI -0.0-7%) and 14% were indifferent (95% CI 6-23%). The antagonistic effect was not observed in this combination. Synergy rates of time-kill assay in rifampin and colistin combinations were generally higher than those of check bored microdilution and E-test method. The results demonstrated that the combination therapy could be more useful when compared to monotherapy and that this strategy might reduce the resistance rate to rifampin in MDR A. baumannii isolates. ? 2017 Mohammadi et al."

As a promising procedure, the efficacy and safety of ADM remains controversial. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to compare the efficacy and safety of acellular dermal matrix to standard of care in DFU. Methods Databases, including Pubmed, Medline, Embase and Cochrane library were searched to identify RCTs comparing ADM to SOC in DFU patients. The outcomes mainly included complete wound healing, mean time to heal and adverse events. Results A total of 632 DFU patients from 6 RCTs were subjected to meta-analysis. The results showed that compared with the merely SOC, the complete healing rate in ADM group was higher both at 12 weeks [risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42 to 3.76] and 16 weeks [RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.93]. The mean time to complete wound healing was shorter in ADM group [MD?=??2.98, 95% CI:??5.15 to??0.82]. The occurrence of adverse event in both groups showed no significant difference [RR 0.98, 95%CI 0.58 to 1.67]. Conclusion Compared with standard of care, acellular dermal matrix may accelerate the healing velocity of uninfected, non-ischemic, full-thickness diabetic foot ulcer. Acellular dermal matrix showed superiority compared with standard of care alone, while generating no more complications. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

The effectiveness of £]-lactam/fluoroquinolone (BLFQ) versus £]-lactam/macrolide (BLM) combinations for the treatment of patients with CAP was evaluated. Methods PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched for observational cohort studies, non-randomized and randomized controlled trials providing data for patients with CAP receiving BLM or BLFQ. Mortality was the primary outcome. A meta-analysis was performed. MINORS and GRADE were used for data quality assessment. Results Seventeen studies (16 684 patients) were included. Randomized trials were not identified. A variety of £]-lactams, fluoroquinolones and macrolides were used within and between the studies. Mortality was reported at different time points. The available body of evidence had very low quality. In the analysis of unadjusted data, mortality with BLFQ was higher than with BLM (risk ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.15¡V1.54, I2 28%). BLFQ was associated with higher mortality regardless of the study design, mortality recording time, study period and study BLM group mortality. BLFQ was associated with higher mortality in American but not European studies. No difference was observed in patients with bacteraemia and septic shock. In the meta-analysis of adjusted mortality data, a non-significant difference between the two regimens was observed (eight studies, adjusted risk ratio 1.26, 95% CI 0.95¡V1.67, I2 43%). Conclusion In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials recommendations cannot be made for or against either of the studied regimens in this group of hospitalized patients with CAP. Well designed randomized controlled trials comparing the two regimens are warranted. ? 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

We aimed to determine the pooled rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination and influencing factors. Methods A literature search of the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Ovid, and Scopus databases was performed. Pooled contamination rates were determined using random effect models. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted to identify factors potentially influencing the rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed. Results Thirty-eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled contamination rates were 15.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8%-21.1%) for S aureus and 5.0% (95% CI, 2.7%-7.7%) for MRSA. The subgroup analyses indicated that the pooled rate of S aureus contamination was significantly higher for studies conducted in South America, in developing countries, and during 2010-2015. The pooled rate of MRSA contamination was significantly higher for studies conducted in Africa. The meta-regression analysis suggested that the pooled rate of S aureus contamination was lower for studies conducted in developed countries (odds ratio,?0.664; 95% CI, 0.509-0.867; P?=?.004). No bias was found in the publication of the rates of S aureus and MRSA contamination. Conclusions S aureus and MRSA contamination statuses of high-touch items are worrisome and should be paid greater attention.

Methods Based on Medline, the Cochrane library, Embase, and the Journal of Robotic Surgery prior to December 30st, 2015, we searched for controlled trials and observational studies. A systematic review with meta-analyses was conducted to compare the clinical efficacy between the da Vinci robotic surgery, open surgery, and laparoscopic surgery for cervical cancer. Data were pooled using the random effects meta-analysis. Results Compared with the open surgery, the robotic surgery for cervical cancer would be advantageous in terms of the length of hospital stay, incidence of complications, volume of blood loss and blood transfusion. The operative time of robotic surgery was longer than that of the open surgery, but the prediction intervals indicated that they could be shorter in future studies. Meanwhile, compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, the robotic surgery could offer more benefits in terms of the length of hospital stay, while no difference was found in terms of the incidence of complications and the volume of blood loss. Conclusions Compared to open surgery, the robotic surgery would be advantageous for cervical cancer patients in terms of the length of hospital stay, the incidence of complications, blood loss and blood transfusion. Compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery, the robotic surgery would result in longer OT, more BL and shorter LOS. The study quality was poor. ? 2017 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

However, the proportion of virological success following antiretroviral therapy (ART) may not be as high as the anticipated 90%, and may in fact be highly heterogeneous. We aimed to describe the proportion of virological success in sub-Saharan Africa and to identify factors associated with the proportion of virological success. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on the proportion of patients in sub-Saharan Africa who demonstrate virological success at 12 and 24 months since ART initiation, as well as at 6 and 36 months, where possible. Programme factors associated with the proportion of virological success were identified using meta-regression. Analyses were conducted using both on-treatment (OT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) approaches. Results: Eighty-five articles were included in the meta-analysis, corresponding to 125 independent study populations. Using an on-treatment approach, the proportions (95% confidence interval (CI)) of virological success at 12 (n = 64) and at 24 (n = 32) months since ART initiation were 87.7% (81.3-91.0) and 83.7% (79.8-87.6), respectively. Univariate analysis indicated that the proportion of virological success was not different by study design. Multivariate analysis at 24 months showed that the proportion of virological success was significantly larger in studies conducted in public sector sites than in other sites (p = 0.045). Using an ITT approach, the proportions (95% CI) of virological success at 12 (n = 50) and at 24 (n = 20) months were 65.4% (61.8-69.1) and 56.8% (51.3-62.4), respectively. At 12 months, multivariate analysis showed that the proportion of success was significantly lower in cohort studies than in trials (63.0% vs. 71.1%; p = 0.017). At 24 months, univariate analysis demonstrated that the proportion of success was also lower in cohorts. Discussion: Regardless of the time following ART initiation, and of the threshold, proportions of virological success were highly variable. Evidence from this review suggests that the new international target of 90% of patients controlled is not yet being achieved, and that in order to improve the virological outcome, efforts should be made to improve retention in care. ? 2017 Taieb et al.

The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan in patients with hyponatremia. Methods: Pertinent studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for articles published between their respective inception dates and 31?April 2016. Summary relative risks (RRs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with their 95?% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using fixed-effects or randomized-effects models, depending on the degree of heterogeneity noted among the studies included in the analysis. Results: Eleven articles comprising 5209 patients were ultimately included in the analysis. Our pooled results showed that tolvaptan was more effective than control with respect to increasing serum sodium concentrations (WMD?=?3.99?mEq/L), 95?% CI 2.80¡V5.19, Z?=?6.56, P?<?0.001), improving serum sodium correction rates (RR?=?3.35, 95?% CI 1.93¡V5.82, Z?=?4.31, P?<?0.001), improving 24-h urine output (WMD?=?987.64?mL, 95?% CI 850.71¡V1124.57, Z?=?14.14, P?<?0.001), and improving net fluid balance (WMD?=?795.97?mL, 95?% CI 418.56¡V1173.38, Z?=?4.13, P?<?0.001). Tolvaptan treatment also resulted in increased incidences of adverse events compared with control treatment (RR?=?1.05, 95?% CI 1.02¡V1.07, Z?=?3.83, P?<?0.001). These events included dry mouth (RR?=?2.38, 95?% CI 1.41¡V4.04, Z?=?3.23, P?=?0.001), thirst (RR?=?3.85, 95?% CI 1.96¡V7.57, Z?=?3.92, P?<?0.001), pollakiuria (RR?=?2.47, 95?% CI 1.41¡V4.33, Z?=?3.16, P?=?0.002), and overly rapid hyponatremia correction (RR?=?8.43, 95?% CI 1.06¡V66.96, Z?=?2.02, P?=?0.04). No significant differences in all-cause mortality (RR?=?0.99, 95?% CI 0.90¡V1.10, Z?=?0.17, P?=?0.86), serious adverse event rate (RR?=?1.01, 95?% CI 0.80¡V1.29, Z?=?0.11, P?=?0.92), systolic blood pressure (WMD?=?0.1?mmHg, 95?% CI ¡V1.04 to 1.23, Z?=?0.17, P?=?0.87), or heart rate (WMD?=?¡V0.16?bpm, 95?% CI ¡V1.14 to 0.82, Z?=?0.31, P?=?0.76) were noted between the two groups, based on the results of our meta-analysis. Conclusion: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that tolvaptan can increase serum sodium concentrations, serum sodium correction rates, 24-h urine output, net fluid balance, and total adverse event rates without significantly decreasing all-cause mortality rates or increasing serious adverse event rates in patients with hyponatremia. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

NAFLD embraces the full spectrum of disease from pure steatosis (i.e. uncomplicated fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), via NASH-cirrhosis to cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment for people with NAFLD remains uncertain. Objectives: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.com to August 2016. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with NAFLD. We excluded trials which included participants who had previously undergone liver transplantation. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo or no intervention. Data collection and analysis: We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on an available participant analysis with Review Manager. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane risk of bias tool, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We identified 77 trials including 6287 participants that met the inclusion criteria of this review. Forty-one trials (3829 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Only one trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. All other trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, all the evidence was very low quality. Thirty-five trials included only participants with non-alcohol related steatohepatitis (NASH) (based on biopsy confirmation). Five trials included only participants with diabetes mellitus; 14 trials included only participants without diabetes mellitus. The follow-up in the trials ranged from one month to 24 months. We present here only the comparisons of active intervention versus no intervention in which two or more trials reported at least one of the following outcomes: mortality at maximal follow-up, serious adverse events, and health-related quality of life, the outcomes that determine whether a treatment should be used. Antioxidants versus no intervention There was no mortality in either group (87 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the trial which reported the proportion of people with serious adverse events (87 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between antioxidants and no intervention (rate ratio 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 254 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Bile acids versus no intervention There was no evidence of difference in mortality at maximal follow-up (OR 5.11, 95% CI 0.24 to 107.34; 659 participants; 4 trials; very low quality evidence), proportion of people with serious adverse events (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.88; 404 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence), or the number of serious adverse events (rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.54; 404 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence) between bile acids and no intervention. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Thiazolidinediones versus no intervention There was no mortality in either group (74 participants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence). None of the participants developed serious adverse events in the two trials which reported the proportion of people with serious adverse events (194 participants; 2 trials; very low quality evidence). There was no evidence of difference in the number of serious adverse events between thiazolidinediones and no intervention (rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.05; 357 participants; 3 trials; very low quality evidence). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life. Source of funding Twenty-six trials were partially- or fully-funded by pharmaceutical companies that would benefit, based on the results of the trial. Twelve trials did not receive any additional funding or were funded by parties with no vested interest in the results. The source of funding was not provided in 39 trials. Authors' conclusions: Due to the very low quality evidence, we are very uncertain about the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for people with NAFLD including those with steatohepatitis.

Apart from chronic HBV infection, the complications related to acute HBV infection are severe acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis characterised by liver failure. The optimal pharmacological treatment of acute HBV infection remains controversial. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions in the treatment of acute HBV infection through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available treatments according to their safety and efficacy. As it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, assessed the benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised clinical trials (RCTs) registers to August 2016 to identify RCTs on pharmacological interventions for acute HBV infection. Selection criteria: RCTs, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status in participants with acute HBV infection. We excluded trials if participants had previously undergone liver transplantation and had other coexisting viral diseases such as hepatitis C virus and HIV. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with each other or with placebo, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis: We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: Seven trials (597 participants) met our review inclusion criteria. All trials provided information for one or more outcomes; however, five participants were excluded from analysis by study authors. All the trials were at high risk of bias. Overall, all the evidence was low or very low quality evidence because of risk of bias (downgraded one level for risk of bias), small sample size (downgraded one level for imprecision), and wide CIs (downgraded one more level for imprecision in some comparisons). Of the seven trials, six were two-armed trials, while one trial was a three-armed trial. The comparisons included hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) versus placebo (one trial; 55 participants); interferon versus placebo (two trials; 200 participants); lamivudine versus placebo or no intervention (four trials; 316 participants); lamivudine versus entecavir (one trial; 90 participants); and entecavir versus no intervention (one trial; 131 participants). One trial included only people with acute HBV with hepatic encephalopathy (i.e. people with fulminant liver failure); one trial included only people with severe acute HBV, but it did not state whether any of the people also had fulminant HBV infection; three trials excluded fulminant HBV infection; and two trials did not report the severity of acute HBV infection. The mean or median follow-up period in the trials ranged from three to 12 months in the trials that provided this information. There was no evidence of any differences in short-term mortality (less than one year) in any of the comparisons: HBIG versus placebo (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.54; participants = 55; 1 trial), lamivudine versus placebo or no intervention (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.33 to 4.99; participants = 250; 2 trials); lamivudine versus entecavir (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.13 to 11.65; participants = 90; 1 trial), or entecavir versus no intervention (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.12 to 9.47; participants = 131; 1 trial). The proportion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection was higher in the lamivudine group than the placebo or no intervention group (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.77; participants = 285; 3 trials) and in the lamivudine group versus entecavir group (OR 3.64, 95% CI 1.31 to 10.13; participants = 90; 1 trial). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of people who progressed to chronic HBV infection between the entecavir and the no intervention groups (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.49; participants = 131; 1 trial). None of the trials reported progression to fulminant HBV infection. Three trials with 371 participants reported serious adverse events. There were no serious adverse events in any of the groups (no intervention: 0/183 (0%), interferon: 0/67 (0%), lamivudine: 0/100 (0%), and entecavir: 0/21 (0%)). The proportion of people with adverse events was higher in the interferon group than the placebo group (OR 348.16, 95% CI 45.39 to 2670.26; participants = 200; 2 trials). There was no evidence of a difference in the proportion of people with adverse events between the lamivudine group and the placebo or no intervention group (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 5.94; participants = 35; 1 trial) or number of adverse events between the lamivudine group and the placebo or no intervention group (rate ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.91; participants = 35; 1 trial). One trial with 100 participants reported quality of life at one week. The scale used to report the health-related quality of life was not stated and lacked information on whether higher score meant better or worse, making it difficult to interpret the results. None of the trials reported quality of life beyond one week or other clinical outcomes such as mortality beyond one year, liver transplantation, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Two trials received funding from pharmaceutical companies; three trials were funded by parties without any vested interest in the results or did not receive any special funding; the source of funding was not available in the remaining two trials. Authors' conclusions: Low or very low quality evidence suggests that progression to chronic HBV infection was higher in people receiving lamivudine compared with placebo, no intervention, or entecavir. Low quality evidence suggests that interferon may increase the adverse events after treatment for acute HBV infection. Based on a very low quality evidence, there is currently no evidence of benefit of any intervention in acute HBV infection. There is significant uncertainty in the results and further RCTs are required. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with a significant reduced risk of all cause infections (RR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.18-0.42), GBS infection (RR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.13-0.44), early-onset GBS infection (RR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.13-0.45), non-GBS infections (RR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.20-0.59), and GBS colonization (RR = 0.10, 95% CI = 0.06-0.16). But no significant reduction was observed in late-onset GBS infection, mortality from early-onset GBS infection or from non-GBS infections. Notably, no significant differences were found between ampicillin and penicillin prevention for neonatal adverse outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing neonatal GBS colonization and infection. ? 2017 Li, Huang, Chen, Guo, Yao and Ye."

The traditional definition of acute HCV infection is the first six months following infection with the virus. Another commonly used definition of acute HCV infection is the absence of HCV antibody and subsequent seroconversion (presence of HCV antibody in a person who was previously negative for HCV antibody). Approximately 40% to 95% of people with acute HCV infection develop chronic HCV infection, that is, have persistent HCV RNA in their blood. In 2010, an estimated 160 million people worldwide (2% to 3% of the world's population) had chronic HCV infection. The optimal pharmacological treatment of acute HCV remains controversial. Chronic HCV infection can damage the liver. Objectives: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of acute HCV infection through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons. Therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis, and instead, we assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions versus each other or versus no intervention using standard Cochrane methodology. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and randomised controlled trials registers to April 2016 to identify randomised clinical trials on pharmacological interventions for acute HCV infection. Selection criteria: We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with acute HCV infection. We excluded trials which included previously liver transplanted participants and those with other coexisting viral diseases. We considered any of the various pharmacological interventions compared with placebo or each other. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) and rate ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models based on the available-participant analysis with Review Manager 5. We assessed risk of bias according to Cochrane, controlled risk of random errors with Trial Sequential Analysis, and assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Main results: We identified 10 randomised clinical trials with 488 randomised participants that met our inclusion criteria. All the trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains. Overall, the evidence for all the outcomes was very low quality evidence. Nine trials (467 participants) provided information for one or more outcomes. Three trials (99 participants) compared interferon-alpha versus no intervention. Three trials (90 participants) compared interferon-beta versus no intervention. One trial (21 participants) compared pegylated interferon-alpha versus no intervention, but it did not provide any data for analysis. One trial (41 participants) compared MTH-68/B vaccine versus no intervention. Two trials (237 participants) compared pegylated interferon-alpha versus pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin. None of the trials compared direct-acting antivirals versus placebo or other interventions. The mean or median follow-up period in the trials ranged from six to 36 months. There was no short-term mortality (less than one year) in any group in any trial except for one trial where one participant died in the pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin group (1/95: 1.1%). In the trials that reported follow-up beyond one year, there were no further deaths. The number of serious adverse events was higher with pegylated interferon-alpha plus ribavirin than with pegylated interferon-alpha (rate ratio 2.74, 95% CI 1.40 to 5.33; participants = 237; trials = 2; I2 = 0%). The proportion of people with any adverse events was higher with interferon-alpha and interferon-beta compared with no intervention (OR 203.00, 95% CI 9.01 to 4574.81; participants = 33; trials = 1 and OR 27.88, 95% CI 1.48 to 526.12; participants = 40; trials = 1). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, liver transplantation, decompensated liver disease, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. The proportion of people with chronic HCV infection as indicated by the lack of sustained virological response was lower in the interferon-alpha group versus no intervention (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.76; participants = 99; trials = 3; I2 = 0%). The differences between the groups were imprecise or not estimable (because neither group had any events) for all the remaining comparisons. Four of the 10 trials (40%) received financial or other assistance from pharmaceutical companies who would benefit from the findings of the research; the source of funding was not available in five trials (50%), and one trial (10%) was funded by a hospital. Authors' conclusions: Very low quality evidence suggests that interferon-alpha may decrease the incidence of chronic HCV infection as measured by sustained virological response. However, the clinical impact such as improvement in health-related quality of life, reduction in cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and liver transplantation has not been reported. It is also not clear whether this finding is applicable in the current clinical setting dominated by the use of pegylated interferons and direct-acting antivirals, although we found no evidence to support that pegylated interferons or ribavirin or both are effective in people with acute HCV infection. We could find no randomised trials comparing direct-acting antivirals with placebo or other interventions for acute HCV infection. There is significant uncertainty in the benefits and harms of the interventions, and high-quality randomised clinical trials are required. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Methods A systematic search is carried out through Medline (1966¡V2016.11), PubMed (1966¡V2016.11), Embase (1980¡V2016.11), ScienceDirect (1985¡V2016.11) and the Cochrane Library. Only high quality studies are identified. Meta-analysis is conducted with the use of Stata 11.0 software. Results One RCT and five retrospective studies, published between 2010 and 2016, are included in the present meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis indicates that there are significant differences in surgical site infection rate (RD?=??0.02, 95% CI:??0.02 to??0.01, P?<?0.00001), revision surgery rate (RD?=??0.01, 95% CI:??0.01 to??0.01, P?<?0.00001) and length of stay (MD?=??0.29, 95% CI:??0.48 to??0.11, P?=?0.002) between groups. Conclusion Preoperative chlorhexidine skin preparation appears to reduce the risk of infection, the incidence of revision surgery, and the length of stay for patients undergoing total knee and hip arthroplasty. No adverse effects, such as DVT or PE, appear to be related to chlorhexidine preparation.

Aim To undertake a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of studies investigating the effectiveness of antiseptic cleaning before urinary catheter insertion and during catheter use for prevention of CAUTIs. Methods Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and compared across intervention and control groups using DerSimonian¡VLaird random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed. Heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic. Findings In total, 2665 potential papers were identified; of these, 14 studies were eligible for inclusion. There was no difference in the incidence of CAUTIs when comparing antiseptic and non-antiseptic agents (pooled OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73¡V1.10; P=0.31), or when comparing different agents: povidone-iodine vs routine care; povidone-iodine vs soap and water; chlorhexidine vs water; povidone-iodine vs saline; povidone-iodine vs water; and green soap and water vs routine care (P&gt;0.05 for all). Comparison of an antibacterial agent with routine care indicated near significance (P=0.06). There was no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%; P&gt;0.05).

So we did this meta-analysis to evaluate the outcomes of ExFx and ORIF in managing complex tibial plateau fractures. Methods Articles published before August 5, 2016 were selected from PubMed, Cochrane library, and some other electronic database. Relevant journals were also searched manually with no language limited. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed the literature. A fixed effect model was initially used for meta-analyses with RevMan 5.3. Results When compared with ORIF, cases undergoing ExFx were more likely to return to the preinjury state at the early stage, but no difference in the later period of follow-up. However, ExFx group had higher infection rate (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.08¡V3.63, P?=?0.03), higher venous thromboembolism rate (OR 1.56, 95% CI 0.49¡V4.96, P?=?0.45), higher re-operation rate (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.47¡V1.62, P?=?0.66) and lower compartment syndrome rate (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.12¡V3.22, P?=?0.56), lower TKA rate (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.20¡V1.34, P?=?0.17). There were no statistically significant differences in the rate of deep infection, venous thromboembolism, compartment syndrome and VTE between the two groups. Conclusion Although external fixation may offer some advantages, both were acceptable strategies in managing complex tibial plateau fractures. According to our analysis results, we strongly recommend that selection of definitive fixators should base on the fracture patterns, soft-tissue condition as well as the injury stages in clinical practice. More important, further multicentered, randomized controlled studies should be implemented to get a more reliable and clear result. ? 2017"

Historically, muscle flaps were favored as they provide vascular tissue to an infected wound bed. However, data comparing the performance of muscle versus fasciocutaneous flaps are limited and reflect a lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these wounds. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of muscle versus fasciocutaneous flaps following the salvage of compromised TKA. Methods A systematic search and meta-analysis were performed to identify patients with TKA who underwent either pedicled muscle or fasciocutaneous flap coverage of periprosthetic knee defects. Studies evaluating implant/limb salvage rates, ambulatory function, complications, and donor-site morbidity were included in the comparative analysis. Results A total of 18 articles, corresponding to 172 flaps (119 muscle flaps and 53 fasciocutaneous flaps) were reviewed. Rates of implant salvage (88.8% vs. 90.1%, P=0.05) and limb salvage (89.8% vs. 100%, P=0.14) were comparable in each cohort. While overall complication rates were similar (47.3% vs. 44%, P=0.78), the rates of persistent infection (16.4% vs. 0%, P=0.14) and recurrent infection (9.1% vs. 4%, P=0.94) tended to be higher in the muscle flap cohort. Notably, functional outcomes and ambulation rates were sparingly reported. Conclusions Rates of limb and prosthetic salvage were comparable following muscle or fasciocutaneous flap coverage of compromised TKA. The functional morbidity associated with muscle flap harvest, however, may support the use of fasciocutaneous flaps for coverage of these defects, particularly in young patients and/or high-performance athletes. ? 2017 The Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons."

The objective of this work was to determine the efficacy of Bifidobacterium (B.) animalis ssp. lactis HN019 (HN019) supplementation on cellular immune activity in healthy elderly subjects. We conducted a systematic review of Medline and Embase for controlled trials that reported polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell phagocytic capacity or natural killer (NK) cell tumoricidal activity following B. lactis HN019 consumption in the elderly. A random effects meta-analysis was performed with standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval between probiotic and control groups for each outcome. A total of four clinical trials were included in this analysis. B. lactis HN019 supplementation was highly efficacious in increasing PMN phagocytic capacity with an SMD of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 1.11, p < 0.001) and moderately efficacious in increasing NK cell tumoricidal activity with an SMD of 0.43 (95% confidence interval: 0.08 to 0.78, p = 0.02). The main limitations of this research were the small number of included studies, short-term follow-up, and assessment of a single probiotic strain. In conclusion, daily consumption of B. lactis HN019 enhances NK cell and PMN function in healthy elderly adults. ? 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Over the past decades, rifaximin has gained popularity for this indication despite its use is not evidence based. Aim: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise evidence about the efficacy and safety of rifaximin to eradicate SIBO in adult patients. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CCRCT, Scopus and Web of Science were searched from inception to March 16, 2015 for RCTs and observational studies. Furthermore, abstract books of major European, American and Asian gastroenterological meetings were also examined. Results: Thirty-two studies involving 1331 patients were included. The overall eradication rate according to intention-to-treat analysis was 70.8% (95% CI: 61.4¡V78.2; I2 = 89.4%) and to per protocol analysis 72.9% (95% CI: 65.5¡V79.8; I2 = 87.5%). Meta-regression identified three covariates (drug dose, study design and co-therapy) independently associated with an increased eradication rate.

However, the comparative effectiveness of different dressings has not been studied. We report the protocol of a network meta-analysis designed to combine direct and indirect evidence of wound dressings in the management of PTB. Methods and analysis We will search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the wound-healing effect of a wound dressing in the management of PTB. Searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register and CINAHL. A comprehensive search strategy is developed to retrieve articles reporting potentially eligible RCTs. Besides, we will contact the experts in the field and review the conference proceedings to locate non-published studies. The reference lists of articles will be reviewed for any candidate studies. Two independent reviewers will screen titles and abstracts of the candidate articles. All eligible RCTs will be obtained in full text to perform a review. Disagreement on eligibility of an RCT will be solved by group discussion. The information of participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes from included RCTs will be recorded and summarised. The primary outcome is time to complete wound healing. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of burns completely healed at the end of treatment, change in wound surface area at the end of treatment, incidence of adverse events, etc. Ethics and dissemination The result of this review will provide evidence for the comparative effectiveness of different wound dressings in the management of PTB.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) have analyzed safety-related outcomes but have not specified risk in the elderly, the population at highest risk for AEs. The aim of this review is to explore and evaluate AEs and treatment discontinuations in adults 65 or older taking antimuscarinics for OAB. Methods Keywords were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) along with sub-analyses and pooled analyses that compared antimuscarinics to placebo or another antimuscarinic were performed in February 2015. Studies assessing AEs or treatment discontinuations in a population of adults 65 or older were included. The Jadad Criteria and McHarm Tool were used to assess the quality of the trials. Results A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighty AEs and 27 reasons for treatment discontinuation were described in the included studies and further explored. Anticholinergic AEs were more common in antimuscarinics compared to placebo. Incidence of dizziness, dyspepsia, and urinary retention with fesoterodine, headache with darifenacin, and urinary tract infections with solifenacin were significantly higher compared to placebo. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs and dry mouth were higher in the antimuscarinics when compared to placebo in older adults. Conclusions Treatment for overactive bladder using antimuscarinics in adults aged 65 or older resulted in significant increases in risk for several AEs compared to placebo including anticholinergic and non-anticholinergic AEs. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

In addition, previous systematic reviews seldom focused on quality of life and cost-effectiveness related to mesh placement. Therefore, an updated meta-analysis was performed to clarify quality of life, cost-effectiveness, the safety, and effectiveness of mesh reinforcement in preventing the incidence of IH. Methods Embase, Pubmed, and the Cochrane library were searched from the inception to May 2016 without language limitation for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which explored mesh reinforcement for the prevention of IH in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries. Results Twelve RCTs totaling 1661 patients (958 in mesh, 703 in nonmesh) were included in our study. Compared with nonmesh, mesh reinforcement can effectively decrease the incidence of IH (relative risk: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09-0.42). Besides, mesh placement was associated with improved quality of life, a higher rate of seroma (relative risk: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.13-2.37), and longer operating time (mean difference: 17.62; 95% CI: 1.44-33.80). No difference can be found between both groups in postoperative overall morbidity, systemic postoperative morbidity, wound-related morbidity, surgical site infection, hematoma, wound disruption, postoperative mortality, and length of hospital stay. Conclusions Prophylactic mesh reinforcement may be effective and safe to prevent the formation of IH after abdominal surgery, without impairing quality of life. Thus, preventive mesh should be routinely recommended in high-risk patients. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Face-lift and rhytidoplasty may cause several complications such as haematoma, ecchymosis, oedema, seroma, skin necrosis, wound dehiscence and wound infection. However, administration of tissue sealants may prevent the occurrence of some complications. We performed a meta-analysis of studies that compared tissue sealant use with controls to evaluate the outcomes. A systematic literature search was performed. The primary outcome was the incidence of haematoma. Secondary outcomes were wound drainage amount, oedema, ecchymosis, seroma, skin necrosis and hypertrophic scarring. Thirteen studies involving 2434 patients were retrieved and included in the present analysis. A statistically significantly decrease in post-operative haematoma [risk ratio (RR), 0.37; 95% CI, 0.18¡V0.74; p?=?0.005] and wound drainage (MD, ?16.90, 95% CI?=??25.71, ?8.08, p?<?0.001) was observed with tissue sealant use.

We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence on zoster and risk of occult cancer. Methods Through February 18, 2016, we searched PubMed, EMBASE and references of relevant papers for studies on zoster and risk of any cancer. One author screened retrieved papers by title and abstract; included papers were reviewed by two authors for eligibility, data extraction, and potential biases. Despite statistical heterogeneity, associations were consistently in the same direction and we therefore computed pooled relative risks using random-effects models. Results We identified 46 eligible studies, 10 of which considered all cancer types combined. The pooled relative risk for any cancer was 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.71) overall and 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.87) at one year after zoster. Considering cancer subtypes, the highest estimates were generally reported for occult hematological cancer. The absolute risk of any cancer at one year after presentation with zoster was 0.7¡V1.8%.

While there has been a recent surge in acupuncture use and research, little remains known about its effects on nerve function. This review aims to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of neuropathy of various etiologies. Methods: The Medline, AMED, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL, and clintrials.gov databases were systematically searched from inception to July 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing acupuncture's efficacy for poly- and mononeuropathy were reviewed. Parallel and crossover RCTs focused on acupuncture's efficacy were reviewed and screened for eligibility. The Scale for Assessing Scientific Quality of Investigations in Complementary and Alternative Medicine was used to assess RCT quality. RCTs with score of >9 and active control treatments such as sham acupuncture or medical therapy were included. Results: Fifteen studies were included: 13 original RCTs, a long-term follow-up, and a re-analysis of a prior RCT. The selected RCTs studied acupuncture for neuropathy caused by diabetes, Bell's palsy, carpal tunnel syndrome, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and idiopathic conditions. Acupuncture regimens, control conditions, and outcome measures differed among studies, and various methodological issues were identified. Still, the majority of RCTs showed benefit for acupuncture over control in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, Bell's palsy, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Acupuncture is probably effective in the treatment of HIV-related neuropathy, and there is insufficient evidence for its benefits in idiopathic neuropathy. Acupuncture appears to improve nerve conduction study parameters in both sensory and motor nerves. Meta-analyses were conducted on all diabetic neuropathy and Bell's palsy individual subject data (six RCTs; a total of 680 subjects) using a summary estimate random effects model, which showed combined odds ratio of 4.23 (95% confidence interval 2.3-7.8; p < 0.001) favoring acupuncture over control for neuropathic symptoms. Conclusions: Acupuncture is beneficial in some peripheral neuropathies, but more rigorously designed studies using sham-acupuncture control are needed to characterize its effect and optimal use better. ?

This review aimed to assess the risk of TB in patients undergoing TNF-£\ antagonists treatment. Methods: A systematic literature search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane library and studies selected for inclusion according to predefined criteria. ORs with 95% CIs were calculated using the randomeffect model. Subgroup analyses considered the effects of drug type, disease and TB endemicity. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: 29 RCTs involving 11 879 patients were included (14 for infliximab, 9 for adalimumab, 2 for golimumab, 1 for etanercept and 3 for certolizumab pegol). Of 7912 patients allocated to TNF-£\ antagonists, 45 (0.57%) developed TB, while only 3 cases occurred in 3967 patients allocated to control groups, resulting in an OR of 1.94 (95% CI 1.10 to 3.44, p=0.02). Subgroup analyses indicated that patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a higher increased risk of TB when treated with TNF-£\ antagonists (OR 2.29 (1.09 to 4.78), p=0.03). The level of the evidence was recommended as 'low' by the GRADE system.

This meta-analysis sought to determine the current role of preoperative IABP support. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized (RCT) and observational trials (OT) that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) Group comparison of patients with prophylactic IABP implantation before CABG with a control group; (2) reporting at least one desired clinical endpoint, including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and renal failure. Pooled treatment effects (odds ratio [OR] or weighted mean difference, and 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]) were assessed using a fixed or random effects model. RESULTS: A total of 9,212 patients from 23 studies (7 RCT, 16 OT) were identified after a literature search of major databases using a predefined keyword list. Absolute risk reduction for mortality in RCTs was 4.4% (OR 0.43; 95%CI 0.25-0.73; p = 0.0025).

We sought to determine whether the obesity paradox observed in cardiac surgery is attributable to reverse epidemiology, bias, or confounding. Methods: Data from the National Adult Cardiac Surgery registry for all cardiac surgical procedures performed between April 2002 and March 2013 were extracted. A parallel systematic review and meta-analysis (MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library) through June 2015 were also accomplished. Exposure of interest was body mass index categorized into 6 groups according to the World Health Organization classification. Results: A total of 401 227 adult patients in the cohort study and 557 720 patients in the systematic review were included. A U-shaped association between mortality and body mass index classes was observed in both studies, with lower mortality in overweight (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.83) and obese class I and II (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.86; and odds ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.94) patients relative to normal-weight patients and increased mortality in underweight individuals (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-1.62). In the cohort study, a U-shaped relationship was observed for stroke and low cardiac output syndrome but not for renal replacement therapy or deep sternal wound infection. Counter to the reverse epidemiology hypotheses, the protective effects of obesity were less in patients with severe chronic renal, lung, or cardiac disease and greater in older patients and in those with complications of obesity, including the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adjustments for important confounders did not alter our results. Conclusions: Obesity is associated with lower risks after cardiac surgery, with consistent effects noted in multiple analyses attempting to address residual confounding and reverse causation. ? 2017 American Heart Association, Inc."

It was still indeterminate whether short-segment (SS) fixation was more effective and preferable than long-segment (LS) fixation. We therefore conducted this meta-analysis to assess the comparative safety and efficacy of SS and LS fixation for the treatment of thoracolumbar burst fracture. Methods: A literature search was conducted between January 1990 and September 2014. The sources of electronic searching included EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Ovid, Cochrane Library and Springer. Study eligibility was based on predefined criteria. The data were extracted by two authors independently and were managed using the Review Manager (RevMan) 5.2. A meta-analysis was conducted under the suggestion of PRISMA guideline standards. Results: Finally only 8 eligible articles were included in the current study, including a total of 455 thoracolumbar burst fracture patients who underwent the treatment with SS fixation (n=239) and LS fixation (n=216). The outcomes of this study indicated that final outcome in regard to implant failure, anterior body height loss (ABHL), cobb angle (CA) and restoration ratio of compromised canal is better in the LS fixation group than those of SS fixation group. However, SS group significantly reduced surgical time when compared with LS group. There was no significant difference regarding blood loss, complication rate, Sagittal Index (SI) and kyphotic angle (KA). Conclusions: The main results of radiographic indexes and implant failure are better in the LS fixation group than those of SS fixation group. Nevertheless, LS fixation prolonged the duration of operation. Clinical outcomes suggested that there was no difference between the SS and LS fixation. The choice of the appropriate method has to be made cautiously and on an individualized basis. ? 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved."

Methods: We reviewed experimental and observational studies; exposure was maternal HIV antiretroviral therapy (and duration) and infant feeding modality; outcomes were overall and postnatal HIV transmission rates in the infant at 6, 9, 12 and 18 months. English literature from 2005 to 2015 was systematically searched in multiple electronic databases. Papers were analysed by narrative synthesis; data were pooled in random effects meta-analyses. Postnatal transmission was assessed from four to six weeks of life. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and GRADE. Results and discussion: Eleven studies were identified, from 1439 citations and review of 72 abstracts. Heterogeneity in study methodology and pooled estimates was considerable. Overall pooled transmission rates at 6 months for breastfed infants with mothers on antiretroviral treatment (ART) was 3.54% (95% CI: 1.15-5.93%) and at 12 months 4.23% (95% CI: 2.97-5.49%). Postnatal transmission rates were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.32-1.85) at six and 2.93 (95% CI: 0.68-5.18) at 12 months. ART was mostly provided for PMTCT only and did not continue beyond six months postpartum. No study provided data on mixed feeding and transmission risk. Conclusions: There is evidence of substantially reduced postnatal HIV transmission risk under the cover of maternal ART. However, transmission risk increased once PMTCT ART stopped at six months, which supports the current World Health Organization recommendations of life-long ART for all. ? 2017 Bispo S et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

OBJECTIVE To systematically review the incidence of VRE infection in the United States and the clinical and economic outcomes. METHODS We searched various databases for US studies published from January 1, 2000, through June 8, 2015, that evaluated incidence, mortality, length of stay, discharge to a long-term care facility, readmission, recurrence, or costs attributable to VRE infections. We included multicenter studies that evaluated incidence and single-center and multicenter studies that evaluated outcomes. We kept studies that did not have a denominator or uninfected controls only if they assessed postinfection length of stay, costs, or recurrence. We performed meta-analysis to pool the mortality data. RESULTS Five studies provided incidence data and 13 studies evaluated outcomes or costs. The incidence of VRE infections increased in Atlanta and Detroit but did not increase in national samples. Compared with uninfected controls, VRE infection was associated with increased mortality (pooled odds ratio, 2.55), longer length of stay (3-4.6 days longer or 1.4 times longer), increased risk of discharge to a long-term care facility (2.8- to 6.5-fold) or readmission (2.9-fold), and higher costs ($9,949 higher or 1.6-fold more). CONCLUSIONS VRE infection is associated with large attributable burdens, including excess mortality, prolonged in-hospital stay, and increased treatment costs. Multicenter studies that use suitable controls and adjust for time at risk or confounders are needed to estimate the burden of VRE infections. ? 2016 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America."

One of the practices to reduce their incidence is preoperative skin antisepsis. Two of the most commonly active components used are chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine. Of 3 reviews conducted between 2010 and 2012 comparing antiseptics, 2 were in favor of chlorhexidine; however, the latest was unable to draw conclusions. Purpose To verify whether recent evidence supports the hypothesis that chlorhexidine in preoperative antisepsis is more efficient than other antiseptics in reducing SSI rates. Procedures We conducted a systematic review from 2000-2014 in all languages. The primary end point was SSI incidence and secondary skin bacterial colonization. Results Nineteen studies were included. Meta-analysis were conducted for comparable studies for both outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis, including all of the studies in which chlorhexidine was compared with iodophor, were in favor of chlorhexidine for both SSI incidence (risk ratio [RR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.92) and bacterial skin colonization (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.36-0.55). Conclusions There is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of chlorhexidine for preoperative skin antisepsis and high-quality evidence that the use of chlorhexidine is associated with fewer positive skin cultures.

Cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C is one of the most common causes of liver transplantation. Therefore, determining the prevalence of HCV infection and its geographical distribution is essential. Objectives: The aim of this study was to estimate the point prevalence of HCV infection among Iranian general population. Methods: Published studies reporting the prevalence of HCV infection in the Iranian general population were identified by a comprehensive literature search. Studies assessing and reporting HCV Ab positivity were evaluated in this review. Furthermore, an additional grey-literature search was performed to obtain other relevant studies. Results: Twelve studies were eligible for inclusion in this review. The overall seroprevalence of HCV was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.4% to 0.8%). The seroprevalence of HCV infection varied considerably among different provinces ranging from 0.08% to 1.6%. Hormozgan province was reported to have the highest HCV Ab seropositivity rate while Mazandaran province had the lowest rate. The overall prevalence of actual viremia was 0.4% (range = 0.05 0.87), based on the results of five studies using PCR for confirmation of HCV diagnosis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the seroprevalence of HCV among Iranian general population is lower compared to other countries in the middle-east. However, the significant heterogeneity across included studies limits this conclusion. Therefore, to reduce the existing heterogeneity in the literature and strengthen the current evidence on the prevalence of HCV infection among Iranian general population, further high quality studies are required. ? 2017, Kowsar Corp."

In this meta-Analysis, we aimed to clarify this association. Material and methods The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for studies published from their inception to January 2016. Two investigators independently extracted the data. The pooled relative risk (RR) was calculated using a random effects model. Results A total of 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. During the first 1 month after herpes zoster infection, the pooled RRs for ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke were 1.55 (95% CI, 1.46¡Ó1.65) and 1.70 (95% CI, 0.73¡Ó3.96), respectively, and within 3 months after infection, the corresponding RRs were 1.17 (95% CI, 1.12¡Ó1.23) and 2.05 (95% CI, 1.17¡Ó3.60), respectively. At 1 year and more than 1 year after herpes zoster infection, a significant relationship was not observed between herpes zoster infection and the incidence of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

Safety concerns focus on the potential for hyperglycemia and increased infection. The authors hypothesized that glucocorticoids predispose to such adverse outcomes in a dose-dependent fashion after elective noncardiac surgery. Methods: The authors conducted a systematic literature search of the major medical databases from their inception to April 2016. Randomized glucocorticoid trials in adults specifically reporting on a safety outcome were included and meta-analyzed with Peto odds ratio method or the quality effects model. Subanalyses were performed according to a dexamethasone dose equivalent of low (less than 8 mg), medium (8 to 16 mg), and high (more than 16 mg). The primary endpoints of any wound infection and peak perioperative glucose concentrations were subject to meta-regression. Results: Fifty-six trials from 18 countries were identified, predominantly assessing dexamethasone. Glucocorticoids did not impact on any wound infection (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.2) but did result in a clinically unimportant increase in peak perioperative glucose concentration (weighted mean difference, 20.0 mg/dl; CI, 11.4 to 28.6; P < 0.001 or 1.1 mM; CI, 0.6 to 1.6). Glucocorticoids reduced peak postoperative C-reactive protein concentrations (weighted mean difference, -22.1 mg/l; CI, -31.7 to -12.5; P < 0.001), but other adverse outcomes and length of stay were unchanged. No dose-effect relationships were apparent. Conclusions: The evidence at present does not highlight any safety concerns with respect to the use of perioperative glucocorticoids and subsequent infection, hyperglycemia, or other adverse outcomes. Nevertheless, collated trials lacked sufficient surveillance and power to detect clinically important differences in complications such as wound infection."

Methods: The literature was systematically searched using PubMed from inception through April 2016. Studies were limited to cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies reporting colectomy risk stratified by CDI in patients with IBD. We estimated summary ORs and 95% CIs using the quality-effects model. Study quality was assessed using an adaptation of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Results: Six studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 8 data sets. Results from meta-analysis showed that CDI was a significant risk factor for colectomy among patients with IBD, mainly patients with ulcerative colitis, almost doubling the odds (OR 1.90; 95% CI, 1.23-2.93). There was significant heterogeneity across studies (Q = 22.02, P &lt; 0.001; I2 = 68%). Funnel plots were grossly asymmetrical. Results of sensitivity analysis restricting studies to those reporting ulcerative colitis only and studies using laboratory tests to confirm CDI were consistent with the result from the main analysis.

Methods We systematically reviewed articles from 1994 to 2015. The reports which contained the prevalence and etiology of acute bacterial meningitis by valid clinical and laboratory diagnosis were comprised in the present study. Results Our analysis indicated that Streptococcus pneumoniae (30% [I2 = 56% p < 0.01]), Haemophilus influenza type b (15% [I2 = 82.75% p < 0.001]), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (14% [I2 = 60.5% p < 0.06]), and Neisseria meningitidis (13% [I2 = 74.16% p < 0.001]) were the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis among meningitis cases in Iran. Notably, high frequency rates of nosocomial meningitis pathogens were detected in the present analysis. Conclusions It was magnificently attained that the majority of cases for bacterial meningitis in Iran could be avertable by public immunization schemes and by preventive care to inhibit the broadening of hospital acquired pathogens. ? 2017 Houri et al.

A systematic review of the literature was performed on PubMed until June 2016, according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. All randomised controlled trials comparing laparoscopic lavage with surgical resection, irrespective of anastomosis or stoma formation, were analysed. After assessment of titles and full text, 3 randomised trials fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall the quality of evidence was low because of serious concerns regarding the risk of bias and imprecision. In the laparoscopic lavage group, there was a statistically significant higher rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess (RR 2.54, 95% CI 1.34¡V4.83), a lower rate of postoperative wound infection (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.02¡V0.51), and a shorter length of postoperative hospital stay during index admission (WMD?=??2.03, 95% CI ?2.59 to ?1.47). There were no statistically significant differences in terms of postoperative mortality at index admission or within 30?days from intervention in all Hinchey stages and in Hinchey stage III, postoperative mortality at 12?months, surgical reintervention at index admission or within 30¡V90?days from index intervention, stoma rate at 12?months, or adverse events within 90?days of any Clavien¡VDindo grade. The surgical reintervention rate at 12?months from index intervention was significantly lower in the laparoscopic lavage group (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38¡V0.86), but these data included emergency reintervention and planned intervention (stoma reversal). This systematic review and meta-analysis did not demonstrate any significant difference between laparoscopic peritoneal lavage and traditional surgical resection in patients with peritonitis from perforated diverticular disease, in terms of postoperative mortality and early reoperation rate. Laparoscopic lavage was associated with a lower rate of stoma formation. However, the finding of a significantly higher rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess in patients who underwent laparoscopic lavage compared to those who underwent surgical resection is of concern. Since the aim of surgery in patients with peritonitis is to treat the sepsis, if one technique is associated with more postoperative abscesses, then the technique is ineffective. Even so, laparoscopic lavage does not appear fundamentally inferior to traditional surgical resection and this technique may achieve reasonable outcomes with minimal invasiveness. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG."

Methods Using PubMed, Ovid, Embase, and Cochrane library databases, we searched for papers written between January 1995 and October 2015 that contained the following search terms: ¡§one-stage or two-stage¡¨ or ¡§simultaneous or staged,¡¨ and ¡§hip¡¨ and ¡§arthroplasty or replacement.¡¨ A meta-analysis was conducted with the collected pooled data about major and minor systemic complications, surgical complications, and other perioperative data associated with 1- and 2-stage bilateral THA. Statistical analysis was performed by the Mantel-Haenszel method, and the fixed effect model was used to analyze data. Results There were 13 studies with 17,762 patients who underwent 1-stage bilateral THA and 46,147 patients who underwent 2-stage bilateral THA. One-stage bilateral THA had a lower risk of major systemic complications, less deep venous thrombosis, and shorter operative time compared with 2-stage bilateral THA. There were no significant differences in death, pulmonary embolism, cardiovascular complication, infections, minor complications, and other surgical complications between procedures. Conclusion One-stage bilateral THA was superior to 2-stage bilateral THA in terms of major systemic complication, deep venous thrombosis, and surgical time compared with 2-stage bilateral THA. However, this study does not encourage performing 1-stage over 2-stage bilateral THA. Higher evidence level studies are necessary for further analysis. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The aims of this study were to identify models used to predict mortality in VAP patients and to assess their prognostic accuracy. Methods The PubMed and EMBASE were searched in February 2016. We included studies in English that evaluated models¡¦ ability to predict the risk of mortality in patients with VAP. The reported mortality with the longest follow-up was used in the meta-analysis. Prognostic accuracy was measured with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results We identified 19 articles studying 7 different models¡¦ ability to predict mortality in VAP patients. The models were Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II (9 studies, n = 1398); Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (4 studies, n = 303); ¡§Immunodeficiency, Blood pressure, Multilobular infiltrates on chest radiograph, Platelets and hospitalization 10 days before onset of VAP¡¨ (3 studies, n = 406); ¡§VAP Predisposition, Insult Response and Organ dysfunction¡¨ (2 studies, n = 589); Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (7 studies, n = 1019); Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (6 studies, n = 1043); and APACHE III (1 study, n = 198). APACHE II had the highest pooled AUC (95% confidence intervals), 0.72 (0.64-0.80), and CPIS had the lowest pooled AUC, 0.64 (0.55-0.72). Conclusion We identified 7 models that have been evaluated for their ability to predict mortality in patients with VAP. The models had nearly equal predictive accuracies, although some models are more complex and time consuming. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Methods Relevant cohort studies were identified through a literature search in PubMed, Embase, and Ovid from 1985 to October 1, 2016. Appropriate studies were identified per search criteria. Systematic review and meta-analysis were used to assess the diagnostic success rate, changed management rate, clinical improvement rate, mortality rate, morbidity rate, hemorrhage rate, hemorrhage in morbidity rate, and final histologic diagnosis results. Study-specific outcomes were combined per a random effects model. Outcomes were compared between the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and post-HAART groups. Correlations between outcomes were assessed via meta-regression analysis. Results A total of 19 cohort studies with 820 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The weighted proportions per the random effects model were 92.2% (95% confidence interval [CI; 89.3%¡V94.5%]) for diagnostic success rate, 5.1% (95% CI [2.5%¡V8.3%]) for morbidity, and 0.7% (95% CI [0%¡V1.9%]) for mortality.

Hyperuricaemia and increased BR levels were observed in thalassemia. In order to evaluate the differences in TAC values between thalassemic patients and healthy subjects, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies. After the exclusion of data deemed unsuitable for meta-analysis inclusion and a study imputed of bias by Trim-and-fill analysis, mean difference (MD) and confidence intervals 95% (CI 95%) were calculated by the random effect model for beta-thalassemia major (BTM) (1351 subjects: 770 thalassemic and 581 controls, from 15 studies) and Trait (BTT) or Hemoglobin E (BTE) (475 subjects: 165 thalassemic and 310 controls, from 5 studies). Despite the differences in clinical symptoms and severity, similar decreased levels of TAC were found in BTM [MD ?0.22 (?0.35 ?0.09) p?<?0.001] and BTT or BTE [MD ?0.22 (?0.44 ?0.01) p?<?0.05].

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the beneficial effect and safety of acupoint herbal patching (AHP) at Shenque (CV8) as an adjunctive therapy for acute diarrhea in children. Methods We searched for published or registered randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in seven databases (from their inception to September 30, 2016) and three clinical trial registries that compared combined therapy of AHP applied at Shenque together with conventional treatments to conventional treatments alone. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers. Stata 12.0 was used for statistical analyses. Results 21 eligible studies involving 3560 children with acute diarrhea were included. All of the RCTs were generally of poor methodological quality. Compared with conventional treatments which included symptomatic treatment (fluid supplementation, nutritional management, adsorbents, probiotics, etc.) and anti-infection therapy (antibiotics or antiviral drugs), AHP at Shenque as adjuvant therapy reduced mean duration of diarrhea (MD = ?36.49 h, 95% confidence interval ?47.50 to ?25.49) and decreased the risk of treatment failure (RR = 0.21, 95% confidence interval 0.17 to 0.27) at 72 h after treatment began without any reports of serious adverse events. Conclusions AHP applied at Shenque (CV8) as an adjunct therapy seemed to be a therapeutic choice in the management of diarrhea in children. However, a robust conclusion could not be drawn. Future clinical trials should be designed more rigorously. ? 2017 The Authors"

Previous systematic reviews suggested that prophylactic mesh reduces the rate of parastomal hernia; however, a larger trial has recently called this into question. The aim was to determine whether mesh placed at the time of primary stoma creation prevents parastomal hernia. Methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL were searched using medical subject headings for parastomal hernia, mesh and prevention. Reference lists of identified studies, clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry were also searched. All randomized clinical trials were included. Two authors extracted data from each study independently using a purpose-designed sheet. Risk of bias was assessed by a tool based on that developed by Cochrane. Results: Ten randomized trials were identified among 150 studies screened. In total 649 patients were included in the analysis (324 received mesh). Overall the rates of parastomal hernia were 53 of 324 (16?4 per cent) in the mesh group and 119 of 325 (36?6 per cent) in the non-mesh group (odds ratio 0?24, 95 per cent c.i. 0?12 to 0?50; P < 0?001). Mesh reduced the rate of parastomal hernia repair by 65 (95 per cent c.i. 28 to 85) per cent (P = 0?02). There were no differences in rates of parastomal infection, stomal stenosis or necrosis. Mesh type and position, and study quality did not have an independent effect on this relationship. Conclusion: Mesh placed prophylactically at the time of stoma creation reduced the rate of parastomal hernia, without an increase in mesh-related complications. ? 2016 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting: Primary care setting. Participants: Of 1568 studies screened, 14 studies with 7035 PWID were included. Measures: PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, CENTRAL and Cochrane review databases were searched without language restriction from their inception to 27 January 2016. All published study designs with control groups that reported the effectiveness of pharmacy-based NSP on outcomes of interest were included. Outcomes of interest are risk behaviour (RB), HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence and economic outcomes. The estimates of pooled effects of these outcomes were calculated as pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and £q2 tests. Findings: Most studies (nine of 14, 64.3%) were rated as having a serious risk of bias, while 28.6 and 7.1% were rated as having a moderate risk and low risk of bias, respectively. For sharing-syringe behaviour, pharmacy-based NSPs were significantly better than no NSPs for both main (OR?=?0.50, 95% CI?=?0.34¡V0.73; I2?=?59.6%) and sensitivity analyses, excluding studies with a serious risk of bias (OR?=?0.52, 95% CI?=?0.32¡V0.84; I2?=?41.4%). For safe syringe disposal and HIV/HCV prevalence, the evidence for pharmacy-based NSPs compared with other NSP or no NSP was unclear, as few of the studies reported this and most of them had a serious risk of bias. Compared with the total life-time cost of US$55 640 for treating a person with HIV infection, the HIV prevalence among PWID has to be at least 0.8% (for pharmacy-based NSPs) or 2.1% (for other NSPs) to result in cost-savings. Conclusions: Pharmacy-based needle/syringe exchange programmes appear to be effective for reducing risk behaviours among people who inject drugs, although their effect on HIV/HCV prevalence and economic outcomes is unclear. ? 2016 Society for the Study of Addiction"

Data Sources and Study Eligibility Criteria: We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCRCT). Any study that compared the efficacy or safety between tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide in the adult PMN patients was included. Results: We included four randomized controlled trials and two prospective cohort studies with 389 PMN patients. The pooled results using the Dersimonian and Laird method showed that renal remission rates at the longest follow-up periods were not significantly different between the tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide groups (overall remission, six trials, n?=?389, relative risk [RR] 0.994 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.768¡V1.286); complete remission, six trials, n?=?389, RR 1.256 [95% CI 0.733¡V2.150]). Further analyses found that tacrolimus was comparable with cyclophosphamide for inducing renal remission within 1?year but inferior to cyclophosphamide after 1-year follow-up. It should be noted that only two studies reported the outcomes after 1-year follow-up, which might be considered as weak evidence. The rates of relapse and the drop-outs due to adverse effects were not significantly different (relapse, six trials, n?=?389, RR 2.244 [95% CI 0.892¡V5.644]; drop-outs, six trials, n?=?389, RR 1.330 [95% CI 0.412¡V4.291]). However, the cyclophosphamide group had a significantly higher risk of leukopenia than the tacrolimus group (four trials, n?=?216, RR 0.203 [95% CI 0.045¡V0.916]), whereas the rates of tremor were significantly higher in the tacrolimus group than in the cyclophosphamide group (three trials, n?=?202, RR 8.939 [95% CI 1.694¡V47.173]). Limitations: The quality and short follow-up durations of the studies limited the reliability of our conclusions. Conclusions: Tacrolimus was comparable with cyclophosphamide for inducing renal remission of PMN patients within 1?year, but the long-term effects need to be investigated. The cyclophosphamide group had a significantly higher risk of leukopenia, whereas the tacrolimus group had significantly higher rates of tremor. These conclusions need to be further verified. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Prophylactic mesh placement may be effective in reducing the rate of PH at the stoma site. The aims of this systematic review were to summarize the evidence with regard to the safety and effectiveness in comparison with the standard procedure without mesh placement and to identify important risk constellations. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library with no language or date restrictions. Randomized (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled trials (nRCTs) were included. The main outcomes of interest were PH (primary outcome) rate and stoma-related complications (secondary outcomes) such as stenosis or fistula. Statistical analysis included meta-analyses of pooled data and subgroup analyses. Results: Eleven trials (eight RCTs; three nRCTs) with a total of 755 patients were included. PH rate varied from 0% to 59% in the intervention and from 20% to 94% in the control group. RCTs showed a significant reduction of PH rate in the mesh group (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.58, p = 0.034), whereas included nRCTs did not. No significant differences were observed in postoperative complication rates. Subgroup analyses showed superiority of non-absorbable meshes and sublay mesh positioning in open surgery. Conclusion: Prophylactic mesh placement is safe and reduces PH rate. A recommendation for prophylactic non-absorbable meshes in a sublay position can be made for patients undergoing open colorectal operations with end-ostomies. Further research endeavors should focus on patient-oriented outcomes, not only PH rate, with respect to tailored treatment in specific patient populations. ? 2017 Pianka et al.

Search keywords included HPV, screening, DNA testing, vaginal testing, self-collected specimen, self-collected sample, self-sampling, self-screening, preferences and acceptability. Review methods Studies eligible for analysis included those that had participants perform self-sampling, evaluated participant acceptance of or preference for self-sampled vaginal HPV DNA and reported data to calculate an effect size. There were no exclusion criteria for publication status or geographical location. Meta-analytic methods were used to quantitatively synthesise effect sizes across studies. Results The 37 studies included 18...516 female participants from 24 countries across five continents. Overall, there was a high level of acceptability of self-sampling among the participants. Participants reported preference for self-sampling over clinician sampling due to attractive characteristics such as ease and privacy. Conclusions The overall acceptability of self-sampled cervical screening, coupled with economic and effective care, provides opportunities for expanding screening services. Importantly, this can provide a creative screening alternative for women who do not participate in traditional cytological screening, and may ultimately reduce health disparities and prevent cervical disease. ?

All randomized controlled trials and all cohort studies in which patients were randomized to receive either adrenergic alpha-antagonists or placebo for ureteral stones were identified. The outcome measures assessed were overall stone expulsion rate (primary), expulsion time (secondary), and treatment-emergent adverse events. Results Five trials with a total of 406 pediatric patients met the inclusion criteria. According to the doses of adrenergic alpha-antagonists, the pooling effects of adrenergic alpha-antagonists were analyzed, with a higher expulsion rate obtained than in controls, the stone expulsion rate (OR?=?2.70, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.91, P?=?0.001). Adrenergic alpha-antagonists statistically did not significantly decrease the number of the stone expulsion time with the placebo, the stone expulsion time (SMD?=???4.65, 95% CI ??9.76 to 0.45, P?=?0.07).

We therefore performed meta-analyses to investigate whether IORT was associated with more favorable oncologic outcomes when compared to non-IORT for patients who have gastric or esophageal cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed, Embase, and the references of relevant studies were systematically searched up to March 2016. Outcomes were analyzed with fixed-effect or random-effect models, and the meta-analysis was completed with odds ratio (OR), hazards ratio (HR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) as effect values. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Eleven studies were included, nine for gastric cancer and two for esophageal cancer. The studies included 1581 patients, 570 in the IORT group and 1011 in the control group. There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the IORT group and control group (HR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.73-1.13; P=0.38). Two subgroups based on cancer type also had the similar results (gastric group: HR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.78-1.24, P=0.87; esophagus group: HR=0.63, 95% CI: 0.37-1.05, P=0.08). Besides, lORT showed favorable effects for patients with cancer in stage II and stage III and had the advantage of loco-regional control. Regarding the complications, the occurrence rate had no significant difference between the IORT group and control group (OR=1.15;95% CI: 0.77-1.72; P=0.50). CONCLUSIONS: According to our meta-analysis, IORT did not extend the OS in gastric cancer and esophageal cancer patients, but had a favorable effect for specific stage patients to show loco-regional control, and did not increase the risk of complications. ? 2016 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA."

Using the GRADE criteria, we characterized the quality of evidence presented in this meta-analysis as moderate to high level. The current meta-analysis provided evidence that CoQ10 was safe and well tolerated in participants with PD and no superior to placebo in terms of motor symptoms. According to these results, we cannot recommend CoQ10 for the routine treatment of PD right now. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Italia."

CNIs had significant merits in increasing total remission (CSA vs CTX: OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.09 to 3.34, P?=?0.02; TAC vs CTX: OR 2.95, 95%CI 1.84 to 4.75, P?<?0.00001), elevating serum albumin (CSA vs CTX: MD 3.83, 95%CI 2.49 to 5.16, P?<?0.00001; TAC vs CTX: OR 8.57, 95%CI 5.08 to 12.07, P?<?0.00001) and reducing proteinuria (CSA vs CTX: MD ??0.73, 95%CI ??1.25 to ??0.22, P?=?0.005; TAC vs CTX: MD ??1.7, 95%CI ??2.29 to ??1.10, P?<?0.00001) compared with CTX after 6?months of treatment. However, no similar results were found after 12?months. Moreover, CSA had a higher relapse rate than CTX (OR 3.89, 95%CI 1.53 to 9.92, P?=?0.004), which was not found in the comparison of TAC and CTX. The incidences of leukopenia, alopecia and liver damage were higher in the CTX group (OR (95%CI): 0.23 (0.09 to 0.59), 0.10 (0.04 to 0.24), and 0.36 (0.19 to 0.69, respectively), whereas the incidences of hirsutism, gingival hyperplasia, worsening hypertension and hyperuricemia were higher in the CSA group (OR (95%CI): 8.64 (1.97 to 37.79, 4.44 (1.09 to 17.99), 4.59 (1.43 to 14.82) and 9.05 (1.53 to 53.36), respectively). Conclusions Our systematic review demonstrates that CNIs are promising alternatives to CTX for IMN patients, primarily due to their better short-term efficacy and safety. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of CNIs and CTX. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V."

This paper summarises the available evidence on seroprevalence of Ebola, Sudan and Bundibugyo virus IgG in people without known ebolavirus disease. Through systematic review, we identified 51 studies with seroprevalence results in sera collected from 1961 to 2016. We tabulated findings by study population, contact, assay, antigen and positivity threshold used, and present seroprevalence point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. We classified sampled populations in three groups: those with household or known case-contact; those living in outbreak or epidemic areas but without reported case-contact; and those living in areas with no recorded cases of ebolavirus disease. We performed meta-analysis only in the known case-contact group since this is the only group with comparable exposures between studies. Eight contact studies fitted our inclusion criteria, giving an overall estimate of seroprevalence in contacts with no reported symptoms of 3.3% (95% CI 2.4-4.4, P<0.001), but with substantial heterogeneity. ?

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is considered as a risk factor of EC. However, the association of p53 codon 72 polymorphism with the risk of HPV-related EC remains inconsistent. Hence, we aimed to investigate the association between p53 codon 72 polymorphism and HPV-related EC risk through meta-analysis. Methods: All eligible studies published before November 1, 2015 were selected by searching PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang with the following key words: ¡§p53¡¨, ¡§HPV¡¨ or ¡§human papillomavirus¡¨, and ¡§esophageal cancer¡¨. Crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the association. Statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.2 and Stata/SE 12.0. Results: Twelve studies including 1682 HPV-related EC cases were included in this meta-analysis. p53 codon 72 genotypes were associated with HPV-related EC in an allelic model (Arg vs. Pro: OR=1.66, 95% CI=1.19-2.32, P=0.003), a homozygous model (ArgArg vs. ProPro: OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.26-2.37, P=0.0007), and a recessive model (ArgArg vs. ArgPro+ProPro: OR=2.39, 95% CI=1.45-3.94, P=0.0006). By contrast, significant association was not seen in a heterozygous model (ArgPro vs. ProPro: OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.61-1.19, P=0.33) and a dominant model (ArgArg+ArgPro vs. ProPro: OR=1.24, 95% CI=0.93-1.65, P=0.14). A greater association was observed in the subgroup of studies performing PCR-RFLP or real-time PCR for p53 genotyping and studies performing PCR to detect HPV status in allelic and recessive models. Conclusion: p53 codon 72 Arg homozygous genotype is a high risk factor of HPV-related EC.

While school-aged children are the principal target group of preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel, limited information on efficacy and safety exists for preschool-aged children. Methods: Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials of praziquantel for treating children with any form of schistosomiasis. Efficacy was reported as cure rate (CR) and egg reduction rates (ERR); statistical corrections were applied based on methodological disparities across trials to derive the predicted geometrical mean ERR (pERRgm). Safety was reported as frequencies of adverse events. Results: Forty-seven comparative and non-comparative studies were identified, enrolling 15,549 children of whom 14,340 (92%) were assessed between 3 and 8 weeks post-treatment with praziquantel 40 mg/kg (the WHO-recommended treatment, n = 8,380, 56%) or comparators (n = 5,960, 44%). The median age was 10 years (range 1-19), 11% (n = 1,694) were preschool-aged. The CR and pERRgm with praziquantel 40 mg/kg were respectively: S. haematobium, 73.6% (95% CI: 63.5-81.40, 25 study arms) and 94.7% (95% CI: 92.7-96.4); S. mansoni, 76.4% (95% CI: 71.5-81.0, 34 arms) and 95.3% (95% CI: 94.2-96.2); S. mansoni/S. haematobium, 67.6% (95% CI: 54.1-80.7, 5 arms) and 93.4% (95% CI: 89.9-96.2); S. japonicum, 94.7% (95% CI: 92.2-98.0) and 98.7% (95% CI: 98.3-99.2). Mixed-effect multivariate analysis found no significant difference between preschool- and school-aged children for CR or pERRgm in S. haematobium (P = 0.309 and P = 0.490, respectively) or S. mansoni (P = 0.982 and P = 0.895) after controlling for time of assessment, formulation, intensity of infection and detection method. Praziquantel was reportedly safe at all ages, with only mild reported adverse events which cleared rapidly after treatment. Conclusions: Praziquantel 40 mg/kg was effective at reducing infection intensity in all Schistosoma species without differences between preschool- and school-aged children. However, conclusions should be tempered because of the limited number of preschool-aged children enrolled, disparities in study procedures and limited information made available in publications, as well as the current imperfect test-of-cure. Also, although reportedly well-tolerated, safety was inconsistently assessed. Studies in target groups, individual-data meta-analysis and standardised methodologies are needed for more robust evidence-base. ? 2017 The Author(s)."

As a consequence, WHO recommendations prioritize pregnant women over other risk groups for influenza vaccination. However, the risk associated with pregnancy has not been systematically quantified. Purpose Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that reported on pregnancy as a risk factor for severe outcomes from influenza virus infection. Data source MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL up to April 2014. Data selection Studies reporting on outcomes in pregnant women with influenza in comparison to non-pregnant patients with influenza. Outcomes included community-acquired pneumonia, hospitalization, admission to intensive care units (ICU), ventilatory support, and death. Data extraction Two reviewers conducted independent screening and data extraction. A random effects model was used to obtain risk estimates. Ecological studies were summarized descriptively. Data synthesis A total of 142 non-ecological and 10 ecological studies were included. The majority of studies (n?=?136, 95.8%) were conducted during the 2009 influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic. There was a higher risk for hospitalization in pregnant versus non-pregnant patients infected with influenza (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.22¡V4.87), but no significant difference in mortality (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.81¡V1.33) or other outcomes. Ecologic studies confirmed the association between hospitalization risk and pregnancy and 4 of 7 studies reported higher mortality rates in pregnant women. Limitations No studies were identified in which follow-up began prior to contact with the healthcare system and lack of adjustment for confounding factors. Conclusions We found that influenza during pregnancy resulted in a higher risk of hospital admission than influenza infection in non-pregnant individuals, but that the risk of mortality following influenza was similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant individuals. ? 2016 The Authors"

Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of genotyping for HPV types 16 and 18 and its utility as a second triage step after hrHPV testing in women with minor cervical lesions. Data Sources: Searches of 4 bibliographic databases, without language restrictions, from 1 January 1999 to 1 February 2016. Study Selection: Studies involving women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) who were triaged with tests for hrHPV and HPV 16/18 to find cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grade ?2 [CIN2+] or grade ?3 [CIN3+]). Data Extraction: Independent study selection, extraction of data, and quality assessment by 2 reviewers. Data Synthesis: Twenty-four moderate- to good-quality studies involving 8587 women with ASC-US and 5284 with LSIL were found. The pooled sensitivity of HPV 16/18 genotyping for CIN3+ was about 70% for women with either ASC-US or LSIL. The pooled specificity (with a threshold of grade <2 CIN) was 83% (95% CI, 80% to 86%) for women with ASC-US and 76% (CI, 74% to 79%) for those with LSIL. The average risk for CIN3+ was 17% and 19% in HPV 16/18-positive women with ASC-US and LSIL, respectively, and was 5% in hrHPV-positive but HPV 16/18- negative women with either ASC-US or LSIL. Limitation: Methodological and technical heterogeneity among studies; insufficient data to assess accuracy of separate assays. Conclusion: Testing for HPV 16/18 to triage women with minor abnormal cytology is poorly sensitive but may be useful as a second triage test after hrHPV testing, with direct referral if the woman is positive for HPV 16/18. Whether colposcopy or repeated testing is recommended for hrHPV-positive but HPV 16/18-negative women depends on local decision thresholds that can be derived from pretest-posttest probability plots. ? 2017 American College of Physicians."

Its added diagnostic value beyond signs and symptoms, however, remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of individual patient data to quantify the added value of CRP measurement. METHODS: We included studies of the diagnostic accuracy of CRP in adult outpatients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection. We contacted authors of eligible studies for inclusion of data and for additional data as needed. The value of adding CRP measurement to a basic signs-and-symptoms prediction model was assessed. Outcome measures were improvement in discrimination between patients with and without pneumonia in primary care and improvement in risk classification, both within the individual studies and across studies. RESULTS: Authors of 8 eligible studies (n = 5308) provided their data sets. In all of the data sets, discrimination between patients with and without pneumonia improved after CRP measurement was added to the prediction model (extended model), with a mean improvement in the area under the curve of 0.075 (range 0.02-0.18). In a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, the proportion of patients without pneumonia correctly classified at low risk increased from 28% to 36% in the extended model, and the proportion with pneumonia correctly classified at high risk increased from 63% to 70%. The number of patients with pneumonia classified at low risk did not change (n = 4). Overall, the proportion of patients assigned to the intermediate-risk category decreased from 56% to 51%. INTERPRETATION: Adding CRP measurement to the diagnostic work-up for suspected pneumonia in primary care improved the discrimination and risk classification of patients. However, it still left a substantial group of patients classified at intermediate risk, in which clinical decision-making remains challenging. ? 2017 Joule Inc. or its licensors."

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2017,Journal of the International AIDS Society,10.7448/IAS.20.1.21162,28364565,"Background: HIV is transmitted more effectively during anal intercourse (AI) than vaginal intercourse (VI). However, patterns of heterosexual AI practice and its contribution to South Africa's generalized epidemic remain unclear. We aimed to determine how common and frequent heterosexual AI is in South Africa. Methods: We searched for studies reporting the proportion practising heterosexual AI (prevalence) and/or the number of AI and unprotected AI (UAI) acts (frequency) in South Africa from 1990 to 2015. Stratified random-effects meta-analysis by subgroups was used to produce pooled estimates and assess the influence of participant and study characteristics on AI prevalence. We also estimated the fraction of all sex acts which were AI or UAI and compared condom use during VI and AI. Results: Of 41 included studies, 31 reported on AI prevalence and 14 on frequency, over various recall periods. AI prevalence was high across different recall periods for sexually active general-risk populations (e.g. lifetime = 18.4% [95%CI:9.4-27.5%], three-month = 20.3% [6.1-34.7%]), but tended to be even higher in higher-risk populations such as STI patients and female sex workers (e.g. lifetime = 23.2% [0.0-47.4%], recall period not stated = 40.1% [36.2-44.0%]). Prevalence was higher in studies using more confidential interview methods. Among general and higher-risk populations, 1.2-40.0% and 0.7-21.0% of all unprotected sex acts were UAI, respectively. AI acts were as likely to be condom protected as vaginal acts. Discussion: Reported heterosexual AI is common but variable among South Africans. Nationally and regionally representative sexual behaviour studies that use standardized recall periods and confidential interview methods, to aid comparison across studies and minimize reporting bias, are needed. Such data could be used to estimate the extent to which AI contributes to South Africa's HIV epidemic. ? 2017 Owen BN et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

Nine studies including a total of 1146 patients met the criteria (556 received multistrain probiotic bacteria, 590 with non-multistrain probiotic bacteria). The combination of multistrain probiotics was beneficial in the reduction of total infections (OR = 0.30, 95%CI: 0.15-0.61, p=0.0009), including surgical site infections (SSI) (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.25-0.89, p=0.02) and nonsurgical site infections (NSSI) (OR = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.23-0.56, p<0.00001).

In this meta-analysis, we assessed the overall risk of infection to MM patients treated with lenalidomide. Eleven phase II or III clinical trials, comprising 3,210 subjects, were selected from the Embase, Pubmed, and Cochrane Library databases, from the Clinical Trial Registration website, and from meeting abstracts and virtual presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Main outcome measures were overall incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of reported infection events. Fixed-effect or random-effect models were used in the statistical analyses, depending on the between-study heterogeneity. The overall incidence of high-grade infection was 14.32% (95% CI: 12.08%-16.90%) and high-grade infection's pooled RR was 2.23 (95% CI: 1.71-2.91, P < 0.0001) for all 11 studies evaluated. No evidence of publication bias for the incidence of high-grade infection was detected using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test (P = 0.2; 95% CI: -1.70, 1.23). From this meta-analysis, it appears lenalidomide use is associated with an increased risk of high-grade infection. Moreover, fatal infection events occurred only in patients treated with lenalidomide; no infection-related deaths were observed among controls. These data indicate that accurate diagnosis and optimal management of infection in MM patients treated with lenalidomide could be critical for treatment efficacy. ? Ying et al."

Although allogeneic blood transfusion has been identified as a risk factor for postoperative surgical-site infection following arthroplasty, results are inconclusive. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic meta-analysis to investigate whether having an allogeneic blood transfusion significantly increases the risk for surgical-site infection, particularly after total hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis using random-effect models.

Background: Evidence suggests that prevention strategies for HAIs should be multifaceted and transdisciplinary. ERAS and FTS protocols are collaborative approaches to perioperative care which reduce length of stay but may also be an effective strategy for reducing HAIs. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized trials involving either ERAS or FTS for abdominal or pelvic surgery. Primary outcome included postoperative incidence of 3 major HAIs: lung infection (LI), urinary tract infection (UTI), and surgical site infection (SSI). Results: Among all included trials, ERAS/FTS was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative LI [risk ratio (RR) = 0.38; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.61; P < 0.0001; I2 = 0%], UTI (RR = 0.42; 95% CI = 0.23-0.76; P=0.004; I2 =0%), and SSI (RR=0.75; 95% CI=0.58-0.98; P = 0.04; I2 = 0%) compared with conventional controls. Sensitivity analysis performed following the exclusion of high risk of bias publications did not appreciably affect these results. ERAS/FTS was also associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay (standard mean difference =-0.83; 95% CI=-0.92 to -0.75; P < 0.0001; P for heterogeneity <0.0001, I2 = 93%). Subgroup analysis of trials involving colorectal surgery and open incision also resulted in significant reduction in all 3 HAIs among ERAS/FTS compared with conventional counterparts. Conclusions: Our results suggest ERAS/FTS protocols are powerful tools to prevent HAIs. Further study is needed to establish the mechanism. Providers should consider adoption of similar transdisciplinary programs to reduce perioperative HAIs and at the same time improve the value of surgical care.

In absence of significant heterogeneity fixed-effects model (Mantel-Haenszel method) was used otherwise random effects (Der Simonian-Laird method) model was used. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the sources of heterogeneity (CRC subtype, geographic area, and study design type). 6 case-control studies, and 4 cross-sectional studies with a total of 16,857 participants and more than 3300 incident cases of CRC were included in our meta-analysis. In overall meta-analysis, pooled analysis of 10 observational studies imply that there is an increased risk of CRC in patients with history of H. pylori infection. But, pooling high quality studies showed that there was no significant association between H. pylori infection and risk of CRC. In subgroup analysis, association between H. pylori infection and CRC was observed only in cross-sectional studies but not in case-control studies. Both colon and rectal cancer did not show any significant association with H. pylori infection. Studies conducted in Asia showed a significant positive association of risk of CRC and H. pylori infection. Our meta-analysis suggests that there is no conclusive evidence to show the association between risk of CRC and H. pylori infection, and the heterogeneity present in the existing evidence which was neglected in many of the previous meta-analysis while deriving conclusions. ? 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Studies have shown that procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have very high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing serious bacterial infections (SBIs), with PCT performing better than CRP. Methods: Multiple databases were searched for relevant studies, and full-text articles involving diagnosis with PCT and CRP were reviewed. All meta-analyses were conducted with Review Manager 5.0. Sensitivity and bias analyses were performed to evaluate the quality of articles. In addition, a funnel plot and Egger test were used to assess possible publication bias. Result: A total of 17 articles met the criteria for inclusion. The concentrations of both PCT and CRP were higher in the SBI group than in the nonbacterial infection group. Sensitivity for differentiating bacterial infections from nonbacterial infections was higher for PCT compared with CRP, whereas there was no significant difference in specificity. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve for PCT was larger than that for CRP. Conclusion: Both PCT and CRP are useful markers and should be used to evaluate SBIs with fever of unknown origin. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Different studies carried out in Iran indicate this variation in this country. It is important to estimate the total infection prevalence using a reliable method such as meta- analysis in order to be applied by policymakers. This study aims to estimate the IgG and IgM seroprevalences of CMV infection among Iranian women and neonates. Method: We selected eligible articles for final meta- analysis by searching the national and international databases, excluding duplicates and irrelevant papers from primarily identified studies after abstract/full text review, implementing exclusion/inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Standard error of the prevalence was calculated according to binomial distribution formula. Based on the degree of heterogeneity, fixed or random effects models were applied for estimating the pooled prevalences. Results: In this study, 16 papers providing 20 evidences of CMV prevalence in Iran entered in the meta- analysis. CMV IgG and IgM seroprevalences as well as primary infection rate (95% confidence interval) among pregnant women were 92.8% (90.6 - 94.9), 6.4% (2.8 - 9.9) and 1.1% (0.7 - 1.5) respectively. CMV IgM seroprevalence among neonates were 0.6% (0.09 - 1.2), while CMV IgG and CMV IgM seroprevalences among non-pregnant women were 78.4% (70 - 86.8) and 4.6% (1.5 - 7.6) respectively. Conclusions: This meta- analysis showed that the prevalence of CMV infection among studied population is relatively high. Therefore, mortality, complications, anomalies and injuries among fetuses, neonates and immunocompromized patients can be partially related to the CMV infection. ? 2017, Iranian Journal of Cancer Prevention."

Antibiotic prophylaxis has potential of decreasing the risk of infections and mortality and improving poor functional outcome. Several studies evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis for infections in acute stroke patients have generated conflicting results. The systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) aimed at comprehensively assessing the evidence of antibiotic prophylaxis for the treatment of acute stroke patients. Materials and Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and the reference lists of eligible articles were searched to identify all potential studies. We included the studies that investigated the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis for the treatment of acute stroke patients. The primary outcome included mortality and infection rate. The secondary outcomes included poor functional outcome and adverse events. Results: Seven trials randomizing 4,261 patients were included. Pooled analyses showed that antibiotic prophylaxis did not improve the mortality (risk ratio (RR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.26, p = 0.78, I2 = 25%) and poor functional outcome (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.08, p = 0.32, I2=80%), but reduced the incidence of infection (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84, p = 0.0007, I2 = 49%). No major side effects were reported. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of infection rate and poor functional outcome.

We identified studies from 17 countries, reporting changes in the proportion of STH infection causing morbidity between baseline and follow-up. In the studies identified, the average proportion of individuals with STH infections of moderate and heavy intensity was of 14% at baseline and was on average reduced to 2% by the intervention (i.e., 85% reduction). There was an average reduction of 73% after the first year of treatment, which reached almost 80% after 5 years and over 95% in 10 years of deworming interventions. The reduction in hookworm prevalence was 57% after 12 months reaching 78% after 5 years.

There is insufficient evidence on the most effective management of the appendix stump. The aim of this study was to investigate the relative effectiveness and provide a treatment ranking of different options for securing the appendix stump. Methods Electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials comparing ligation methods of the appendix. The primary outcomes were organ/space infection and superficial operative site infection. We performed a network meta-analysis and estimated the pairwise relative treatment effects of the competing interventions using the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval. We obtained a hierarchy of the competing interventions using rankograms and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Results Forty-three randomized controlled trials were eligible and provided data for >5,000 patients.

Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) cause severe infections among patients with malignancy, and these infections are usually preceded by gastrointestinal colonization. Methods. We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases (up to May 26, 2016) to identify studies that reported data on VRE gastrointestinal colonization among patients with solid or hematologic malignancy. Results. Thirty-four studies, reporting data on 8391 patients with malignancy, were included in our analysis. The pooled prevalence of VRE colonization in this population was 20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 14%-26%). Among patients with hematologic malignancy, 24% (95% CI, 16%-34%) were colonized with VRE, whereas no studies reported data solely on patients with solid malignancy. Patients with acute leukemia were at higher risk for VRE colonization (risk ratio [RR] = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.17-3.26). Vancomycin use or hospitalization within 3 months were associated with increased colonization risk (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.06-3.45 and RR = 4.68, 95% CI = 1.66-13.21, respectively). Among the different geographic regions, VRE colonization rate was 21% in North America (95% CI, 13%-31%), 20% in Europe (95% CI, 9%-34%), 23% in Asia (95% CI, 13%-38%), and 4% in Oceania (95% CI, 2%-6%). More importantly, colonized patients were 24.15 (95% CI, 10.27-56.79) times more likely to develop a bloodstream infection due to VRE than noncolonized patients. Conclusions. A substantial VRE colonization burden exists among patients with malignancy, and colonization greatly increases the risk for subsequent VRE bloodstream infection. Adherence to antimicrobial stewardship is needed, and a re-evaluation of the use of vancomycin as empiric therapy in this patient population may be warranted. ? The Author 2016."

High heterogeneity hampered the unequivocal interpretation of results; however, combining the compared homogeneous groups in the meta-analysis (with adjustments for fixed and random effects) increased the statistical power of the investigation. In children aged 6 to 18 years, the OR for the positive effect of the drug (no new cases after its preventive administration) was 5.3 (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-5.9), heterogeneity test, ?2 = 249.5; p=0.000...; I2 = 94.8% (95% CI, 92.7-96.3%). This suggested the heterogeneity of clinical trial data and extrapolated this estimate to medical practice. The use of cycloferon in adults to treat acute respiratory viral infection enhanced their chances of enduring the disease in a mild form and avoiding serious complications: the OR for positive outcomes was 9.7 (95% CI, 7.0-13.0), while the effect was more homogeneous than in children (heterogeneity test, ?2 = 7.4; p=0.061...; I2 = 59.4% (95% CI, 0-86.5).

Strategies with ASP as a core component showed a statistically significant reduction the acquisition of ESBLproducing Enterobacteriaceae (RR, 0.28 [95% CI, .11-.69] for STD+ASP+ENV and 0.23 [95% CI, .07-.80] for STD+ASP+DCL). Conclusions. A 4-component strategy was the most effective intervention to prevent MDR-GNB acquisition. As some strategies were differential for certain bacteria, our study highlighted the need for further evaluation of the most effective prevention strategies. ? The Author 2017.

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a leading cause of child mortality and longer-term impairment. Infection can sensitize the newborn brain to injury; however, the role of group B streptococcal (GBS) disease has not been reviewed. This paper is the ninth in an 11-article series estimating the burden of GBS disease; here we aim to assess the proportion of GBS in NE cases. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data from investigator groups reporting GBS-associated NE. Meta-analyses estimated the proportion of GBS disease in NE and mortality risk. UK population-level data estimated the incidence of GBS-associated NE. Results. Four published and 25 unpublished datasets were identified from 13 countries (N = 10 436). The proportion of NE associated with GBS was 0.58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18%-.98%). Mortality was significantly increased in GBS-associated NE vs NE alone (risk ratio, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.47-2.91]). This equates to a UK incidence of GBS-associated NE of 0.019 per 1000 live births. Conclusions. The consistent increased proportion of GBS disease in NE and significant increased risk of mortality provides evidence that GBS infection contributes to NE. Increased information regarding this and other organisms is important to inform interventions, especially in low- A nd middle-resource contexts. ? 2017 The Author."

Serum procalcitonin, released in response to bacterial infections, but not viral infections, could possibly identify AECOPD requiring antibiotics. In this meta-analysis we assessed the clinical effectiveness of procalcitoninbased protocols to initiate or discontinue antibiotics in patients presenting with AECOPD. Based on a prospectively registered protocol, we reviewed the literature and selected randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing procalcitonin-based protocols to initiate or discontinue antibiotics versus standard care in AECOPD. We followed Cochrane and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) guidance to assess risk of bias, quality of evidence and to perform meta-analyses. We included eight trials evaluating 1062 patients with AECOPD. Procalcitonin-based protocols decreased antibiotic prescription (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% CI 0.43-0.73) and total antibiotic exposure (mean difference (MD) -3.83, 95% CI (-4.32--3.35)), without affecting clinical outcomes such as rate of treatment failure (RR 0.81, 0.62-1.06), length of hospitalisation (MD -0.76, -1.95-0.43), exacerbation recurrence rate (RR 0.96, 0.69-1.35) or mortality (RR 0.99, 0.58-1.69).

There are an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths each year, many of which are due to infections, especially in low-and middle-income contexts. This paper, the eighth in a series on the burden of group B streptococcal (GBS) disease, aims to estimate the percentage of stillbirths associated with GBS disease. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude, World Health Organization Library Information System, and Scopus) and sought unpublished data from investigator groups. Studies were included if they reported original data on stillbirths (predominantly.28 weeks'f gestation or.1000 g, with GBS isolated from a sterile site) as a percentage of total stillbirths. We did meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of the percentage of GBS-associated stillbirths, regionally and worldwide for recent datasets. Results. We included 14 studies from any period, 5 with recent data (after 2000). There were no data from Asia. We estimated that 1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2%) of all stillbirths in developed countries and 4% (95% CI, 2%.6%) in Africa were associated with GBS. Conclusions. GBS is likely an important cause of stillbirth, especially in Africa. However, data are limited in terms of geographic spread, with no data from Asia, and cases worldwide are probably underestimated due to incomplete case ascertainment. More data, using standardized, systematic methods, are critical, particularly from low-and middle-income contexts where the highest burden of stillbirths occurs. These data are essential to inform interventions, such as maternal GBS vaccination. ? 2017 The Author."

The secondary objective was the accuracy of POCUS in the paediatric population subgroup. Setting Prospective studies set in emergency departments. Participants Emergency department patients (adult and paediatric) presenting with SSTI and suspected abscess. Primary and secondary outcome measures This systematic review was conducted according to Cochrane Handbook guidelines, and the following databases were searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews (1946-2015). We included prospective cohort and case-control studies investigating ED patients with SSTI and abscess or cellulitis, a defined POCUS protocol, a clearly defined gold standard for abscess and a contingency table describing sensitivity and specificity. Two reviewers independently ascertained all potentially relevant citations for methodologic quality according to QUADAS-2 criteria. The primary outcome measure was the sensitivity and specificity of POCUS for abscess. A preplanned subgroup (secondary) analysis examined the effects in paediatric populations, and changes in management were explored post hoc. Results Of 3028 articles, 8 were identified meeting inclusion criteria; all were rated as good to excellent according to QUADAS-2 criteria. Combined test characteristics of POCUS on the ED diagnosis of abscess for patients with SSTI were as follows: sensitivity 96.2% (95% CI 91.1% to 98.4%), specificity 82.9% (95% CI 60.4% to 93.9%), positive likelihood ratio 5.63 (95% CI 2.2 to 14.6) and negative likelihood ratio 0.05 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.11).

Hepatitis B virus infection and chronic kidney disease are prevalent and remain a major public health problem worldwide. It remains unclear how infection with hepatitis B virus impacts on the development and progression of chronic kidney disease. Aim. To evaluate the effect of infection with HBV on the risk of chronic kidney disease in the general population. Material and methods. We conducted a systematic review of the published medical literature to determine if hepatitis B infection is associated with increased likelihood of chronic kidney disease. We used the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird to generate a summary estimate of the relative risk for chronic kidney disease (defined by reduced glomerular filtration rate and/or detectable proteinuria) with hepatitis B virus across the published studies. Meta-regression and stratified analysis were also conducted. Results. We identified 16 studies (n = 394,664 patients) and separate meta-analyses were performed according to the outcome. The subset of longitudinal studies addressing ESRD (n = 2; n = 91,656) gave a pooled aHR 3.87 (95% CI, 1.48; 6.25, P < 0.0001) among HBV-infected patients and no heterogeneity was recorded. In meta-regression, we noted the impact of male (P = 0.006) and duration of follow- up (P = 0.007) upon the adjusted hazard ratio of incidence of chronic kidney disease (including end-stage renal disease). No relationship occurred between HBV positive status and prevalent chronic disease (n = 7, n = 109,889 unique patients); adjusted odds ratio, were 1.07 (95% CI, 0.89; 1.25) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76; 1.10), respectively. Conclusions. HBV infection is possibly associated with a risk of developing reduced glomerular filtration rate in the general population; no link between HBV sero-positive status and frequency of chronic kidney disease or proteinuria was noted in cross-sectional surveys. ? 2017, Fundacion Clinica Medica Sur.

Accordingly, we performed a network meta-analysis to compare four different target blood glucose levels (<110, 110¡V144, 144¡V180, and >180?mg/dL) in terms of the benefit and risk of insulin therapy. Methods: We included all of the studies from three systematic reviews and searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for other studies investigating glucose targets among critically ill patients. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were sepsis or bloodstream infection and the risk of hypoglycemia. Network meta-analysis to identify an optimal target glucose concentration. Results: The network meta-analysis included 18,098 patients from 35 studies. There were no significant differences in the risk of mortality and infection among the four blood glucose ranges overall or in subgroup analysis.

The prevalence (95% confidence intervals) of positive TST reactions in all groups, general population, health staff, medical students, household close contacts, patients with TB, immunocompromised patients, HIV/AIDS patients, and those with risky behaviors was 26.2% (19.6-32.8), 25.4% (4.8-46.1), 38.9% (27.4-50.9), 13.4% (9.9-16.7), 35.9% (16.4-55.5), 13.7% (8.4-18.9), 29.4% (21.2-37.7), and 14.6% (3.9-25.3), respectively. Our study showed great varieties of positive TST results among different Iranian subpopulations. Furthermore, the prevalence of latent TB infection among health professionals and family members of TB patients was considerably different from that of the other subgroup. Since TB control programs such as active case finding are routinely conducted among household close contacts and HIV/AIDS cases, other high?risk groups including health?care workers and immunocompromised patients should be taken into consideration in these preventive programs. ? 2017 International Journal of Preventive Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow."

Although there have been multiple studies published on norovirus epidemiology in Latin America, no comprehensive assessment of the role of norovirus has been conducted in the region. We aim to estimate the role of norovirus in the Latin American region through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing literature. Methods: We carried out a literature search in MEDLINE, SciELO and LILACS. We included papers that provided information on the prevalence or incidence of norovirus (including seroprevalence studies and outbreaks), with a recruitment and/or follow-up period of at least 12 months and where the diagnosis of norovirus was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The data were pooled for meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of norovirus AGE and norovirus asymptomatic infection with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Thirty-eight studies were included in the review. Overall, the prevalence of norovirus among AGE cases was 15% (95% CI: 13-18). By location, it was 15% in the community (95% CI: 11%-21%), 14% in outpatient settings (95% CI: 10%-19%) and 16% in hospital locations (95% CI: 12%-21%). The prevalence of norovirus among asymptomatic subjects was 8% (95% CI: 4-13). Norovirus GII.4 strains were associated with 37%-100% of norovirus AGE cases, but only 7% of norovirus asymptomatic detections.

This was a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of different antibiotic classes for prevention of surgical-site infection (SSI) after hernia repair. Methods: RCTs were identified that compared efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis on SSI after inguinal or femoral hernia repair from PubMed and Scopus databases up to March 2016. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Network meta-analysis was applied to assess treatment efficacy. The probability of being the best antibiotic prophylaxis was estimated using surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analysis. Results: Fifteen RCTs (5159 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were first-generation (7 RCTs, 1237 patients) and second-generation (2 RCTs, 532) cephalosporins, £]-lactam/£]-lactamase inhibitors (6 RCTs, 619) and fluoroquinolones (2 RCTs, 581), with placebo as the most common comparator (14 RCTs, 2190).

Between 2006 and 2015, HIV notifications increased among Aboriginal people; however, among non-Aboriginal people, notifications remained relatively stable. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to examine the prevalence of HIV among Aboriginal people overall and by subgroups. Methods: In November 2015, a search of PubMed and Web of Science, grey literature and abstracts from conferences was conducted. A study was included if it reported the number of Aboriginal people tested and those who tested positive for HIV. The following variables were extracted: gender; Aboriginal status; population group (men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, adults, youth in detention and pregnant females) and geographical location. An assessment of between study heterogeneity (I2 test) and within study bias (selection, measurement and sample size) was also conducted. Results: Seven studies were included; all were cross-sectional study designs. The overall sample size was 3772 and the prevalence of HIV was 0.1% (I2 = 38.3%, P = 0.136). Five studies included convenient samples of people attending Australian Needle and Syringe Program Centres, clinics, hospitals and a youth detention centre, increasing the potential of selection bias. Four studies had a sample size, thus decreasing the ability to report pooled estimates. Conclusions: The prevalence of HIV among Aboriginal people in Australia is low. Community-based programs that include both prevention messages for those at risk of infection and culturally appropriate clinical management and support for Aboriginal people living with HIV are needed to prevent HIV increasing among Aboriginal people. ? 2017 CSIRO."

Given that the majority of interventions produced low or very low quality of evidence, researchers should commit to rigorous evaluation and high quality reporting of HIV intervention studies. ? 2017 Jason Globerman et al. 2017."

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains a leading cause of neonatal sepsis in high-income contexts, despite declines due to intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). Recent evidence suggests higher incidence in Africa, where IAP is rare. We investigated the global incidence of infant invasive GBS disease and the associated serotypes, updating previous estimates. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data regarding invasive GBS disease in infants aged 0-89 days. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses of incidence, case fatality risk (CFR), and serotype prevalence. Results. We identified 135 studies with data on incidence (n = 90), CFR (n = 64), or serotype (n = 45). The pooled incidence of invasive GBS disease in infants was 0.49 per 1000 live births (95% confidence interval [CI],.43-.56), and was highest in Africa (1.12) and lowest in Asia (0.30). Early-onset disease incidence was 0.41 (95% CI,.36-.47); late-onset disease incidence was 0.26 (95% CI,.21-.30). CFR was 8.4% (95% CI, 6.6%-10.2%). Serotype III (61.5%) dominated, with 97% of cases caused by serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, and V. Conclusions. The incidence of infant GBS disease remains high in some regions, particularly Africa. We likely underestimated incidence in some contexts, due to limitations in case ascertainment and specimen collection and processing. Burden in Asia requires further investigation."

Intensive glucose control may involve a risk of hypoglycaemia, which in turn results in potentially severe complications. A systematic review was undertaken of studies comparing intensive versus conventional glucose control protocols in relation to reduction of SSI and other outcomes, including hypoglycaemia, mortality and stroke. Methods: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL and WHO databases from 1 January 1990 to 1 August 2015 were searched. Inclusion criteria were RCTs comparing intensive with conventional glucose control protocols, and reporting on the incidence of SSI. Meta-analyses were performed with a random-effects model, and meta-regression was subsequently undertaken. Targeted blood glucose levels, achieved blood glucose levels, and important adverse events were summarized. Results: Fifteen RCTs were included. The summary estimate showed a significant benefit for an intensive compared with a conventional glucose control protocol in reducing SSI (odds ratio (OR) 0¡P43, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P29 to 0¡P64; P < 0¡P001). A significantly higher risk of hypoglycaemic events was found for the intensive group compared with the conventional group (OR 5¡P55, 2¡P58 to 11¡P96), with no increased risk of death (OR 0¡P74, 0¡P45 to 1¡P23) or stroke (OR 1¡P37, 0¡P26 to 7¡P20). These results were consistent both in patients with and those without diabetes, and in studies with moderately strict and very strict glucose control. Conclusion: Stricter and lower blood glucose target levels of less than 150 mg/dl (8¡P3 mmol/l), using an intensive protocol in the perioperative period, reduce SSI with an inherent risk of hypoglycaemic events but without a significant increase in serious adverse events. ? 2016 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

A meta-analysis of feasibility, safety and efficacy were performed on eligible studies with RevMan 5.2 statistical software. Results: A literature search revealed a total of seven publications (2 prospective and 5 retrospective) that met criteria, reporting data from 999 patients. Patients were categorized into laparoscopic group with 212 patients and conventional open surgery group with 787 patients. Meta-analyses indicated significantly lower perioperative morbidity [OR=0.59, 95% CI (0.39, 0.90), P=0.001] and lesser wound related complications [OR=0.34, 95% CI (0.13, 0.91), P=0.03], as well as shorter hospitalization period [MD=-3.44, 95% CI (-4.85, -2.03), P<0.000001] in the laparoscopic group. With regard to mortality, biliary leakage, residual cavity infection or fluid collection, recurrence rate, both therapeutic methods showed no statistical significance.Conclusions: The laparoscopic approach is safe for selected patients. Clinical outcomes are comparable to open surgery; however, further randomized controlled trials are strongly needed to determine a universally accepted result, because the certainty of the evidence is very low. ? 2018, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Methods: An independent systematic review and meta-analysis of all published evidence from January 2005 to September 2016 comparing TCS with NCS was conducted. Surgical-site infection (SSI) was the primary outcome. The results of the meta-analysis were used in a decision-tree deterministic and stochastic cost model, using the National Health Service (NHS England)-based cost of inpatient admissions for infections and differential costs of TCS versus NCS. Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the final assessment from an initial 163 identified citations; 20 of 34 studies were randomized, and 17 of 34 reported blinding of physicians and assessors.

The incidence of C5 plasy, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), infection, axial pain, dysphagia, hoarseness, fusion failure, graft subsidence, graft dislodgment, and epidural hematoma is 5.3% (95% CI 4.3%-6.2%), 1.9% (95% CI 1.3%-2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI 1.7%-4.0%), 15.6% (95% CI 11.7%-19.5%), 16.8% (95% CI 13.6%-19.9%), 4.0% (95% CI 2.3%-5.7%), 2.6% (95% CI 0.2%-4.9%), 3.7% (95% CI 2.0%-5.5%), 3.4% (95% CI 2.0%-4.8%), 1.1% (95% CI 0.7%-1.5%), respectively. Patients with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) (6.3%) had a higher prevalence of C5 plasy than those with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) (4.1%), and a similar trend in CSF (12.2% vs 0.9%). Individuals after laminectomy and fusion (LF) had highest rate of C5 plasy (15.2%), while those who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) had the lowest prevalence (2.0%). Compared with patients after other surgical options, individuals after anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) have the highest rate of CSF (4.2%), infection (14.2%), and epidural hematoma (3.1%). Patients after ACDF (4.8%) had a higher prevalence of hoarseness than those with ACCF (3.0%), and a similar trend for dysphagia between anterior corpectomy combined with discectomy (ACCDF) and ACCF (16.8% vs 9.9%). Conclusions: Based on our meta-analysis, patients with OPLL have a higher incidence of C5 palsy and CSF. Patients after LF have a higher incidence of C5 palsy, ACCDF have a higher incidence of dysphagia, ACCF have a higher incidence of CSF and infection and ACDF have a higher incidence of hoarseness.

Previous reports on molecular rapid diagnostic testing (mRDT) do not consistently demonstrate improved clinical outcomes in bloodstream infections (BSIs). This meta-analysis seeks to evaluate the impact of mRDT in improving clinical outcomes in BSIs. Methods. We searched PubMed, CINAHL,Web of Science, and EMBASE through May 2016 for BSI studies comparing clinical outcomes between mRDT and conventional microbiology methods. Results. Thirty-one studies were included with 5920 patients. The mortality risk was significantly lower with mRDT than with conventional microbiology methods (odds ratio [OR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], .54-.80), yielding a number needed to treat of 20. The mortality risk was slightly lower with mRDT in studies with antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, .51-.79), and non-ASP studies failed to demonstrate a significant decrease in mortality risk (0.72; .46-1.12). Significant decreases in mortality risk were observed with both gram-positive (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, .55-.97) and gram-negative organisms (0.51; .33-.78) but not yeast (0.90; .49-1.67). Time to effective therapy decreased by a weighted mean difference of -5.03 hours (95% CI, -8.60 to -1.45 hours), and length of stay decreased by -2.48 days (-3.90 to -1.06 days). Conclusions. For BSIs, mRDT was associated with significant decreases in mortality risk in the presence of a ASP, but not in its absence. mRDT also decreased the time to effective therapy and the length of stay. mRDT should be considered as part of the standard of care in patients with BSIs."

This review examined the evidence from published data of comparative studies of laparoscopic versus open distal pancreatectomy of nonductal adenocarcinomatous pancreatic tumor in pancreatic body and tail. Methods: A systematic review of the studies comparing laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy was conducted. Comparative studies published between January 1996 and June 2016 were included. Studies were selected on the basis of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. These 2 techniques were compared regarding several outcomes of interest, which were divided into preoperative, operative, postoperative, and pathologic characteristics, postoperative biomarker, and hospital stay cost. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis partially confirmed the robustness of these data. Results: Ten comparative case-control studies involving 712 patients (53.7% laparoscopic and 46.3% open), who underwent a distal pancreatectomy were included. The results favored laparoscopy with regard to intraoperative blood loss (P=0.0001), the rate of blood transfusion (P=0.02), total hospital stay (P=0.004), postoperative hospital stay (P<0.0001), overall morbidity (P=0.0002), the rate of wound infection (P=0.05), time to initial feeds (P<0.0001), first flatus time (P=0.008), duration of pain-killer intake (P=0.0003), and C-reactive protein on postoperative day 1 (P=<0.0001). In the subgroup analysis, excluding western country studies, operation time changed to have a statistically significant difference between these 2 groups (P=0.02). Conclusions: Laparoscopic resection results in improved operative and postoperative outcomes compared with open surgery according to the results of the present meta-analysis. It may be a safe and feasible option for nonductal adenocarcinomatous pancreatic tumor patients in pancreatic body and tail.

Surgical site infection (SSI) following CS is a common cause of morbidity with reported rates of 3-15%. SSI represents a substantial burden to the health system including increased length of hospitalisation and costs of postdischarge care. The definition of SSI varies with the postoperative follow-up period among different health systems, resulting in differences in the reporting of SSI incidence. We propose to conduct the first systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the pooled estimate for the overall incidence of SSI following CS. Methods and analysis: We will perform a comprehensive search to identify all potentially relevant published studies on the incidence of SSI following CS reported from 1992 in the English language. Electronic databases including PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Scopus will be searched using a detailed search strategy. Following study selection, full-text paper retrieval, data extraction and synthesis, we will appraise study quality and risk of bias and assess heterogeneity. Incidence data will be combined where feasible in a meta-analysis using Stata software and fixed-effects or random-effects models as appropriate. This systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval is not required as this review will use published data. The review will evaluate the overall incidence of SSI following CS and will provide the first quantitative estimate of the magnitude of SSI. It will serve as a benchmark for future studies, identify research gaps and remaining challenges, and emphasise the need for appropriate prevention and control measures for SSI post-CS. A manuscript reporting the results of the systematic review and metaanalysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at scientific conferences."

Studies have suggested that group B Streptococcus (GBS) maternal rectovaginal colonization during pregnancy may be a risk factor for preterm delivery. This article is the fifth of 11 in a series. We aimed to assess the association between GBS maternal colonization and preterm birth in order to inform estimates of the burden of GBS. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data from investigator groups on the association of preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) and maternal GBS colonization (GBS isolation from vaginal, cervical, and/or rectal swabs; with separate subanalysis on GBS bacteriuria). We did meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of the risk and odds ratios (according to study design), with sensitivity analyses to investigate potential biases. Results. We identified 45 studies for inclusion. We estimated the risk ratio (RR) for preterm birth with maternal GBS colonization to be 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI],.99-1.48; P =.061) in cohort and cross-sectional studies, and the odds ratio to be 1.85 (95% CI, 1.24-2.77; P =.003) in case-control studies. Preterm birth was associated with GBS bacteriuria in cohort studies (RR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.45-2.69]; P <.001). Conclusions. From this review, there is evidence to suggest that preterm birth is associated with maternal GBS colonization, especially where there is evidence of ascending infection (bacteriuria). Several biases reduce the chance of detecting an effect. Equally, however, results, including evidence for the association, may be due to confounding, which is rarely addressed in studies. Assessment of any effect on preterm delivery should be included in future maternal GBS vaccine trials. ? 2017 The Author."

We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data on invasive GBS disease in women pregnant or within 42 days postpartum. We undertook meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of the incidence of maternal GBS disease. We examined maternal and perinatal outcomes and GBS serotypes. Results. Fifteen studies and 1 unpublished dataset were identified, all from United Nations-defined developed regions. From a single study with pregnancies as the denominator, the incidence of maternal GBS disease was 0.38 (95% confidence interval [CI],.28-.48) per 1000 pregnancies. From 3 studies reporting cases by the number of maternities (pregnancies resulting in live/still birth), the incidence was 0.23 (95% CI,.09-.37). Five studies reported serotypes, with Ia being the most common (31%). Most maternal GBS disease was detected at or after delivery. Conclusions. Incidence data on maternal GBS disease in developing regions are lacking. In developed regions the incidence is low, as are the sequelae for the mother, but the risk to the fetus and newborn is substantial. The timing of GBS disease suggests that a maternal vaccine given in the late second or early third trimester of pregnancy would prevent most maternal cases. ? 2017 The Author."

Level 1A evidence of effectiveness has been presented in various recent meta-analyses, yet well designed RCTs have not been able to reproduce these favourable results. The aim of this study was to evaluate all available evidence critically with comprehensive analysis to seek a more reliable answer regarding the effectiveness of TCS in the prevention of SSI. Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched from 1990 to November 2015 for RCTs that compared TCS with sutures that were exactly the same, but uncoated, in the prevention of SSI. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95 per cent confidence intervals were estimated using a random-effects model. Metaregression was used to substantiate subgroup effects, trial sequential analysis was employed to assess the risk of random error, and quality of evidence was determined using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Results: Twenty-one RCTs including 6462 patients were included. Risk of bias was serious. Pooled effects showed a RR of 0¡P72 (95 per cent c.i. 0¡P60 to 0¡P86; P < 0¡P001) for all publications. At a risk of 138 SSIs per 1000 procedures, the use of TCS reduced this by 39 (95 per cent c.i. 19, 55). Trial sequential analysis confirmed a RR reduction of 15 per cent for the use of TCS. Conclusion: GRADE assessment shows moderate-quality evidence that TCS are effective in reducing SSI.

An antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) is one of the core elements needed to optimize antimicrobial use. Although collaboration at the national level to address the importance of ASPs and antimicrobial resistance has occurred in the Asia Pacific region, hospital-level ASP implementation in this region has not been comprehensively evaluated. Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ASPs in inpatient settings in the Asia Pacific region from January 2005 through March 2016. The impact of ASPs on various outcomes, including patient clinical outcomes, antimicrobial prescription outcomes, microbiological outcomes, and expenditure were assessed. Results. Forty-six studies were included for a systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio for mortality from ASP before-after trials and 2-group comparative studies were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI], .88-1.19) and 0.69 (95% CI, .56-.86), respectively. The pooled effect size for change in overall antimicrobial and carbapenem consumption (% difference) was -9.74% (95% CI, -18.93% to -.99%) and -10.56% (95% CI, -19.99% to -3.03%), respectively. Trends toward decreases in the incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms and antimicrobial expenditure (range, 9.7%-58.1% reduction in cost in the intervention period/arm) were also observed. Conclusions. ASPs in inpatient settings in the Asia Pacific region appear to be safe and effective to reduce antimicrobial consumption and improve outcomes. However, given the significant variations in assessing the efficacy of ASPs, high-quality studies using standardized surveillance methodology for antimicrobial consumption and similar metrics for outcome measurement are needed to further promote antimicrobial stewardship in this region. ?

This review aimed to assess the best available evidence regarding risk factors for ART discontinuation in Ethiopia. Methods: Quantitative studies conducted in Ethiopia between 2002 and 2015 that evaluated factors associated with ART discontinuation were sought across six major databases. Only English language articles were included. This review considered studies that included the following outcome: ART treatment discontinuation, i.e. 'lost to follow up', 'defaulting' and 'stopping medication'. Meta-analysis was performed with Mantel Haenszel method using Revman-5 software. Summary statistics were expressed as pooled odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals at a p-value of &lt;0.05. Results: Nine (9) studies met the criteria of the search. Five (5) were retrospective studies, 3 were case control studies, and 1 was a prospective cohort study. The total sample size in the included studies was 62,156. Being rural dweller (OR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.5-2.7,I2 = 60%), being illiterate (OR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.1-2.1), being not married (OR = 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1-1.8), being alcohol drinker (OR = 2.9, 95%CI: 1.9-4.4,I2 = 39%), being tobacco smoker (OR = 2.6, 95%CI: 1.6-4.3,I2 = 74%), having mental illness (OR = 2.7, 95%CI: 1.6-4.6,I2 = 0%) and being bed ridden functional status (OR = 2.3, 95%CI: 1.5-3.4,I2 = 37%) were risk factors for ART discontinuation. Whereas, having HIV positive partner (OR = 0.4, 95%CI: 0.3-0.6, I2 = 69%) and being co-infected with Tb/HIV (OR = 0.6, 95%CI: 0.4-0.9, I2 = 0%) were protective factors. Conclusion: Demographic, behavioral and clinical factors influenced ART treatment discontinuation. Hence, we recommend strengthening decentralization of HIV care services in remote areas, strengthening of ART task shifting, application of seek-test-treat-succeed model, and integration of smoking cession strategies and mental health care into the routine HIV care program. ? 2017 Gesesew et al.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy-related events and adverse events of 2 different doses of everolimus in kidney transplant recipients. Materials and Methods. The Cochrane, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases were searched for randomized controlled trials published by the end of 2015 on the use of everolimus in kidney transplant recipients at doses of 1.5 mg/d and 3 mg/d. Two independent reviewers assessed the studies for quality and eligibility and extracted the data. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for treated efficacy-related events and adverse events were collected to calculate pooled measures. Results. A total of 8 articles describing 7 randomized controlled trials (n = 2148 participants) were included in this study. The overall RR in adverse event outcomes was significantly in favor of the lower dose of everolimus (RR, 0.96; 0.95% CI, 0.93 to 0.99; P &lt;.001). The overall risk of graft loss was lower with 1.5 mg/d of everolimus (RR, 0.76; 0.95% CI, 0.59 to 0.99; P =.04, I2 = 25.0%). There was no relationship between the rates of efficacy failure, biopsy-proven acute rejection, death, or loss to follow up outcomes in all the three follow-up times between the two doses of everolimus. Conclusions. The result of this systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the overall outcomes in adverse events and graft loss were better with everolimus, 1.5 mg/d, than with everolimus, 3 mg/d, when combined with other kidney transplantation medications. ? 2017, Iranian Society of Nephrology.

The study objective was to estimate the efficacy, radiographic benefits, safety and patient-reported outcomes of TNFi-methotrexate versus triple therapy in patients with RA. Methods: A systematic review and network metaanalysis (NMA) of randomised controlled trials of TNFi-methotrexate or triple therapy as one of the treatment arms in patients with an inadequate response to or who were naive to methotrexate was conducted. American College of Rheumatology 70% response criteria (ACR70) at 6 months was the prespecified primary endpoint to evaluate depth of response. Data from direct and indirect comparisons between TNFi-methotrexate and triple therapy were pooled and quantitatively analysed using fixed-effects and randomeffects Bayesian models. Results: We analysed 33 studies in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and 19 in patients naive to methotrexate. In inadequate responders, triple therapy was associated with lower odds of achieving ACR70 at 6 months compared with TNFi-methotrexate (OR 0.35, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.19 to 0.64). Most secondary endpoints tended to favour TNFi-methotrexate in terms of OR direction; however, no clear increased likelihood of achieving these endpoints was observed for either therapy. The odds of infection were lower with triple therapy than with TNFi -methotrexate (OR 0.08, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.57). There were no differences observed between the two regimens in patients naive to methotrexate. Conclusions: In this NMA, triple therapy was associated with 65% lower odds of achieving ACR70 at 6 months compared with TNFi-methotrexate in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate. Although secondary endpoints numerically favoured TNFi-methotrexate, no clear differences were observed. The odds of infection were greater with TNFi-methotrexate. No differences were observed for patients naive to methotrexate. These results may help inform care of patients who fail methotrexate first-line therapy. ?

There was a strong association between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and urogenital cancers, in particular the cervix. However, there is no clear causal relationship in all types of cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, the present study as a systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the prevalence and relation of HPV in GI cancers. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis study assess the prevalence of human papillomavirus in GI cancers in Iran. Data were collected by searching electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, SID and Iranmedex by English and Persian key words up to August 2016. Key words included: Human Papillomavirus, HPV, Cancer, Neoplasm, Carcinoma, Esophageal, colorectal, Gastrointestinal and Iran articles were entered in the EndNote software and duplicate papers were excluded. Data were extracted and analyzed by comprehensive meta-analysis software, Version 2 (CMA.V2) and random effects model. Results: Finally, we included 17 studies in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of HPV in Iranian patients with GI cancers was 16.4% (CI95%: 10.4-24.9). Considering all HPV types, the odds ratio of GI cancers in positive patients was 3.03 (CI95%: 1.42-6.45) while in patients with HPV-16 was 3.62 (CI: 1.43-4.82). Conclusion: The results show a strong relationship between HPV infection especially high-risk HPV type 16 and GI cancers in Iranian population."

Maternal rectovaginal colonization with group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the most common pathway for GBS disease in mother, fetus, and newborn. This article, the second in a series estimating the burden of GBS, aims to determine the prevalence and serotype distribution of GBS colonizing pregnant women worldwide. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus), organized Chinese language searches, and sought unpublished data from investigator groups. We applied broad inclusion criteria to maximize data inputs, particularly from low-and middle-income contexts, and then applied new meta-analyses to adjust for studies with less-sensitive sampling and laboratory techniques. We undertook meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of maternal GBS colonization prevalence at national and regional levels. Results. The dataset regarding colonization included 390 articles, 85 countries, and a total of 299 924 pregnant women. Our adjusted estimate for maternal GBS colonization worldwide was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-19%), with regional variation (11%-35%), and lower prevalence in Southern Asia (12.5% [95% CI, 10%-15%]) and Eastern Asia (11% [95% CI, 10%-12%]). Bacterial serotypes I-V account for 98% of identified colonizing GBS isolates worldwide. Serotype III, associated with invasive disease, accounts for 25% (95% CI, 23%-28%), but is less frequent in some South American and Asian countries. Serotypes VI-IX are more common in Asia. Conclusions. GBS colonizes pregnant women worldwide, but prevalence and serotype distribution vary, even after adjusting for laboratory methods. Lower GBS maternal colonization prevalence, with less serotype III, may help to explain lower GBS disease incidence in regions such as Asia. High prevalence worldwide, and more serotype data, are relevant to prevention efforts. ? 2017 The Author."

This meta-analysis was performed to determine the performance of pfHRP2 versus pLDH antigen RDTs in the detection of P. falciparum. Material and methods: After a systematic review of related studies, Meta- DiSc 1.4 software was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) analysis were used to summarize the overall test performance. Results: Fourteen studies which met the inclusion criteria were included in the meta-analysis. The summary performances for pfHRP2- and pLDH-based tests in the diagnosis of P. falciparum infections were as follows: pooled sensitivity, 96.3% (95.8-96.7%) vs. 82.6% (81.7-83.5%); specificity, 86.1% (85.3-86.8%) vs. 95.9% (95.4-96.3%); diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), 243.31 (97.679-606.08) vs. 230.59 (114.98-462.42); and area under ROCs, 0.9822 versus 0.9849 (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: The two RDTs performed satisfactorily for the diagnosis of P. falciparum, but the pLDH tests had higher specificity, whereas the pfHRP2 tests had better sensitivity. The pfHRP2 tests had slightly greater accuracy compared to the pLDH tests. A combination of both antigens might be a more reliable approach for the diagnosis of malaria.

Methods: A systematic literature search from January 1985 to July 2015 was performed in MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL. Only RCTs investigating immunonutrition in major abdominal surgery were included. Outcomes evaluated were mortality, overall complications, infectious complications and length of hospital stay. The influence of different domains of bias was evaluated in sensitivity analyses. Evidence was rated according to the GRADE Working Group grading of evidence. Results: A total of 83 RCTs with 7116 patients were included. Mortality was not altered by immunonutrition. Taking all trials into account, immunonutrition reduced overall complications (odds ratio (OR) 0¡P79, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P66 to 0¡P94; P = 0¡P01), infectious complications (OR 0¡P58, 0¡P51 to 0¡P66; P < 0¡P001) and shortened hospital stay (mean difference ¡V1¡P79 (95 per cent c.i. ¡V2¡P39 to ¡V1¡P19) days; P < 0¡P001) compared with control groups. However, these effects vanished after excluding trials at high and unclear risk of bias. Publication bias seemed to be present for infectious complications (P = 0¡P002). Non-industry-funded trials reported no positive effects for overall complications (OR 1¡P13, 0¡P88 to 1¡P46; P = 0¡P34), whereas those funded by industry reported large effects (OR 0¡P66, 0¡P48 to 0¡P91; P = 0¡P01). Conclusion: Immunonutrition after major abdominal surgery did not seem to alter mortality (GRADE: high quality of evidence).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to better explore the role of H. pylori eradication in preventing GC, with particular reference to patients with precancerous lesions at baseline histology. Methods Searches for human studies were performed through October 2016 and risk ratios (RRs), were obtained. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated using the Cochran Q test and I2 values, whereas the possibility of publication bias was estimated with funnel plots. Additionally, we performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results In 26 studies suitable for meta-analysis (10 randomized controlled trials and 16 cohort studies) 52,363 subjects were included. The risk of GC among patients in whom H. pylori was successfully eradicated was significantly lower than that among controls: pooled RRs [95% CI] 0.56 [0.48-0.66], Z= -7.27, P=0.00001. This finding applied separately for randomized controlled trials (0.65 [0.51-0.84], Z= -3.33, P=0.0009) and for cohort studies (0.51 [0.42-0.62], Z= -6.63, P=0.00001). Concerning H. pylori eradication in patients with precancerous lesions, subgroup analyses showed that patients with non-atrophic or atrophic gastritis benefited from H. pylori eradication for the risk of GC development, whereas those with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia did not. Conclusion H. pylori eradication is associated with a significantly lower risk of GC; this finding has significant implications for the prevention of this cancer. The benefit is maximized when H. pylori eradication is applied at early stages of the infection. ? 2017 Hellenic Society of Gastroenterology."

In order to increase the protection of the vaccines, a 9-valent vaccine (HPV9) was developed, which provides protection against nine types of the virus. Studies evaluating its safety are rare. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of three clinical trials assessing adverse effects on women randomly vaccinated with HPV9 or tetravalent vaccine (HPV4), with the objective of analyzing whether the HPV9 is as safe as HPV4. An electronic data search was performed through the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO databases. The studies selected 27,465 women who received one of the two vaccines. Pain (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.62-1.82) and erythema (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.21-1.36) occurred significantly more in the HPV9 group. However, there was no significant difference between the groups for the following adverse effects: headache (OR 1.07; 95% CI 0.99-1.15), dizziness (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.93-1.27), and fatigue (OR 1.09; 95% CI 0.91-1.30), and the occurrence of serious events related to vaccination was similarly rare among those vaccinated. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that HPV9 in female patients is as safe as the tetravalent vaccine. ? 2017 Ana Paula Ferreira Costa et al."

Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards, we performed a systematic review. Electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify randomised and non-randomised studies comparing postoperative outcomes associated with initial varus versus initial valgus displacement of proximal humerus fracture. The Newcastle¡VOttawa scale was used to assess the methodological quality and risk of bias of the selected studies. Fixed-effect or random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data. Results We identified two retrospective cohort studies and one retrospective analysis of a prospective database, enrolling a total of 243 patients with proximal humerus fractures. Our analysis showed that initial varus displacement was associated with a higher risk of overall complication (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.12¡V4.64, P?=?0.02), screw penetration (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.06¡V5.02, P?=?0.04), varus displacement (RR 4.38, 95% CI 2.22¡V8.65, P?<?0.0001), and reoperation (RR 3.01, 95% CI 1.80¡V5.03, P?<?0.0001) compared to valgus displacement.

Conclusions The best available evidence demonstrates that initial varus displacement of proximal humerus fractures is associated with higher risk of overall complication, screw penetration, varus displacement, and reoperation compared to initial valgus displacement. The best available evidence is not adequately robust to make definitive conclusions. Further high quality studies, that are adequately powered, are required to investigate the outcomes of initial varus and valgus displacement in specific fracture types.

We searched several databases from inception through 24 January 2017, to identify comparative studies evaluating the effect of rifaximin on the occurrence of SBP and HRS. We performed predetermined subgroup analyses based on the type of control group, design of the study, and type of prophylaxis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. We included 13 studies with 1703 patients in the meta-analysis of SBP prevention. Pooled OR [95% confidence interval (CI)] was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22-0.73) (I 2 =58%). On sensitivity analysis, adjusted OR was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.20-0.44) (I 2 =0%).

The objective of this study was to provide information about the global prevalence and distribution of non-AIDS causes of death in the last ten years among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, by income levels of countries. We used broad search terms in Google Scholar, PubMed, and EMBASE to identify all studies that investigated the cause of death among people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy, published after January 1, 2005.

Inclusion criteria were English language, the study¡¦s end date was after 2005, all patients were HIV-positive, at least two-thirds of the patients were receiving antiretroviral therapy, at least one patient died of non-AIDS causes of death. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed by at least two independent readers. Of 2951 titles identified in our original search, 151 articles were selected for further screening. We identified 19 studies meeting our full criteria, with patients from 55 different nations. Pooled non-AIDS causes of death prevalence estimates in high-income countries were 53.0% (95% confidence interval, 43.6¡V62.3), in developing countries 34.0% (95% confidence interval, 20.3¡V49.1), and in sub-Saharan countries 18.5% (95% confidence interval, 13.8¡V23.7). Statistically significant variation was noted within and between categories.

Agreement on articles for study inclusion was very high between the reviewers (kappa 0.86). In a meta-analysis, the overall pooled risk of failed medical management was 29.3% (95% CI 21.4%-37.2%) and when medical to surgical crossover was used to define failure the rate was 26.3% (95% CI 13.0%-39.7%). Only 6 studies provided data for analysis by intended treatment, with a pooled estimate of 35.1% (95% CI 15.7%-54.4%) of failed medical management. Two studies reported predictors of the failure of medical management. Concl usions Although the incidence of failed medical management of SEA was relatively common in published reports, estimates were highly heterogeneous between studies, thus introducing uncertainty about the frequency of this risk. A consensus definition of failure is required to facilitate comparison of failure rates across studies. ? AANS, 2017."

In fact, the contamination was usually being underestimated. Disinfection and probe cover in transvaginal ultrasound remained controversial. This study was planned with the objective to review the pooled proportion of contamination and types of microbes contaminated after the standard procedure at transvaginal probe and characterize the methods of disinfection and type of cover probe used in transvaginal ultrasound. Comprehensive literature search was done in Medline (1966-2015), SCOPUS (2004-2015), EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials along with reference lists of electronically retrieved studies. We considered all published English language articles. The author used search strategy with words such as transvaginal, ultrasound, probe, contamination, and infect. Full-text journals are more preferred, but the abstract only journal is considered based on if the data are provided in the abstract. Data of study design, contamination rate, ultrasound disinfection technique, and probe cover were being reviewed. The pooled proportion of microbes contamination and difference of disinfection and probe cover were determined using Stata 12 and Review Manager 5.4. From 110 studies, 13 studies were potentially eligible for systematic review. Pooled proportion of total microbes contamination was 31% (95% CI: 1-56%, I2: 99.14%, P = 0.00). This rate was found 50% in bacteria contamination and only 4% in virus contamination. The most prevalence bacteria were coagulase-negative Staphylococci. A similar contamination rate was found either using condom or specific cover as probe cover (both 3%, risk difference ?0.04). Interestingly, some studies showed advantage of using gloves as probe covers and automated disinfectant machine as disinfection methods. Contamination rate, especially bacteria contamination, is still high even after using the standard disinfection procedure. Further research is needed to find new disinfection procedures to reduce the contamination rate. ? 2016 Citra Aryanti."

Ledipasvir inhibits the HCV non-structural 5A protein, while sofosbuvir is a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Many studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir combination with and without ribavirin for patients with chronic HCV genotype-1. Methods: A computer literature search of PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane CENTRAL has been conducted. Studies were screened for eligibility and data were extracted. Sustained virological response (SVR) rate and commonly reported adverse events were pooled as risk ratio (RR) using Review Manager version 5.3 for windows and OpenMeta (Analyst) software. Results: Eight randomized controlled trials (n=1,892) were pooled in the final analysis. A 12-week ledipasvir and sofosbuvir regimen achieved SVR in 97.5% and 89% of non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients, respectively. A 24-week ledipasvir and sofosbuvir regimen achieved SVR in 99.6% and 92.6% in non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients, respectively. When ribavirin was added to the treatment regiment, the SVR did not differ significantly in either of the treatment regimens (12-week SVR: 93.9% versus 96.7%, RR=0.97, P=0.19 and 24-week SVR: 94.8% versus 97.2%, RR=0.98, P=0.24). Conclusions: The combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir achieved high SVR rates (>90%) in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients with HCV genotype-1. The addition of ribavirin to this regimen did not significantly increase the SVR rates. ? 2017 International Medical Press."

The aim of this study was to compare the safety profile of biologic drugs in patients with IBD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases, up to 22 August 2016. We included randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head clinical trials that compared the safety of different biologics in patients with IBDs. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and selection of studies and rated each trial¡¦s risk of bias. The network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted for a mid-term (20¡V30?weeks) and long-term (?52?weeks) follow-up with a Bayesian hierarchical random effects model using the ADDIS? software. The PROSPERO registration number was CRD42015029884. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review with NMA. In the case of the mid-term follow-up, it was possible to conduct the NMA for assessing the relative safety profile of certolizumab pegol and infliximab, and in the case of the long-term follow-up, of infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and vedolizumab. There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events in patients treated with all analyzed biologic drugs for IBD. The analysis of probability for being the safest treatment showed that infliximab was the best option in most analyzed endpoints both in mid-term and in long-term follow-ups. Conclusions: We showed no significant differences in the relative safety profile of the analyzed biologic drugs. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, including head-to-head comparisons between these drugs. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

This meta-analysis was designed to compare the effectiveness of two different limb positions in primary TKA. Materials and methods A meta-analysis of the PubMed, CENTRAL, Web of Science, EMBASE and Google Search Engine electronic databases was performed. In this meta-analysis, two postoperative limb positions were considered: mild-flexion (flexion less than 60¢X) and high-flexion (flexion at 60¢X or more). The subgroups were analysed using RevMan 5.3. Results Nine RCTs were included with a total sample size of 913 patients. The mild- and high-flexion positions significantly reduced postoperative total blood loss (P?=?0.04 and P?=?0.01; respectively). Subgroup analysis indicated that knee flexion significantly reduced hidden blood loss when the knee was fixed in mild-flexion (P?=?0.0004) and significantly reduced transfusion requirements (P?=?0.03) and improved range of motion (ROM) (P?<?0.00001) when the knee was fixed in high-flexion. However, the rates of wound-related infection, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) did not significantly differ between the two flexion groups. Conclusion This meta-analysis suggests that mild- and high-flexion positions have similar efficacy in reducing total blood loss. In addition, subgroup analysis indicates that the mild-flexion position is superior in decreasing hidden blood loss compared with high-flexion; the high-flexion position is superior to mild¡Vflexion in reducing transfusion requirements and improving postoperative ROM. Thus, the use of the high-flexion position is a viable option to reduce blood loss in patients following primary TKA without increasing the risk of wound-related infection, DVT or PE. ? 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

These delays in treatment initiation are particularly impactful because of significant HIV-related infant mortality observed by 2-3 months of age. Short message service (SMS) and general packet radio service (GPRS) printers allow test results to be transmitted immediately to health care facilities on completion of testing in the laboratory. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the benefit of using SMS/GPRS printers to increase the efficiency of EID test result delivery compared with traditional courier paper-based results delivery methods. Results: We identified 11 studies contributing data for over 16,000 patients from East and Southern Africa. The test turnaround time from specimen collection to result received at the health care facility with courier paper-based methods was 68.0 days (n = 6835), whereas the test turnaround time with SMS/GPRS printers was 51.1 days (n = 6711), resulting in a 2.5-week (25%) reduction in the turnaround time. Conclusions: Courier paper-based EID test result delivery methods are estimated to add 2.5 weeks to EID test turnaround times in low resource settings and increase the risk that infants receive test results during or after the early peak of infant mortality. SMS/GPRS result delivery to health care facility printers significantly reduced test turnaround time and may reduce this risk. SMS/GPRS printers should be considered for expedited delivery of EID and other centralized laboratory test results. ? Copyright 2017 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

We undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the relationship between delivered protein and mortality in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nutritional interventions involving critically ill adults. Secondary outcomes included the effect of protein dose on lengths of stay, mechanical ventilation and incidence of infections. Methods: We reviewed the relevant English-language literature published between 1966 and 2015 and identified RCTs comparing different strategies of nutritional support lasting at least 48 hours in critically ill adults. Articles were included if mortality was reported and the difference in delivered protein between interventions was significant (P &lt; 0.05). We calculated summary estimates for mortality as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects estimator, and we used meta-regression to assess the effect of delivered protein on mortality. Results: From 3016 assessed records, 357 full-text articles were reviewed and 14 studies, investigating various interventions and routes of nutrition and comprising 3238 patients, were included. The mean protein delivered was 42.95 g/day (SD, 20.45 g/day) or 0.67 g//kg/day (SD, 0.38 g/kg/day) in patients receiving less protein, and 67.15 g/day (SD, 28.47 g/day) or 1.02 g/kg/day (SD, 0.42 g/kg/day) in the higher protein group. Provision of less protein did not influence mortality risk (pooled OR, 0.935; 95% CI, 0.716 ¡V1.219; P = 0.618; I2 = 48.2%). Meta-regression analysis did not show a relationship between mean daily protein delivered and mortality (P = 0.433; I2 = 50.18%). There were no differences between groups in any secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Delivery of varying amounts of nutritional protein was not associated with any effect on mortality. ? 2017, Australasian Medical Publishing co. All rights reserved."

Methods of Study Selection: We conducted an electronic search of research articles from 1966 to January 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort, and retrospective cohort studies of negative pressure wound therapy compared with standard dressing after cesarean delivery among obese women. Our primary outcome was defined as a composite of wound complication, including wound or surgical site infection, cellulitis, seroma, hematoma, wound disruption, or dehiscence. For cohort studies and RCTs, we performed a descriptive systematic review. For available RCTs, we performed a meta-analysis and pooled risk ratios using a random-effects model.We assessed for heterogeneity using £q2 test for heterogeneity and I2 test. We assessed for publication bias using a funnel plot. Tabulation, Integration, and Results: Of 10 studies meeting eligibility criteria, five were RCTs and five were cohort studies. Results of cohort studies were varied; however, all had a high potential for selection bias. In the meta-analysis, there was no difference in primary composite outcome among those women with negative pressure wound therapy (16.8%) compared with those who had standard dressing (17.8%) (risk ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.63-1.49). There was no statistically significant heterogeneity (£q2 test 4.80, P=.31, I2=17%).

However, there is clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis were performed by third drug and by level of viral load prior to treatment, and found no differences in virological control. Network meta-analysis could only be carried out with TDF/FTC vs. ZDV/3TC, and the proportion of patients with virological response, with no differences at 48 weeks nor at 96 weeks. Direct comparisons showed an increased risk of bone marrow suppression of ZDV/3TC vs. TDF/FTC and of ABC/3TC hypersensitivity reactions vs. ZDV/3TC Conclusions: The results did not show differences in effectiveness among the interventions.

This is the 10th of 11 articles estimating the burden of GBS disease. Here we aimed to estimate NDi in survivors of infant GBS disease. Methods. We conducted systematic literature reviews (PubMed/Medline, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature [LILACS], World Health Organization Library Information System [WHOLIS], and Scopus) and sought unpublished data on the risk of NDi after invasive GBS disease in infants <90 days of age. We did meta-analyses to derive pooled estimates of the percentage of infants with NDi following GBS meningitis. Results. We identified 6127 studies, of which 18 met eligibility criteria, all from middle-or high-income contexts. All 18 studies followed up survivors of GBS meningitis; only 5 of these studies also followed up survivors of GBS sepsis and were too few to pool in a meta-analysis. Of meningitis survivors, 32% (95% CI, 25%-38%) had NDi at 18 months of follow-up, including 18% (95% CI, 13%-22%) with moderate to severe NDi. Conclusions. GBS meningitis is an important risk factor for moderate to severe NDi, affecting around 1 in 5 survivors. However, data are limited, and we were unable to estimate NDi after GBS sepsis. Comparability of studies is difficult due to methodological differences including variability in timing of clinical reviews and assessment tools. Follow-up of clinical cases and standardization of methods are essential to fully quantify the total burden of NDi associated with GBS disease, and inform program priorities. ? 2017 The Author."

This review assessed awareness and willingness to use oral PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM) in LMIC. Methods: Electronic literature search of Cochrane library, Embase, PubMed, PsychINFO, CINHAL, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was conducted between July and September 2016. Reference lists of relevant studies were searched, and three authors contacted for additional data. Non-peer reviewed publications were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion, and relevant data abstracted, assessed for bias, and synthesized. Results: In total, 2186 records were identified, of which 23 studies involving 14,040 MSM from LMIC were included. The proportion of MSM who were aware of PrEP was low at 29.7% (95% CI: 16.9-44.3). However, the proportion willing to use PrEP was higher, at 64.4% (95% CI: 53.3-74.8). Proportions of MSM aware of PrEP was <50% in 11 studies and 50-70% in 3 studies, while willingness to use PrEP was <50% in 6 studies, 50-70% in 9 studies, and over 80% in 5 studies. Several factors affected willingness to use PrEP. At the individual domain, poor knowledge of PrEP, doubts about its effectiveness, fear of side effects, low perception of HIV risk, and the need to adhere or take medicines frequently reduced willingness to use PrEP, while PrEP education and motivation to maintain good health were facilitators of potential use. Demographic factors (education, age, and migration) influenced both awareness and willingness to use PrEP, but their effects were not consistent across studies. At the social domain, anticipated stigma from peers, partners, and family members related to sexual orientation, PrEP, or HIV status were barriers to potential use of PrEP, while partner, peer, and family support were facilitators of potential use. At the structural domain, concerns regarding attitudes of healthcare providers, quality assurance, data protection, and cost were determinants of potential use. Conclusions: This review found that despite low levels of awareness of PrEP, MSM in LMIC are willing to use it if they are supported appropriately to deal with a range of individual, social, and structural barriers. ? 2017 Yi S et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

The network meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences for the 4-week healing rate of duodenal ulcer treated with different PPI regimens except pantoprazle 40 mg/d versus lansoprazole 15 mg/d [Relative risk (RR) = 3.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.36-10.31)] and lansoprazole 30 mg/d versus lansoprazole 15 mg/d (RR = 2.45; 95% CI = 1.01-6.14). In comparison with H2receptor antagonists (H2RA), pantoprazole 40 mg/d and lansoprazole 30 mg/d significantly increase the healing rate (RR = 2.96; 95% CI = 1.78-5.14 and RR = 2.04; 95% CI = 1.13-3.53, respectively). There was no significant difference for the rate of adverse events between different regimens, including H2RA for a duration of 4-week of follow up. Conclusion: There was no significant difference for the efficacy and tolerance between the ordinary doses of different PPIs with the exception of lansoprazle 15 mg/d."

Given the great impact of IRPA on patients¡¦ outcome and in order to possibly improve antibiotic prescription, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of clinical isolates of IRPA in different parts of Iran. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus, as well as in two Iranian domestic search engines, i.e., Iranian Scientific Information Database and Magiran. Finally, after applying exclusion and inclusion criteria 37 articles with full-texts describing the prevalence of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa were selected for meta-analysis and systematic review. Results The pooled estimation of 5227 P. aeruginosa isolates in this analysis showed that the percentage of imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa is about 54% in the Iranian population (95%CI: 0.47-0.62, logit event rate=0.19, 95%CI: -0.12,0.49). Conclusion The findings of this analysis show that in the majority of Iranian hospitals the relative frequency of IRPA is high, therefore, in order to prevent further dissemination of IRPA, more appropriate antibiotic prescription and infection control policies must be implemented by decision-makers. ?

Methods. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, EMBASE, Ovid, EBSCO, and Web of Science databases (from 1998 to May 2016) to select RCTs, which compared the efficacy of PPIs BID versus QD for GERD. The primary outcomes were symptom relief or esophageal mucosal healing at weeks 4 and 8. The M-H method with fixed-effect or random-effect model was used to calculate RR and 95% CIs. Results. Seven RCTs were enrolled. The esophageal healing rates were higher in PPIs BID group (P=0.01), and rabeprazole 20 mg BID can achieve better mucosal healing than 20 mg QD after 8 weeks (P<0.05). However, no significant differences were observed in heartburn relief (P=0.27), sustained symptom relief rates at week 4 (P=0.05), 24 h pH monitoring after treatment (P=0.11), endoscopic response at week 4 (P=0.22), and adverse events (P=0.18). Conclusion. PPIs BID more effectively improve endoscopic healing rate at week 8 than PPIs QD.

Absorbable meshes used in inguinal hernia repair are believed to result in less chronic pain than permanent meshes, but concerns remain whether absorbable meshes result in an increased risk of recurrence. The aim of this study was to present an overview of the advantages and limitations of fully absorbable meshes for the repair of inguinal hernias, focusing mainly on postoperative pain and recurrence. Methods. This systematic review with meta-analyses is based on searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Psychinfo. Included study designs were case series, cohort studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and non-RCTs. Studies had to include adult patients undergoing an inguinal hernia repair with a fully absorbable mesh. Results. The meta-analyses showed no difference in recurrence rates (median 18 months follow-up) and chronic pain rates (1 year follow-up) between absorbable- and permanent meshes. Crude chronic pain rates for the RCTs were 2.1% for the absorbable meshes and 7.6% for the permanent meshes. For the absorbable meshes, medial hernias were more susceptible for recurrence compared with lateral hernias (P <.0005). None of the studies reported allergic reactions or other serious adverse events related to the absorbable mesh. Conclusions. Patients with an absorbable mesh seem to have less chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery compared with permanent meshes, without increased risk of recurrence. ? The Author(s) 2017."

Emergency resection represents the traditional treatment for left-sided malignant obstruction. However, the placement of self-expanding metallic stents and delayed surgery has been proposed as an alternative approach. The aim of the current meta-analysis was to review the available evidence, with particular interest for the short-term outcomes, including a recent multicentre RCT. Methods. We considered randomized controlled trials comparing stenting as a bridge to surgery and emergency surgery for the management of left-sided malignant large bowel obstruction, performing a systematic review in MEDLINE, PubMed database, and the Cochrane libraries. Results. We initially identified a total of 2543 studies. After the elimination of duplicates and the screening of titles and abstracts, seven studies, for a total of 448 patients, were considered. The current meta-analysis revealed no difference in the mortality rate between the stent group and the emergency surgery group; the postoperative complication rate (37.84% versus 54.87%, P=0.02), the stoma rate (28.8% versus 46.02%, P<0.0001), and the incidence of wound infection (8.11% versus 15.49%, P=0.01) were reduced after stent as a bridge to surgery. Conclusion. Colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery appears to be a safe approach to malignant large bowel obstruction. Possible advantages of this treatment can be identified in a reduced incidence of postoperative complications and a lower stoma rate. Further RCTs considering long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis are needed. ? 2017 Niccol? Allievi et al."

Therefore, we undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDI on postoperative pain after THA. Methods: Databases, including Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library, were searched to identify randomized controlled trials concerning PDI for pain management in patients undergoing THA. The primary outcomes included pain score with rest or activity and opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay and complications (nausea or vomiting). Results: A total of 666 THA patients from 8 randomized controlled trials were subjected to meta-analysis. The results showed that the PDI group had better pain relief, less opioid consumption, and less length of hospital, when compared with the placebo group (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in regard to visual analog score with activity and complications between the 2 groups. Conclusion: PDI may be recommended for the pain management after THA.

However, the effects of both techniques on fistula patency and failure rates are still controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis is to synthesize evidence from published randomized trials and observational studies regarding the safety and efficacy of RA versus LA in AVF surgical construction. A computer literature search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central retrieved six randomized trials (462 patients) and one retrospective study (408 patients). Pooling data using RevMan software (version 5.3) showed that RA was superior to LA in terms of primary fistula patency rate (RR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08, 1.37], p = 0.0010); however, both types were comparable in terms of primary fistula failure rate (RR = 0.81, 95% CI [0.47, 1.40], p = 0.46). In comparison to LA, RA was associated with improved hemodynamic parameters including fistula blood flow (MD = 25.08, 95% CI [19.40, 30.76], p<0.00001), brachial artery diameter (SMD = 2.63, 95% CI [2.17, 3.08], p<0.00001), and outflow venous diameter (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI [0.30, 1.75], p = 0.004). Postoperative complications were comparable between both groups (OR = 0.23, 95% CI [0.05, 0.97], p = 0.05). In conclusion, RA was associated with higher primary patency rates of AVF and improved local blood flow in comparison to LA; however, both procedures were comparable in terms of primary failure rates and postoperative complications. Larger well-designed trials with longer follow-up periods should compare both techniques in terms of long-term patency rates and safety outcomes. ? 2017 Wichtig Publishing."

However, there are inconsistencies in the associations of common genetic variants of TLR4 (D299G) and TLR9 (T-1237C and T-1486C) with malaria outcome. A comprehensive search was conducted to identify relevant and independent Plasmodium falciparum-infected case-control studies, and meta-analysis including six studies for each SNP was performed to obtain more precise estimates of the pooled effects of these variants. The results showed significant associations of the -1486C allele with the risk of severe malaria in allele contrast (T vs. C, p = 0.004, OR = 1.26) and homozygous (TT vs. CC, p = 0.03, OR = 1.51) genetic models. There was no association between the D299G or T-1237C variants and uncomplicated or severe malaria using any of the genetic models tested. However, in stratified analysis, -1237C was associated with the risk of severe malaria in Indian adults (TT vs. TC, p = 0.06, OR = 2.13; TT vs. TC+CC, p <0.00001, OR = 2.65), suggesting that our results must be considered preliminary. The robustness of -1486C as a risk factor warrants investigation into its functionality in malaria pathogenesis. Further, the lack of an association with the T-1237C variant was weak, and future studies examining more detailed individual data from different ethnic groups are essential for confirmation of its genetic contribution to malaria. ? 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and pool outcomes data available in the published literature to guide clinical decision-making and further research. Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE (1966 to April 15, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 15, 2015), CENTRAL, and Google Scholar for patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia and respiratory failure who received ECMO. The study validity was appraised by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were duration of ECMO therapy, mechanical ventilation, and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay. Results: Of 698 abstracts screened and 142 full-text articles reviewed, we included 13 studies with a total of 494 patients receiving ECMO in our final review and meta-analysis. The study validity was satisfactory. The overall mortality was 37.1% (95% confidence interval: 30-45%) limited by underlying heterogeneity (I2 = 65%, P value of Q statistic = 0.006). The median duration for ECMO was 10 days, mechanical ventilation was 19 days, and ICU length of stay was 33 days. Exploratory meta-regression did not identify any statistically significant moderator of mortality (P &lt; 0.05), except for the duration of pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation in days (coefficient 0.19, standard error: 0.09, Z = 2.01, P &lt; 0.04, R2 = 0.16). The visual inspection of funnel plots did not suggest the presence of publication bias. Conclusions: ECMO therapy may be used as an adjunct or salvage therapy for severe H1N1 pneumonia with respiratory failure. It is associated with a prolonged duration of ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and high mortality. Initiating ECMO early once the patient has been instituted on mechanical ventilation may result in improved survival. ? 2017 Annals of Cardiac Anaesthesia Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow."

The double-guidewire technique (DGT) may improve cannulation success and reduce the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) in patients with difficult cannulation. This systematic review compared the DGT with persistent conventional cannulation or other advanced techniques in patients with difficult cannulation. Patients and Methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases and DDW and UEGW abstracts up to March 2016 were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DGT with persistent conventional cannulation or other advanced techniques (precut, pancreatic duct [PD] stenting). The primary outcome was PEP. Secondary outcomes included severity of PEP, successful cannulation of the common bile duct (CBD) with the randomized technique, overall CBD cannulation success, and ERCP-related complications. Results 7 RCTs (577 patients) were included. Use of the DGT significantly increased PEP compared to other endoscopic techniques (risk ratio [RR] 1.98, 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI] 1.14 - 3.42). There was no significant difference in CBD cannulation success with the randomized technique (RR 1.04, 95 %CI 0.87 - 1.24) or in overall cannulation success (RR 1.04, 95 %CI 0.91 - 1.18) between DGT and other techniques. There was also no significant difference in the risk of other ERCP-related complications (bleeding, perforation, cholangitis, and mortality). The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In patients with difficult cannulation, sole use of the DGT appears to increase the risk of PEP without any superiority in achieving biliary cannulation compared to other techniques. PD stenting may reduce the risk of PEP when the DGT is used. The influence of co-intervention in the form of per-procedural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration is unclear. ?

Approaches to combat resistance include targeted therapy with antibiotics previously thought to be ineffective, made possible by rapid molecular assays to predict susceptibility. Previous studies have associated the gyrase A (gyrA) gene of N. gonorrhoeae with in vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin. We conducted a systematic review of studies comparing N. gonorrhoeae gyrA genotype results with conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. We identified 31 studies meeting inclusion criteria, among which 7 different loci for mutations in the gyrA gene were identified, from 16 countries between the years of 1996 and 2016. We then performed a meta-analysis among those studies stratifying by use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or non-real-time PCR technique, and compared the summary receiver operating characteristic curves between the 2 PCR methods. Among studies using real-time PCR, the pooled estimate of sensitivity and specificity of gyrA genotype results for the prediction of N. gonorrhoeae susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 98.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96.5-99.1%) and 98.6% (95% CI, 97.0-99.3%), respectively. The summary operating characteristic curves for studies using real-time PCR techniqueswerewell separated from those using non-real-time PCR techniques, with only slight overlap in the CIs, suggesting that real-time PCR techniques were a more accurate approach. GyrA genotype testing is a novel approach to combating the emergence of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae and is a sensitive and specific method to predict in vitro ciprofloxacin susceptibility."

However, the clinical spectrum and pathogenesis of severe vivax malaria and, especially, its respiratory complications remain poorly understood. A systematic search for articles reporting respiratory complications associated with vivax malaria was performed in Lilacs, Cochrane, Scielo, Web of Science, and Medline databases irrespective of publication date. Prevalence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and associated mortality among vivax patients were calculated from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, whereas factors associated with mortality were calculated from data pooled from case reports and series of cases. Atotal of 101 studies were included (49 cross-sectional or longitudinal and 52 case reports or series of cases). Prevalence of ARDS was 2.8% and 2.2% in children and adults, respectively, with nearly 50% mortality.

Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science) was performed to identify RCTs comparing nonoperative treatment with plate fixation for displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. Risk of bias of the studies was assessed. Outcomes evaluated were nonunion, shoulder function (Constant score and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand [DASH] score), and secondary operations. Results: Six RCTs (614 patients) were included. The risk of nonunion was lower in the operatively treated patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06 to 0.32). One-third of the patients with a nonunion did not receive further treatment. Secondary operations for adverse events were performed less often in the operatively treated patients (RR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.71). When plate removal operations were also included, a secondary operation was performed in 17.6% in the operative group and 16.6% in the nonoperative group (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.59). Constant and DASH scores after 1 year were somewhat better after plate fixation, with mean differences of 4.4 points (95% CI, 0.9 to 7.9 points) and 5.1 points (95% CI, 0.1 to 10.1 points), respectively. Conclusions: Plate fixation significantly reduces the risk of nonunion, but does not have a clinically relevant advantage regarding final functional outcome. Secondary operations are common after both treatments. Overall, there is not enough evidence to support routine operative treatment for all patients with a displaced midshaft clavicular fracture.

However, the results remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of acetaminophen in patients with acute stroke. Methods: Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Chinese BioMedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were systematically searched. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of acetaminophen versus placebo on the treatment of acute stroke were included. Two investigators independently searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed-effect or random-effect models. Results: Seven RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with placebo intervention in acute stroke patients, acetaminophen intervention could substantially reduce body temperature within 24 h (Mean difference [MD] =-0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]=-0.40 to -0.16; p<0.001) and mortality (odds ratio [OR]=0.62; 95% CI=0.40 to 0.95; p=0.03), but showed no significant impact on body temperature after 5 days (MD=0.04; 95% CI=-0.20 to 0.29; p=0.73), favourable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] ?2) (OR=1.05; 95% CI=0.88 to 1.27; p=0.58), and serious adverse events (OR=0.92; 95% CI=0.69 to 1.22; p=0.56). Conclusions: Acetaminophen is revealed to have favourable influence on body temperature reduction at 24 h after starting the treatment and decrease mortality in patients with acute stroke, but shows no important effect on improving favourable outcome and reducing adverse events of patients. It should be recommended for acute stroke patients. ? 2017, Medcom Limited. All rights reserved."

The aim of this study was to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nonoperative versus surgical management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed with respect to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement (end-of-search date: January 29, 2017). Data on the study design, interventions, participants, and outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. The random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) was used to calculate pooled effect estimates when substantial heterogeneity was encountered; otherwise, the fixed-effects (Mantel-Haenszel) model was implemented. Quality assessment of included RCTs was performed using the modified Jadad scale. RESULTS: Five RCTs were included in this review. Overall, 1,430 adult patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent either nonoperative (n = 727) or operative management (n = 703). Treatment efficacy at 1-year follow-up was significantly lower (63.8%) for antibiotics compared with the surgery group (93%) (risk ratio [RR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.77; p < 0.001). Overall complications were significantly higher in the surgery group (166/703 [23.6%]) compared with the antibiotics group (56/727 [7.7%]) (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.24-0.43; p < 0.001). No difference was found between the two treatment modalities in terms of perforated appendicitis rates (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.14-1.92), length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference [WMD], 0.20; 95% CI,-0.16 to 0.56), duration of pain (WMD, 0.22; 95% CI,-5.30 to-5.73), and sick leave (WMD,-2; 95% CI,-5.2 to 1.1).

The present meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether choice of ADM products can affect outcomes. Methods: Studies that used multiple kinds of ADM products for implant-based breast reconstruction and compared outcomes between them were searched. Outcomes of interest were rates of postoperative complications: infection, seroma, mastectomy flap necrosis, reconstruction failure, and overall complications. Results: A total of 17 studies met the selection criteria. There was only 1 randomized controlled trial, and the other 16 studies had retrospective designs. Comparison of FlexHD, DermaMatrix, and ready-to-use AlloDerm with freeze-dried AlloDerm was conducted in multiple studies and could be meta-analyzed, in which 12 studies participated. In the meta-analysis comparing FlexHD and freeze-dried AlloDerm, using the results of 6 studies, both products showed similar pooled risks for all kinds of complications. When comparing DermaMatrix and freeze-dried AlloDerm with the results from 4 studies, there were also no differences between the pooled risks of complications of the two. Similarly, the meta-analysis of 4 studies comparing ready-to-use and freeze-dried AlloDerm demonstrated that the pooled risks for the complications did not differ. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates that the 3 recently invented, human cadaveric skin-based products of FlexHD, DermaMatrix, and ready-to-use AlloDerm have similar risks of complications compared with those of freezedried AlloDerm, which has been used for longer. However, as most studies had low levels of evidence, further investigations are needed. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2017,Pharmacogenomics,10.2217/pgs-2016-0158,27992285,"Aim: Identifying the predictors of responsiveness and adverse events in methotrexate (MTX) treated patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been the focus of most concern, but still without consistent consensus. Methods: PubMed and OVID EMBASE were searched to collect relevant studies that addressed correlations between gene polymorphisms and efficacy and/or toxicity in MTX-treated RA patients. Allelic, recessive, dominant and over-dominant model were applied. Results: A total of 68 studies were included. For associations with efficacy, AMPD1 34C>T polymorphism was related to responsiveness in dominant model (odds ratio [OR]: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.19-2.63) and over-dominant model (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.04-2.45). ATIC T675C polymorphism had association with responsiveness in recessive model (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.23-5.26). For associations with toxicity, polymorphisms in TYMS 1494 del6 and FPGS rs10106 were correlated to absenting overall adverse events in recessive model (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.95) and dominant model (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.35-0.83) respectively while MTHFR C677T was associated with presenting overall adverse events in allelic model (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.02-1.63), recessive model (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.00-1.89) and dominant model (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.02-1.94). Conclusion: Polymorphisms in AMPD1 34C>T and ATIC T675C predict responsiveness. The absence of TYMS 1494 del6 and FPGS rs10106 and presence of MTHFR C677T predict adverse events in RA patients treated with MTX. Moreover, variations of the associations were found between Caucasians and non-Caucasians. ? 2017 Future Medicine Ltd."

However, the clinical significance of CDH gene methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods: Based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, available studies were identified from online electronic database. The overall odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and analyzed. Results: A total of 29 eligible studies with 2562 HCC samples and 1685 controls were included. E-cadherin (CDH1) hypermethylation was observed to be significantly higher in HCC than in benign, adjacent, or normal samples. Moreover, CDH1 hypermethylation was not associated with gender, tumor grade, clinical stage, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HCC patients. H-cadherin (CDH13), protocadherin-10 (PCDH10), P-cadherin (CDH3), and CDH15 methylation may have an increased risk of HCC in fewer than 4 studies, and methylated CDH8 and CDH11 had a similar OR in HCC and adjacent samples. When HCC samples were compared with normal samples, the analysis of sample type revealed a significantly higher OR in normal blood samples than in normal tissues for hypermethylated CDH1 (50.82 vs 4.44). Conclusion:CDH1 hypermethylation may play a key role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. However, CDH1 hypermethylation was not correlated with clinicopathological features. Methylated CDH13, PCDH10, CDH3, and CDH15, but not methylated CDH8 or CDH11, may lead to an increased risk of HCC. Hypermethylated CDH1 may become a noninvasive blood biomarker.

We reviewed existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of flibanserin in treating HSDD, and performed a meta-analysis of reported effects. Method: Literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane library to find all trials on the efficacy of flibanserin in HSDD. Meta-analysis was performed using fixed-and random-effects models. Egger's test and trim and fill methods were used for the assessment of publication bias and imputation of potentially missing studies, respectively. Results: Among 105 studies that were initially found, only ten related documents (six published and four nonpublished studies) were included in the final analysis, comprising 8345 subjects (6113 and 2232 subjects in the flibanserin and placebo groups, respectively). Incomplete outcome data bias was probable in the included studies. Most studies had an acceptable validity and quality. There was no significant difference between flibanserin and placebo groups in most of the HSDD-assessed indices. Our results showed that although SSE, DSDS, FSFID and FSFI are significantly improved with flibanserin, this change did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo. For FSDSR-item 13 score and FSDSR total score, no significant difference was observed between flibanserin and placebo. The most common side effect of flibanserin was somnolence. The most common causes of heterogeneity were black ethnicity, duration of therapy, age of participants and duration of marital relationship. Conclusion: the efficacy of flibanserin in women with HSDD was not found to be significantly different compared with placebo. Additional trials are required to clarify the efficacy of flibanserin for the treatment of HSDD. ? 2017 Bentham Science Publishers."

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of down-titration (dose reduction/tapering) strategies compared with continuation of biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who achieved and maintained low disease activity or remission. Methods. We searched the following electronic database up to March 2016: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR). Our meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of RA patients with low disease activity or in remission that compared down-titration treatment with continuation treatment. Data on flare, defined as a 28-joint Disease Activity Score of ?3.2, had to have been reported. Outcomes on efficacy or safety were collected. Results. Of 1136 references identified, five RCTs (total, 771 participants) were included. The incidence of disease relapse in the down-titration and continuation groups was similar (risk ratio (RR)=1.14, 95% CI=0.88-1.49). There was no statistical difference in the number of serious adverse events (RR=1.15, 95% CI=0.53-2.49). Withdrawals due to inefficacy or toxicity were similar between groups and no clinically meaningful difference in efficacy outcomes was observed by continuation treatment. Conclusion. Our findings indicated that continuing a standard dose of biological DMARDs in patients with low disease activity conveyed no significant benefit as compared with down-titration therapy, suggesting that a down-titration strategy is as effective as a continuation strategy. Since the number of trials meeting the criteria for this metaanalysis was relatively low, future analyses with additional prospective RCTs are required to compare other biological agents and evaluate the long-term efficacy of these two strategies. ?

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the short-term association between ambient air pollution and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. We searched the Web of Science and PubMed for indexed publications up to January 2017. Pollutant-specific excess risk percentage (ER%) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effect models for particulate matter (PM) with diameter ? 10 (PM10) and ?2.5 £gm (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Results were further stratified by subgroups (children under five, emergency visits versus hospital admissions, income level of study location, and exposure period). Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. The ER% per 10 £gg/m3 increase of pollutants was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.6%¡V2.4%) for PM10 and 1.8% (95% CI: 0.5%¡V3.1%) for PM2.5. The corresponding values per 10 ppb increment of gaseous pollutants were 2.9% (95% CI: 0.4%¡V5.3%) for SO2, 1.7% (95% CI: 0.5%¡V2.8%) for O3, and 1.4% (95% CI: 0.4%¡V2.4%) for NO2. ER% per 1000 ppb increment of CO was 0.9% (95% CI: 0.0%¡V1.9%). Associations were not substantially different between subgroups. This meta-analysis shows a positive association between daily levels of ambient air pollution markers and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. However, lack of studies from low-and middle-income countries limits the quantitative generalizability given that susceptibilities to the adverse effects of air pollution may be different in those populations. The meta-regression in our analysis further demonstrated a strong effect of country income level on heterogeneity. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd"

Recently, endoscopic ultrasound guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has been described. Primary outcomes were to evaluate the biliary drainage success rates with EUS and compare it to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate overall procedure related complications. Methods: Study selection criteria: Studies evaluating the efficacy of EUS-BD and comparing EUS-BD versus PTBD in inoperable malignant biliary stricture patients with a failed ERCP were included in this analysis. Data collection and extraction: Articles were searched in Medline, PubMed, and Ovid journals. Two authors independently searched and extracted data. The study design was written in accordance to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Subgroup analyses of prospective studies and EUS-BD versus PTBD were performed. Statistical method: Pooled proportions were calculated using fixed and random effects model. I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity among studies. Results: Initial search identified 846 reference articles, of which 124 were selected and reviewed. Sixteen studies (N = 528) that met the inclusion criteria were included in this analysis. In the pooled patient population, the percentage of patients that had a successful biliary drainage with EUS was 90.91% (95% CI =88.10-93.38). The proportion of patients that had overall procedure related complications with EUS-PD was 16.46% (95% CI = 13.20-20.01). The pooled odds ratio for successful biliary drainage in EUS-PD versus PTBD group was 3.06 (95% CI = 1.11-8.43). The risk difference for overall procedure related complications in EUS-PD versus PTBD group was - 0.21 (95% CI = - 0.35 to - 0.06). Relative risk for infectious complications and bile leak in EUS-BD versus PTBD was 0.25 (95% CI =0.07-0.94) and 0.33 (95% CI =0.12-0.87), respectively. Conclusions: In patients with inoperable malignant biliary strictures who failed an ERCP guided biliary stenting, EUS-BD seems to be an excellent management option and superior to PTBD with higher successful biliary drainage rates and relatively fewer complications.

Methods: Literatures were carefully searched in databases including PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Chinese VIP Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Database from the construction date of the databases to August 2014. The experimental (DPPI + MET) group orally took DPP-4 inhibitors and MET, while control (MET) group only orally took MET or MET + placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and pancreatic islet cell function were the main outcome indices. Hypoglycemia and other adverse reactions were secondary outcome indices. Methodology quality evaluation of included random?ized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using the ¡§bias risk assessment tool¡¨ in Cochrane Review Manager version 5.2. The heterogeneity among the included studies was examined using £q2 test. Results: A total of 22 RCTs and 13,987 subjects were finally included in the meta-analysis.

Similarly, combined use of DPP-4 inhibitors and MET had better efficacy than MET alone in improving pancreatic islet £] cell function. These results were not altered by changes in duration of treatments. Combined use of DPP-4 inhibitors and MET or MET alone had low risks for total adverse events or hypoglycemia. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that the combination of DPP-4 inhibitors and MET has better efficacy than MET alone in controlling blood sugar level and improving pancreatic islet £] cell function during the treatment of T2DM.

Methods: We performed a systematic search of English language original studies published between January 1, 2004 and September 30, 2015 using Medline, Web of Science, LILACS, AIM, IMEMR, and WPIMR databases. We calculated the odds of being adherent at higher CD4 count compared with lower CD4 count according to study definitions and pooled data using random effects models. Results: Twenty-eight articles were included in the review and 18 in the meta-analysis. The odds of being adherent was marginally lower for patients in the higher CD4 count group (pooled odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.96); however, the majority of studies found no difference in the odds of adherence when comparing CD4 count strata. In analyses restricted to comparisons above and below a CD4 count of 500 cells per microliter, there was no difference in adherence (pooled odds ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 to 1.05). Conclusions: This review was unable to find consistent evidence of differences in adherence according to baseline CD4 count. Although this is encouraging for the new recommendations to treat all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of CD4 count, there is a need for additional high-quality studies, particularly among adults initiating ART at higher CD4 cell counts. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Methodology/Principal findings: A systematic review in according with PRISMA guidelines was conducted. All published articles available in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and CINAHL databases before May 20, 2015 were searched without any limits. Two reviewers independently screened, reviewed and assessed all the studies. Cochrane Q and Moran¡¦s I2were used to assess heterogeneity and the Egger test was used to examine publication bias. The summary odds ratio (OR), summary regression co-efficient (£]) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a random-effects model. Out of 2,920 citations screened, 12 articles (five cross-sectional, seven prospective cohort) were eligible to be included in the systematic review and 11 in the meta-analysis. The 12 studies involved 9,337 children in eight SSA countries. Eight studies compared the odds of asymptomatic/uncomplicated P. falciparum infection, two studies compared the incidence of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection, six studies compared P. falciparum density and four studies compared mean haemoglobin level between children infected and uninfected with S. haematobium or S. mansoni. Summary estimates of the eight studies based on 6,018 children showed a higher odds of asymptomatic/uncomplicated P. falciparum infection in children infected with S. mansoni or S. haematobium compared to those uninfected with Schistosoma (summary OR: 1.82; 95%CI: 1.41, 2.35; I2: 52.3%). The increase in odds of asymptomatic/uncomplicated P. falciparum infection among children infected with Schistosoma remained significant when subgroup analysis was conducted for S. haematobium (summary OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.18, 2.41; I2: 53.2%) and S. mansoni (summary OR: 2.15; 95%CI: 1.89, 2.46: I2: 0.0%) infection. However, the density of P. falciparum infection was lower in children co-infected with S. haematobium compared to those uninfected with Schistosoma (summary-£]: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.24, -0.01; I2: 39.7%).

Data Sources: Papers written in Persian or English were identified during a comprehensive search within five national and four international main databases. Study Eligibility Criteria and Participants: Studies reported the HBV infection prevalence among Iranian pregnant women and provided enough quality scores were selected for this meta-analysis. Methods: After a systematic review of national and international databases, duplicated and irrelevant studies were excluded. Standard error of the infection prevalence was calculated based on the binomial distribution. Because of the significant heterogeneity observed among the results, random effects model was applied to combine the results of the primary studies. Moreover, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression models were used to detect the sources of this heterogeneity. Results: At final step of the systematic search, 18 papers entered into the meta-analysis investigating 24853 pregnant women. Prevalence of HBV infection among Iranian pregnant women was estimated as 1.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.9 - 1.6).

Results Out of 1828 non-duplicate citations, 16 studies reporting a total of 7374 cases of UTI were included. The prevalence of ESBL-PE was 14% [(95%CI 8, 21)]. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) [OR?=?2.79, (95%CI 1.39, 5.58)], history of UTI [OR?=?2.89 (95%CI 1.78, 4.68)] and recent antibiotic use [OR?=?3.92, (95%CI 1.76, 8.7)] were identified as risk factors. The LOS was significantly longer among children infected with ESBL-PE, compared to those infected with other uropathogens. [SMD?=?0.88, (95%CI 0.40, 1.35)]. Conclusions In the paediatric population, 1 out of 7 UTIs are caused by ESBL-PE. Patients with VUR, previous UTI or recent antibiotic use constitute a high risk group and these pathogens are associated with increased LOS. The significant incidence of ESBL-PE in this population should be taken into consideration in the development of empiric treatment protocols and antibiotic stewardship programmes, especially in high-prevalence areas. ? 2016 The British Infection Association"

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of perioperative NSAIDs application on complications after gastrointestinal surgery by using meta-analysis. Methods A systematic review of published literature was conducted by searching computerized databases including PubMed, CBM, Springer, Chinese Academic Journals, and China Info since the databases were published until June 2015. The articles and retrospective references regarding complications after gastrointestinal surgery were collected to compare postoperative complications associated with NSAIDs or other analgesics. After they were assessed by randomized controlled trials and extracted by the standard of the Jadad systematic review, the homogeneous studies were pooled using RevMan 5.3 software. The meta-analysis was performed on five postoperative complications: postoperative anastomotic leak, cardiovascular events, surgical site infection, nausea and vomiting, and intestinal obstruction. Results Twelve randomized controlled trials involving 3829 patients met the inclusion criteria. The results of meta-analyses showed the following: (1) postoperative anastomotic leak: NSAIDs (including selective and nonselective NSAIDs) increased the incidence of anastomotic leak [odds ratio (OR)?=?3.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.16¡V4.23, p?=?0.00001]. Further results showed that nonselective NSAIDs significantly increased the incidence of anastomotic leak (OR?=?2.96, 95% CI: 1.99¡V4.42, p?<?0.00001), and selective NSAIDs had no significant difference as compared with the control group using other analgesics (OR?=?2.27, 95% CI: 0.68¡V7.56, p?=?0.18); (2) postoperative cardiovascular events: NSAIDs (selective and nonselective NSAIDs) had no difference when compared with other analgesics (OR?=?0.50, 95% CI: 0.23¡V1.12, p?=?0.09); (3) postoperative surgical site infection: NSAIDs (selective and nonselective NSAIDs) and other analgesics had no difference in surgical site infection (OR?=?0.77, 95% CI: 0.52¡V1.15, p?=?0.20); (4) postoperative nausea and vomiting: NSAIDs (selective and nonselective NSAIDs) decreased the incidence of nausea and vomiting (OR?=?0.53, 95% CI: 0.34¡V0.81, p?=?0.003); (5) postoperative intestinal obstruction: NSAIDs (selective and nonselective NSAIDs) decreased the incidence of intestinal obstruction (OR?=?0.35, 95% CI: 0.13¡V0.89, p?=?0.03). Conclusions The meta-analysis suggests that postoperative NSAIDs, especially nonselective NSAIDs, could increase the incidence of anastomotic leak. NSAIDs could decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting and intestinal obstruction, but showed no difference in cardiovascular events and surgical site infection as compared with other analgesics. ? 2016"

A review and meta-analysis of observational studies,2016,Clinical Transplantation,10.1111/ctr.12854,27653443,"Background: Lung transplant (LTX) recipients are at high risk of invasive Aspergillus infections (IAI). However, no randomized-controlled trials (RCT) or international guidelines on antifungal prophylaxis (AFP) in the LTX population exist. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to determine whether AFP reduces the rate of IAI after LTX. A total of six eligible observational studies (five with no prophylaxis, one with targeted prophylaxis, three studies including heart/lung transplantation) with a total of 748 patients were included. Results: The pooled odds ratio (OR) for IAI (62 IFI in the intervention arm and 82 in the control group) was 0.234 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.097-0.564, P=0.001, z=?3.237). Pooled studies were characterized by substantial heterogeneity (I2=66.64%); number needed to treat was 6.8. A subgroup analyses with exclusion of heart transplant recipients also showed a statistically significant reduction in IAI with AFP (OR 0.183, 95% CI 0.0449-0.744, P=0.018). Conclusion: This study suggests that universal antifungal prophylaxes reduces incidence of IAI after LTX. However, included studies are limited by small sample size, single-center structure without randomization, mixed population (including heart/heart-lung transplant), and heterogeneity due to variations in immunosuppression, type, and duration of AFP. Therefore, there is a clear need for an adequately powered RCT. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

This meta-analysis aims to compare time-limited and volume-controlled strategies for drain removal. Methods A total of 584 titles were identified following a systematic literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cinahl and the Cochrane library; 6 titles met our eligibility criteria. Data were extracted and independently verified by two authors. Time-limited drain removal was defined as drain removal at <5 days; volume-controlled strategies ranged from <20?ml/24?h to <50?ml/24?h. Results In all the studies, the time-limited approach resulted in earlier drain removal. Development of a seroma is 2.54 times more likely with early drain removal (Mantel-Haenszel Fixed Odds Ratio (OR) 2.54, p?<?0.00001). However, there is no difference in infection rates between early and late drain removal (OR?=?1.07, p?=?0.76). Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrates that a strategy of early drain removal following axillary lymphadenectomy is safe, with no difference in infection rates; however, the incidence of seroma is significantly higher, which may necessitate more demanding outpatient care. There is a need for further well-designed clinical trials to address the clinical equipoise in this common area of surgical practice. ? 2016 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons"

This study aimed to estimate the prevalence, antimicrobial susceptibility and serotype distribution of GBS isolates in pregnant women worldwide. Studies were identified by searching several English and Chinese electronic databases and reviewing relevant articles. Effect estimates were pooled using fixed- or random-effects models. Twenty-eight studies were included in this systematic review. The pooled prevalence of GBS carriage in pregnant women was 10%, being significantly lower in Asia (7%) compared with non-Asian countries (19%). Most of the GBS isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and vancomycin. The pooled rates of resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin were 25% and 27%, respectively, and were notably higher in Asia compared with non-Asian countries. The pooled rate of resistance to tetracycline was 73%, with similar high levels in Asia and non-Asian countries. The most prevalent serotypes of GBS isolates were serotypes III, V and Ia. These findings suggest that penicillin is still the first choice for intrapartum prophylaxis of GBS diseases and support growing concern about antibiotic use (especially erythromycin and clindamycin) in Asia. ? 2016 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer"

Methods: A literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in adult patients undergoing open mesh repair of groin hernia was performed in November 2015. Incidence of overall and deep SSI was considered as primary and secondary outcome measures, respectively. Only studies with a clear definition of SSI and a follow-up of at least 1?month were included. Effect size from each RCT was computed as odds ratio (OR) and 95?% confidence interval (CI) and then data were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: Sixteen RCTs with a total number of 5519 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Considering all the RCTs, antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the overall incidence of SSI from 4.8?% to 3.2?% [OR 0.68, 95?% CI (0.51¡V0.91)]. However, after removal of two outlier studies, which were identified by evaluating the standardized residual, the result of the meta-analysis became non-significant [OR 0.76, 95?% CI (0.56¡V1.02)]. The incidence of deep SSI was very low (0¡V0.7?%) and the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis was not significant [OR 0.80, 95?% CI (0.32¡V1.99)]. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis do not support the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis for the open mesh repair of groin hernia. In clinical settings with unexpectedly high rates of SSIs, the appropriateness of surgical asepsis should be carefully checked. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag France."

The PubMed database was explored by 2 independent researchers. We used the following search terms: ¡§Blood transfusion (MESH); transfusion need; fluid therapy (MESH); permissive hypotension; fluid management; resuscitation; restrictive fluid management; liberal fluid management; elective surgery; damage control resuscitation; surgical procedures, operative (MESH); wounds (MESH); injuries (MESH); surgery; trauma patients.¡¨ A secondary search in the Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library revealed no additional results. We selected randomized controlled trials performed during elective surgeries. Patients were randomly assigned to a restrictive fluid management policy or to a liberal fluid management policy during elective surgery. The patient characteristics and the type of surgery varied. All but 3 studies reported American Society of Anaesthesiologists groups 1 to 3 as the inclusion criterion. The primary outcome of interest is total number of patients with a complication and the complication rate. Secondary outcome measures are infection rate, transfusion need, postoperative rebleeding, hospital stay, and renal function. In total, 1397 patients were analyzed (693 restrictive protocol, 704 liberal protocol). Meta-analysis showed that in the restrictive group as compared with the liberal group, fewer patients experienced a complication (relative risk [RR], 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.78). The total complication rate (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.64), risk of infection (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.79), and transfusion rate (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66-0.99) were also lower. The postoperative rebleeding did not differ in both groups: RR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.28-2.06). We conclude that compared with a liberal fluid policy, a restrictive fluid policy in elective surgery results in a 35% reduction in patients with a complication and should be advised as the preferred fluid management policy. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Conclusion: Percutaneous access demonstrates advantages over conventional surgical exposure for endovascular aneurysm repair, as indicated by access-related complications and hospital length of stay. Further research is required to define its impact on resource utilization, cost-effectiveness and quality of life. ? 2016, ? The Author(s) 2016."

Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in December 2010 and April 2015 for economic evaluations in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Web sites and databases from medical societies, experts, and associations related to the topic, proceedings or congressional annals, and doctoral theses were also searched. No language or temporal restriction was applied. We included randomized controlled trials, economic evaluations, and systematic reviews evaluating antibody response, cost-effectiveness, and effectiveness of PCVs' interchangeability. A Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology-based checklist was used to assess the risk of bias in observational studies and a Cochrane approach for experimental/quasi-experimental studies. Pairs of reviewers independently selected (through the Web-based Early Reviewer Organizer Software), assessed the quality, and extracted the data of the studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We planned to perform meta-analysis whenever appropriate. Results: Forty-six of 202 studies were included. There was no direct information available on the interchangeability between PCVs. The immunogenicity and safety between the 10-valent PCV (PCV10) and the 7-valent PCV were similar when both vaccines were coadministered with other routine pediatric vaccines. PCV10 and 13-valent PCV (PCV13) were consistently more cost-effective than 7-valent PCV. Conclusions: There was no direct comparative information available on the interchangeability among PCVs, but they have pretty similar immunogenicity and safety. PCV10 versus PCV13 cost-effectiveness varied according to price, indirect effects, and indirect costs. PCV10 gains more quality-adjusted life-years because of the prevention of more frequent yet less severe events such as otitis media, and PCV13 prevents less frequent but more costly events such as invasive diseases. ? 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)."

However, the associated evidence base is ambiguous. Aim To examine factors affecting microbial growth in PN. Methods A systematic review with meta-analyses examined effects of nutrients on microbial growth in PN infusates over a 48-h period using the growth ratio {GR=log10[colony-forming units (cfu)/mL at 48?h/cfu/mL at time zero]}. Findings Factors influencing GR in PN included glucose, microbial species, temperature, osmolarity, presence of vitamins, trace elements and lipid, and amino acid profile. Using unmatched datasets (N=306), a general linear model found that lipid inclusion in PN represented 3.3% of the variability, which was less than that due to glucose concentration (5.8%), microbial species (35.3%) and microbe¡Vinfusate interaction (4.4%). Using matched datasets (N=38 pairs), lipid inclusion in PN represented 5.4% of the variability (P=0.076), which was less than that due to glucose concentration (8.5%; P=0.025), microbial species (75.5%; P&lt;0.001) and microbe¡Vinfusate interaction (13.3%; P=0.382). Using meta-analyses of matched datasets, the presence of lipid in PN at fixed glucose concentrations did not significantly increase GR of Candida albicans, Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus epidermidis (P=0.352, P=0.025 and P=0.494, respectively; overall P=0.175). Conclusion Lipid inclusion in PN is only one of several factors that may influence microbial growth in PN. Any recommendations about the duration of PN infusion from a single container should account for all these factors, and should be weighted according to microbial species likely to contaminate PN. ? 2016 The Healthcare Infection Society"

We aimed to assess its safety and effects using a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies assessing adults with bacteraemia, microbiologically documented pneumonia or severe sepsis, comparing between antibiotic de-escalation and no de-escalation. De-escalation was defined as changing an initially covering antibiotic regimen to a narrower spectrum regimen based on antibiotic susceptibility testing results within 96 hours. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A search of published articles and conference proceedings was last updated in September 2015. Crude and adjusted ORs with 95% CI were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Sixteen observational studies and three RCTs were included. Risk of bias related to confounding was high in the observational studies. De-escalation was associated with fewer deaths in the unadjusted analysis (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.39¡V0.73), 19 studies, moderate heterogeneity. In the adjusted analysis there was no significant difference in mortality (adjusted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59¡V1.16), 11 studies, moderate heterogeneity and the RCTs showed non-significant increased mortality with de-escalation (OR 1.73, 95% 0.97¡V3.06), three trials, no heterogeneity. There was a significant unadjusted association between de-escalation and survival in bacteraemia/severe sepsis (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30¡V0.67) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.26¡V0.95), but not with other pneumonia (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45¡V2.12). Only two studies reported on the emergence of resistance with inconsistent findings. Observational studies suggest lower mortality with antibiotic susceptibility testing-based de-escalation for bacteraemia, severe sepsis and ventilator-associated pneumonia that was not demonstrated in RCTs. ? 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

Therefore they are prone to develop frequent and often foot problems with a relative high risk of infection, gangrene and amputation. In addition, altered plantar pressure distribution is an important etiopathogenic risk factor for the development of foot ulcers. Thus the review on study of foot kinematic and kinetic in type 2 diabetes mellitus to understand the biomechanical changes is important. Methodology: Scientific articles were obtained using electronic databases including Science Direct, CINAHL, Springer Link, Medline, Web of Science, and Pubmed. The selection was completed after reading the full texts. Studies using experimental design with focus on biomechanics of diabetic foot were selected. Results: The meta-analysis report on gait velocity (neuropathy?=?128 and non-diabetes?=?131) showed that there was a significantly lower gait velocity in neuropathy participants compared to non-diabetes age matched participants at a high effect level (?0.09, 95?% CI ?0.13 to 0.05; p?<?0.0001).

Thus, effective interventions to reduce Salmonella contamination during beef and pork processing are of interest to both regulators and the meat industry. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-Analysis of literature investigating the efficacy of slaughter and processing interventions to control Salmonella in beef and pork. Review steps included a comprehensive search strategy, relevance screening of abstracts, relevance confirmation of articles, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment, meta-Analysis (where appropriate), and a weight-of-evidence assessment. A total of 191 relevant experimental studies were identified. The results of two controlled trials indicated that hot water and steam treatments were effective for reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on beef carcasses (relative risk [RR] = 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.58), whereas in four trials, prechill organic acid washes were effective for reducing Salmonella on pork carcasses (RR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.78), with high confidence in the estimates of effect. In four quasi-experimental studies, postexsanguination chemical washes were effective for reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on cattle hides, with low confidence in the specific estimate of effect; however, moderate confidence was found for the effect estimates of scalding (RR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.29) and singeing (RR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.22, 0.52) of pork carcasses. The overall evidence supports enhanced reductions of Salmonella through a multihurdle approach. Various slaughter and processing interventions can contribute to reduction of Salmonella on beef and pork carcasses, depending on the context of application, and an appropriate combination should be selected, validated, and verified by establishment operators under their local conditions.

However, some THA procedures require revision due to mechanical or biological failure. The purpose of this study was to synthesize and examine the evidence on the relative risk of revision in men and women after primary THA procedures. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review of cohort studies reporting THA revision risk estimate by gender. Study quality scoring and a random effects meta-analysis were performed to estimate the meta¡Vrelative risk (meta-RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of revision, comparing men to women. Results Males had a statistically significant increased risk of revision after primary THA (meta-RR?= 1.33 [95% CI: 1.13-1.57]), when compared to females. When stratified by cause of revision, males had a statistically significant increased risk of revision due to any cause (meta-RR?= 1.16 [95% CI: 1.01-1.33]), aseptic loosening (meta-RR?= 1.54 [95% CI: 1.05-2.25]), and infection (meta-RR?= 1.55 [95% CI: 1.11-2.15]). For primary THA operations performed during the 2000s, males in Europe had a statistically significant increased risk of revision (meta-RR 1.42 [95% CI: 1.25-1.61]) while males in the United States had a statistically significant decreased risk of revision (meta-RR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72-0.89]). Conclusion These results provide evidence for an increased risk of revision after THA among males, which may be impacted by geographic location and time period of operation. Findings suggest that a better understanding of the underlying drivers of gender-specific risks would help reduce postsurgery complications. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The effects of PPI therapy on risks of fundic gland polyps (FGPs) and gastric cancer have received considerable attention. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies that assessed these risks. Methods We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for relevant studies published through July 2015. We calculated pooled odds ratio for FGPs and the risk ratio for gastric cancer in PPI users compared with PPI nonusers using fixed- and random-effects models. Results We analyzed data from 12 studies, comprising more than 87,324 patients: 1 randomized controlled trial reporting the effect of PPIs on gastric polyps (location not specified), 6 cohort and 1 case-control studies on FGPs, and 1 cohort and 3 case-control studies on gastric cancer. Pooled odds ratios for FGPs were 1.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.24¡V1.64) and 2.45 (95% confidence interval, 1.24¡V4.83) from fixed- and random-effects models, respectively. The pooled risk ratio for gastric cancer was 1.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.23¡V1.66) from each model. We observed significant heterogeneity among studies reporting on FGPs, but not among studies reporting on gastric cancer. Conclusions Based on a systematic review with meta-analysis, long-term use of PPIs (?12 months) is associated with an increased risk of FGPs. PPI therapy might also increase the risk of gastric cancer, but this association could be biased, because of the limited number of studies and possible confounding factors. ? 2016 AGA Institute"

A systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses,2016,International Journal of Surgery,10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.11.014,27838385,"Objective There is discordance in the results from meta-analyses on surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture. We systematically reviewed the overlapping meta-analyses on this topic to provide information that will be helpful to decision makers when selecting treatments based on the current best available evidence. Methods We comprehensively searched multiple databases for systematic reviews that compared surgical and non-surgical treatments for acute Achilles tendon rupture. We only included meta-analyses that comprised randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The methodological quality and extracted data were assessed. The meta-analysis that offered the best evidence was ascertained with the Jadad decision algorithm. Results Nine meta-analyses were included in our study and all of them included RCTs with Level-II evidence. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scores ranged from 5 to 10 (median 7). The Jadad decision algorithm was used to select a high-quality meta-analysis with more RCTs. The results from this study showed that when functional rehabilitation was used, non-surgical intervention was similar to surgical treatment regarding the incidence of range of motion, rerupture, calf circumference and functional outcomes, and the incidence of other complications was reduced. Non-surgical intervention significantly increased the rerupture rate if functional rehabilitation was not considered. Conclusions The findings of meta-analyses regarding surgical versus non-surgical treatment for acute Achilles tendon rupture are inconsistent. According to this systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses, the current best available evidence suggests that centers offering functional rehabilitation may prefer non-surgical intervention. Surgical treatment may be preferred at centers that do not have functional rehabilitation. ? 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

We aimed to investigate if interventions administering dietary doses up to the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) of iron and zinc within the window from conception to age 2 years have the potential to influence nutritional status and development of children. To address this objective, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized fortification, biofortification, and supplementation trials in women (pregnant and lactating) and children (6-23 months) delivering iron or zinc in doses up to the recommended nutrient intake (RNI) levels was conducted. Supplying iron or zinc during pregnancy had no effects on birth outcomes. There were limited or no data on the effects of iron/zinc during pregnancy and lactation on child iron/zinc status, growth, morbidity, and psychomotor and mental development. Delivering up to 15 mg iron/day during infancy increased mean hemoglobin by 4 g/L (p < 0.001) and mean serum ferritin concentration by 17.6 ?g/L (p < 0.001) and reduced the risk for anemia by 41% (p < 0.001), iron deficiency by 78% (ID; p < 0.001) and iron deficiency anemia by 80% (IDA; p < 0.001), but had no effect on growth or psychomotor development. Providing up to 10 mg of additional zinc during infancy increased plasma zinc concentration by 2.03 ?mol/L (p < 0.001) and reduced the risk of zinc deficiency by 47% (p < 0.001). Further, we observed positive effects on child weight for age z-score (WAZ) (p < 0.05), weight for height z-score (WHZ) (p < 0.05), but not on height for age z-score (HAZ) or the risk for stunting, wasting, and underweight. There are no studies covering the full 1000 days window and the effects of iron and zinc delivered during pregnancy and lactation on child outcomes are ambiguous, but low dose daily iron and zinc use during 6-23 months of age has a positive effect on child iron and zinc status. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

In this review we examine whether healthcare facility design is a contributing factor to multifaceted infection control strategies. Methods: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to December 31st, 2015, with language restriction to English, Spanish, German and French. Results: We identified three studies investigating accessibility of the location of the antiseptic hand rub dispenser. Each of them showed a significant improvement of hand hygiene compliance or agent consumption with the implementation of accessible dispensers near the patient bed. Nine eligible studies evaluated the impact of single-patient rooms on the acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infections in comparison to multi-bedrooms or an open ward design. Six of these studies showed a significant benefit of single-patient bedrooms in reducing the healthcare-associated colonization and infection rate, whereas three studies found that single-patient rooms are neither a protective nor risk factor. In meta-analyses, the overall risk ratio for acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infection was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74), for healthcare-associated colonization 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) and for bacteremia 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.76), all in favor of patient care in single-patient bedrooms. Conclusion: Implementation of single-patient rooms and easily accessible hand rub dispensers located near the patient's bed are beneficial for infection control and are useful parts of a multifaceted strategy for reducing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

Results: Six eligible clinical studies (189,709 individuals in total) were included in the analysis. There was no association between HBsAg seropositive status and prevalence of CKD, the summary estimate for adjusted relative risk (RR) was 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.78, 1.71; p =.46) according to the random-effects model, and between studies heterogeneity was noted (p values by Q test?<0.001). Also, there were no significant associations between positive HBV serologic status and low eGFR (adjusted relative risk, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.72, 1.26; p =.72) or proteinuria (adjusted relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83, 1.20; p =.99). Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows that there was no association between exposure to HBV and the risk of developing CKD in Asian populations. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

We searched randomised studies in Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) and Web of Science databases up to April 2015. Primary outcomes were total HABSI, central line, and noncentral line-associated BSI rates per patient-days. Secondary outcomes included Gram-negative and Gram-positive BSI rates and adverse events. Four randomised crossover trials involved 25 ICUs and 22,850 patients. Meta-analysis identified a total HABSI rate reduction (odds ratio (OR): 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60¡V0.90; p = 0.002) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 36%). Subgroup analysis identified significantly stronger rate reductions (p = 0.01) for CLABSI (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.35¡V0.71; p &lt; 0.001) than other HABSI (OR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70¡V0.97; p = 0.02) with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). This effect was evident in the Gram-positive subgroup (OR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31¡V0.99; p = 0.05), but became non-significant after removal of a high-risk-of-bias study. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the intervention effect remained significant for total and central line-associated HABSI. We suggest that use of CHG washcloths prevents HABSI and CLABSI in ICUs, possibly due to the reduction in Gram-positive skin commensals. ? 2016, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Pharmacists serve as educators, facilitators, and in some jurisdictions, as administrators of vaccines. Though pharmacists have been involved with immunizations in various ways for many years, there has yet to be a systematic review assessing the impact of pharmacists as immunizers in these three roles. Objective To complete a systematic review of the literature on the impact of pharmacists as educators, facilitators, and administrators of vaccines on immunization rates. Methods We identified 2825 articles searching the following databases from inception until October 2015: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Libraries, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, Google Scholar. Grey literature was identified through use of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health ¡§Grey Matters¡¨ search tool. Content from relevant journals and references of included studies were also searched. Inclusion criteria were clinical or epidemiologic studies in which pharmacists were involved in the immunization process. Studies were excluded if no comparator was reported. Two reviewers independently completed data extraction and bias assessments using standardized forms. Results Thirty-six studies were included in the review, 22 assessed the role of pharmacists as educators and/or facilitators and 14 assessed their role as administrators of vaccines. All studies reviewed found an increase in vaccine coverage when pharmacists were involved in the immunization process, regardless of role (educator, facilitator, administrator) or vaccine administered (e.g., influenza, pneumococcal), when compared to vaccine provision by traditional providers without pharmacist involvement. Limitations of the results include the large number of non-randomized trials and the heterogeneity between study designs. Conclusions Pharmacist involvement in immunization, whether as educators, facilitators, or administrators of vaccines, resulted in increased uptake of immunizations.

This systematic review (SR) summarizes available data on statistically relevant potential risk factors (PRFs) associated with human CE. Methodology/Principal Findings: Database searches identified 1,367 papers, of which thirty-seven were eligible for inclusion. Of these, eight and twenty-nine were case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Among the eligible papers, twenty-one were included in the meta-analyses. Pooled odds ratio (OR) were used as a measure of effect and separately analysed for the two study designs. PRFs derived from case-control studies that were significantly associated with higher odds of outcome were ¡§dog free to roam¡¨ (OR 5.23; 95% CI 2.45¡V11.14), ¡§feeding dogs with viscera¡¨ (OR 4.69; 95% CI 3.02¡V7.29), ¡§slaughter at home¡¨ (OR 4.67; 95% CI 2.02¡V10.78) or at ¡§slaughterhouses¡¨ (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.15¡V6.3), ¡§dog ownership¡¨ (OR 3.54; 95% CI 1.27¡V9.85), ¡§living in rural areas¡¨ (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.16¡V2.9) and ¡§low income¡¨ (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.02¡V2.76).

Methods: PubMed,Embase,and the Cochrane Library were searched systematically up to January 2016. All randomized controlled trials directly comparing the effectiveness of AR and IF for displaced intracapsular fracture were retrieved with no limitation on language or publication year. Results: In total,eight prospective randomized studies involving 2206 patients were included.

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a recognition molecule that mediates phagocytosis and activates complement. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the association of MBL-2 functional polymorphisms with HPV infection and cervical cancer (CC). Results: The meta-analyses indicated an association between the MBL2 exon 1 polymorphisms and susceptibility to HPV infection in the recessive model (OO vs. AA?+?AO, p?=?0.042, 95?% CI 1.02¡V3.15), and O/O vs. A/A mode (P?=?0.023, 95?% CI 1.10¡V3.40) in Caucasian.

Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research. Objective The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects. Data Sources Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included. Study Design A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction. Results Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89¡V1.27; I2, 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90¡V1.26; I2, 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34¡V3.50; I2, 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28¡V3.56; I2, 8%). Conclusion Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Identifying risk factors of SSI is an important point for preventive strategies to reduce the incidence of SSI. The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the most important risk factors for SSI after spinal surgery. Methods PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify cohort or case-control studies that investigated the risk factors for SSI following spinal surgery. A fixed-effects or random-effects model was used to pool the estimates, depending on the heterogeneity among the included studies. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed by I2 and Cochran's Q test. Results Twelve studies with a total of 13,476 patients met the inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. Of them, 1 was a nested case-control studies, 7 were case-control studies, and 4 were cohort studies. The most important predictors of SSI were diabetes (risk ratio [RR] = 2.22, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.38¡V3.60; P = 0.001), prolonged operative times (&gt;3 hours) (RR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.12¡V4.19; P = 0.009), body mass index more than 35 (RR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.47¡V3.80; P = 0.000), and posterior approach (RR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.05¡V1.41; P = 0.009). Conclusion Diabetes, prolonged operative times (&gt;3 hours), body mass index more than 35, posterior approach, and number of intervertebral levels (?7) are associated with an increased risk of SSI after spinal surgery. Almost all these risk factors are in line with the known risk factors for SSI in patients who underwent spinal surgery. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc."

These risks are derived from Asia; little is known about sub-Saharan Africa. Aim: To determine the risk of mother-to-child transmission in sub-Saharan Africa, according to maternal HBeAg and type of prophylaxis. Methods: We searched Medline, Global Health, Embase, African Journals Online and African Index Medicus. We included observational or interventional studies that enrolled infants of HBV-infected women, and that tested for HBsAg or HBV DNA between 3 and 12 months of age. Results: Fifteen articles from 11 African countries were included. Among HBeAg-positive women, the pooled risk was 38.3% (95% CI: 7.0¡V74.4%) without prophylaxis, which was significantly lower than the lower bound of 70¡V90% risk in the literature (P = 0.007). Among HBeAg-negative women, the pooled risk was 4.8% (95% CI: 0.1¡V13.3%) without prophylaxis, which lays within the lower range of the 5¡V30% risk in Asia. By extrapolating the pooled transmission risks to the number of births to infectious mothers, an estimated 1% of newborns (n = 367 250) are annually infected with HBV at birth in sub-Saharan Africa. Conclusions: Compared to Asia, the risk of mother-to-child transmission is low in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the annual number of infants perinatally infected with HBV is twice the number of incident paediatric HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa (n = 190 000). This highlights the importance of preventing mother-to-child transmission of HBV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has been long neglected. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

Electronic databases and the grey literature were searched up to May 2015. Clinical studies in humans evaluating the antimicrobial resistance of primary acute endodontic infection isolates were included. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A random-effect meta-analysis was employed. The outcome was described as the pooled resistance rates for each antimicrobial agent. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses were performed. Subgroup analyses were conducted based upon report or not of the use of antibiotics prior to sampling as an exclusion factor (subgroups A and B, respectively). Data from seven studies were extracted. Resistance rates for 15 different antimicrobial agents were evaluated (range, 3.5¡V40.0%). Lower resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and amoxicillin; higher resistance rates were detected for tetracycline. Resistance rates varied according to previous use of an antimicrobial agent as demonstrated by the subgroup analyses. Heterogeneity was observed for the resistance profiles of penicillin G in subgroup A and for amoxicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole and tetracycline in subgroup B. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that resistance rates changed for metronidazole, clindamycin, tetracycline and amoxicillin. These findings suggest that clinical isolates had low resistance to £]-lactams. Further well-designed studies are needed to clarify whether the differences in susceptibility among the antimicrobial agents may influence clinical responses to treatment. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy"

However, the extent of these cognitive impairments is unknown. Current literature does not document specific cognitive domains most affected in HIV-infected children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze the degree of cognitive impairment, and the specific cognitive domains affected, in children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV infection. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched 5 electronic bibliographic databases, namely: PubMed, PsychINFO, Academic Search Premier, Scopus, and WorldCat, by using a search protocol specifically designed for this study. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected on the basis of set a priori eligibility criteria. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were assessed by 2 independent reviewers. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from included studies were extracted into Microsoft Excel by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified for inclusion in the systematic review and of this, 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results from the meta-analysis indicated that working memory and executive function were the domains most affected by the HIV virus. LIMITATIONS: Only 27% of the included studies were suitable to enter into the meta-analysis. There was significant geographic bias in published studies, with only 32% (7/22) of included studies from sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence supports an association between HIV infection in children and adolescents and cognitive impairment in the domains of working memory, executive function and processing speed, with effect size estimates also providing some support for deficits in visual memory and visual-spatial ability.

However, few studies directly compare surgical outcomes following acellular dermal matrix-based reconstruction with two of the most commonly available materials, AlloDerm and FlexHD. Those studies that are available often do not adequately control for the surgeon as a variable. The authors hypothesize that complication rates will not differ significantly between AlloDerm and FlexHD when practice and surgeon variables are properly controlled. Methods: Retrospective review was conducted to identify consecutive implant-based reconstruction procedures performed at a tertiary academic medical institution by a single plastic surgeon over 6 years. Univariate and binomial regression analyses were conducted to compare patient characteristics and clinical endpoints across acellular dermal matrix groups (AlloDerm/AlloDerm ready-to-use versus FlexHD Pliable/Perforated). Results: Of the 233 patients that underwent matrix-based breast reconstruction, 11 (4.7 percent) developed surgical-site infection. The infection rate was not statistically different between patients who received FlexHD [n = 5 (5.0 percent)] versus AlloDerm [n = 6 (4.6 percent)] on either univariate (p = 0.89) or binomial regression analysis (p = 0.56). Likewise, there were no statistical differences in rates of seroma, hematoma, explantation, or delayed wound healing. Conclusions: Clinical endpoints of interest were all equivalent between acellular dermal matrix types. This study uniquely reports a single-surgeon case series comparing outcomes between different acellular dermal matrix types. Instead of focusing on acellular dermal matrix as a predictor of outcome, other patient and surgeon factors should be addressed to improve results and innovate better alternatives.

Fifteen studies solely described hernia repair with biologic mesh, 6 nonabsorbable synthetic meshes, and 11 described various techniques. Surgical site complications and hernia recurrence rates were evaluated per degree of contamination and mesh type by calculating pooled proportions. Conclusions Analysis showed no benefit of biologic over synthetic mesh for repair of potentially contaminated hernias with comparable surgical site complication rates and a hernia recurrence rate of 9% for biologic and 9% for synthetic repair. Biologic mesh repair of contaminated defects showed considerable higher rates of surgical site complications and a hernia recurrence rate of 30%.

Aim: To comprehensively compare the efficacy and safety of the SL and SLR regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infections. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched. Only RCTs that compared the efficacy and safety of SL or SLR regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 infection were included. The primary outcome measures were the sustained virological response weeks 12 (SVR12) post-treatment and adverse events (AEs). Results: Seven studies comprising 2601 patients were included. Compared with the SL regimen, SLR yielded a similar probability of having an SVR12 (RR 1.002, 95?% CI 0.998, 1.017, P?=?0.780). Based on subgroup analyses, the addition of RBV to the 8-week SL regimen improved the SVR12 rate. However, the SLR regimen for 12 or 24?weeks did not show a superior SVR12 rate regardless of treatment history and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. The pooled incidence of AEs was higher in patients that received the SLR treatment regimen (RR 1.140, 95?% CI 1.095, 1.187, P?=?0.000).

Results In the comparison meta-analysis, MOM showed higher revision rate than COC for any reason (odds ratio?= 2.39, P?=.046) and PJI (odds ratio?= 6.21, P?=.015). In the proportion meta-analysis, the MOM group showed significantly higher revision rate than COC group for any reason, aseptic loosening, and PJI. Conclusion MOM bearings were associated with a higher risk of revision for any reason and PJI than COC bearings after cementless total hip arthroplasty. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The procedure is associated with a wide range of complication rates. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature for papers describing complication rates following inguinal (ID) and ilioinguinal (I-ID) lymphadenectomies, and estimate the actual complication rates in patients with malignant melanoma. Methods: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies reporting complications following ID and I-ID for malignant melanomas. Results: A total of 416 records were identified, of which 20 were deemed eligible for this study. The complication rates (with 95% confidence intervals) were found to be as follows: overall complications = 52% (44¡V60%); lymphorrea = 29% (0¡V71%); seroma = 23% (18¡V29%); infection = 21% (15¡V27%); wound breakdown =14% (8¡V21%); skin edge necrosis = 10% (6¡V15%); haematoma = 3% (1¡V5%); and lymphoedema = 33% (25¡V42%).

Donors have to be well educated about all risks and details during the informed consent process. For this to be successful, more information regarding short-term outcome is necessary. Methods A literature search was performed; all studies discussing short-term complications after minimally invasive live donor nephrectomy were included. Outcomes evaluated were intraoperative and postoperative complications, conversions, operative and warm ischemia times, blood loss, length of hospital stay, pain score, convalescence, quality of life, and costs. Results One hundred ninety articles were included in the systematic review, 41 in the meta-analysis. Conversion rate was 1.1%. Intraoperative complication rate was 2.3%, mainly bleeding (1.5%). Postoperative complications occurred in 7.3% of donors, including infectious complications (2.6%), of which mainly wound infection (1.6%) and bleeding (1.0%). Reported mortality rate was 0.01%. All minimally invasive techniques were comparable with regard to complication or conversion rate. Conclusions The used techniques for minimally invasive live donor nephrectomy are safe and associated with low complication rates and minimal risk of mortality. These data may be helpful to develop a standardized, donor-tailored informed consent procedure for live donor nephrectomy. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between timing of cranioplasty and related complications. A systematic search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane databases was performed using PRISMA guidelines for English-language articles published between 1990 and 2015. Case series, case¡Vcontrol and cohort studies, and clinical trials reporting timing and complication data for cranioplasty after decompressive craniectomy in adults were included. Extracted data included overall complications, infections, reoperations, intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collections, hydrocephalus, seizures, and bone resorption for cranioplasty performed within (early) and beyond (late) 90 days. Twenty-five of 321 articles met inclusion criteria for a total of 3126 patients (1421 early vs. 1705 late). All were retrospective observational studies. Early cranioplasty had significantly higher odds of hydrocephalus than late cranioplasty (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.38, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.25¡V4.52, p = 0.008). There was no difference in odds of overall complications, infections, reoperations, intracranial hemorrhage, extra-axial fluid collections, seizures, or bone resorption. Subgroup analysis of trauma patients revealed a decreased odds of extra-axial fluid collection (OR 0.30, p = 0.02) and an increased odds of hydrocephalus (OR 4.99, p = 0.05). Early cranioplasty within 90 days after decompressive craniectomy is associated with an increased odds of hydrocephalus than with later cranioplasty, but no difference in odds of developing other complications. Earlier cranioplasty in the trauma population is associated with fewer extra-axial fluid collections. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd"

Unfortunately, available data on this association are contrasting. A systematic review and meta-analysis of literature studies was performed to evaluate the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with HCV. Studies reporting on VTE risk associated with HCV were systematically searched in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and EMBASE databases. Six studies (10 data-sets) showed a significantly increased VTE risk in 100,364 HCV patients as compared with 8,471,176 uninfected controls (odds ratio [OR]: 1.900; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.406, 2.570; p<0.0001). These results were confirmed when specifically considering the risk of DVT (6 studies, OR: 1.918; 95 %CI: 1.351, 2.723; p<0.0001), whereas a trend towards an increased risk of PE was documented in HCV patients (4 studies, OR: 1.811; 95 %CI: 0.895, 3.663; p=0.099). The increased VTE risk associated with HCV infection was consistently confirmed when analysing four studies reporting adjusted risk estimates (OR: 1.876; 95 %CI: 1.326, 2.654; P<0.0001), and after excluding studies specifically enrolling populations exposed to transient risk factors for VTE (4 studies, OR: 1.493; 95 %CI: 1.167, 1.910; p=0.001). Meta-regression models suggested that age and male gender may significantly impact on the risk of VTE associated with HCV-positivity. Results of our metaanalysis suggest that HCV-infected subjects may exhibit an increased risk of VTE. However, further high quality studies are needed to extend and confirm our findings. ?

The operation can be performed with minimally invasive surgery or as an open procedure. A further development in the minimally invasive appendicectomy technique has been the introduction of single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILA). Aim To ascertain any differences in outcomes from available trials comparing SILA with conventional multi-incision laparoscopic appendicectomy (CLA). Methods A literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE/Ovid and CENTRAL for articles from Jan1990 to June 2015 with key words: ¡¥appendectomy¡¦, ¡¥appendicetomy¡¦ ¡¥appendicitis¡¦ ¡¥laparoscopy¡¦ ¡¥keyhole¡¦ ¡¥single port¡¦ ¡¥single incision¡¦ ¡¥single site¡¦ ¡¥one port¡¦ ¡¥incisionless¡¦ ¡¥scarless¡¦. Randomised control trials of patients with signs and symptoms of appendicitis undergoing laparoscopic appendicectomy, with one arm being SILA were included. Statistical analysis was performed through Mantle-Haenszel and inverse variance methods. Results A total of 8 RCTs published between 2012 and 2014 with a total of 995 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed no significant differences between SILA and CLA for complication rates, post-operative ileus, length of hospital stay, return to work or post-operative pain. CLA was significantly superior to SILA with reduced operating time (mean difference 5.81 [2.01, 9.62] P?=?0.003) and conversion rates (OR 4.14 [1.93, 8.91] P?=?0.0003). SILA surgery had better wound cosmesis (mean difference 0.55 [0.33, 0.77] P?=?0.00001). Conclusion SILA is comparable to CLA in terms of complications, post-operative pain and recovery. Therefore, SILA could be a viable option in the hands of an experienced surgeons and for patients¡¦ groups who place great value on the final cosmetic outcome. ? 2016"

This meta-analysis aimed to examine whether SILC shows real benefits over MLC, especially in terms of feasibility, safety, and oncological adequacy. Methods: A literature review of studies comparing SILC and MLC has been performed which looked at the following outcomes: mortality, morbidity, and oncological parameters of adequacy, as well as other potential benefits and drawbacks. Standardized mean difference for continuous variables and odds ratios for qualitative variables were calculated. Results: Thirty studies comparing SILC and MLC were reviewed: two prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs), eight prospective studies, and 20 retrospective comparative observational studies. Overall, in a cohort of 3502 patients who underwent surgery, SILC was used in 1068 cases (30.5?%) and MLC was used in 2434 cases (69.5?%). Mean intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower when the SILC procedure had been used (75.06 vs. 91.45?ml, P?=?0.03); bowel function recovered significantly earlier in the SILC patients (1.96 vs. 2.15?days, P?=?0.03); mean postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the SILC group (5.55 vs. 6.60?days, P?=?0.0005); and length of skin incision was significantly shorter in SILC patients (3.98 vs. 5.28?cm, P?=?0.01). However, in the latter four outcomes, evidence of heterogeneity was found. In contrast, MLC showed significantly better results when compared to SILC in terms of distal free margins (12.26 vs. 10.98?cm, P?=?0.01). Conclusions: SILC could be considered as a safe and feasible alternative to MLC in experienced hands. Further evidence for this surgical procedure should be assessed in the form of high-quality RCTs, with additional focus on its use in low rectal cancer resection. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

In most patients, an IgG autoantibody binding to astrocytic aquaporin 4, the principal water channel of the central nervous system, is detected. Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 B-lymphocyte surface antigen, has been increasingly adopted as a first-line off-label treatment for patients with NMOSDs. OBJECTIVE To perform a systematic review and ameta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of rituximab use in NMOSDs, considering the potential predictive factors related to patient response to rituximab in this disease. EVIDENCE REVIEW English-language studies published between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2015, were searched in the MEDLINE, Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and clinicaltrials.gov databases. Patient characteristics, outcome measures, treatment regimens, and recorded adverse effects were extracted. FINDINGS Forty-six studies were included in the systematic review. Twenty-five studies that included 2 or more patients with NMOSDs treated with rituximab were included in the meta-analysis. Differences in the annualized relapse rate ratio and Expanded Disability Status Scale score before and after rituximab therapy were the main efficacy measures. Safety outcomes included the proportion of deaths, withdrawals because of toxic effects, and adverse effects. RESULTS Among 46 studies involving 438 patients (381 female and 56 male [sex was not specified in 1 patient]; mean age at the outset of treatment, 32 years [age range, 2-77 years]), rituximab therapy resulted in a mean (SE) 0.79 (0.15) (95%CI, -1.08 to -0.49) reduction in the mean annualized relapse rate ratio and a mean (SE) 0.64 (0.27) (95%CI, -1.18 to -0.10) reduction in the mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score. A significant correlation was observed between disease duration and the Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Adverse effects were recorded in 114 of 438 (26%) patients treated with rituximab. Specifically, 45 patients (10.3%) experienced infusion-related adverse effects, 40 patients (9.1%) had an infection, 20 patients (4.6%) developed persistent leukopenia, 2 patients (0.5%) were diagnosed as having posterior reversible encephalopathy, and 7 patients (1.6%) died. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that rituximab therapy reduces the frequency of NMOSD relapses and neurological disability in patients with NMOSDs. However, the safety profile suggests caution in prescribing rituximab as a first-line therapy. Copyright 2016 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

Methods: Peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and December 2014 were identified using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Thirty-two studies involving 26,869 persons were included in the systematic review; 13 studies involving 7,785 persons were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: Reflecting the sociodemographics of the military, those who are younger, single, not living with family, have fewer years of work experience, lower education, and lower income are at increased risk for psychological distress, alcohol/drug misuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety as a result of their perceived risk of infection. Effect sizes for post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive, and anxiety symptoms were considered small (SMD = 0.12, 95% CI = -0.23 to 0.47), moderate (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.24-0.51), and small (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.25), respectively; however, only the effect size for depressive symptoms was statistically significant. Conclusions: Deployed service members may return with clinically significant problems, the most notable of which is depression. Delivering resilience training and fostering altruistic acceptance may protect service members from developing mental health disorders. copy; Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. ?

The relationship between MGMT promoter methylation and gastric cancer (GC) remains inconsistent. This study aimed to evaluate the potential value of MGMT promoter methylation in GC patients. Electronic databases were searched to identify eligible studies. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to evaluate the effects of MGMT methylation on GC risk and clinicopathological characteristics. In total, 31 eligible studies including 2988 GC patients and 2189 nonmalignant controls were involved in metaanalysis. In the pooled analysis, MGMT promoter methylation was significantly associated with GC risk (OR = 3.34, P > 0.001) and substantial heterogeneity (P > 0.001). Meta-regression and subgroup analyses based on the testing method, sample material and ethnicity failed to explain the sources of heterogeneity. Interestingly, MGMT methylation showed a trend associated with gender, and methylation is lower in males compared with females (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.56-1.03). We did not find a significant association in relation to tumor types, clinical stage, age status or H. pylori status in cancer (all P < 0.1). MGMT promoter methylation may be correlated with the prognosis of GCs in disease free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) for univariate analysis. MGMT promoter methylation may play a crucial role in the carcinogenesis and prognosis of GC. MGMT methylation was not correlated with tumor types, clinical stage, age status, H. pylori status. However, the result of the association of MGMT methylation and gender should be considered with caution. ? 2016 Ding et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

There are no significant differences between cartilage grafts and temporalis fascia grafts for hearing outcomes. Contrary to the sliced cartilage sub-group, full-thickness cartilage grafts generate better hearing outcomes than temporalis fascia grafts. Objective: Tympanic membrane perforation can cause middle ear relapsing infection and lead to hearing damage. Various techniques have been applied in order to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. Recently, cartilage grafts and temporalis fascia grafts have been widely used for tympanic membrane closure. A systemic review and meta-analysis was carried out based on published retrospective trials that investigated the efficacy of cartilage grafts and temporalis fascia grafts in type 1 tympanoplasty. Both graft take rates and mean AIR-BONE-GAP gains were analyzed. Methods: Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase were systematically searched. After a scientific investigation, we extracted the relevant data following our selection criteria. Odds ratio (OR) of graft take rates and mean difference (MD) of AIR-BONE-GAP gains were calculated within 95% confidence intervals. Results: Eight eligible articles with 915 patients were reviewed. The pooled OR for graft take rate was 3.11 (95% CI =1.94¡V5.00; p = 0.43) and the difference between the two groups was significant, which means that the cartilage grafts group got a better graft take rate than the temporalis fascia grafts group. The pooled MD for mean AIR-BONE-GAP gain was 1.92 (95% CI = ?0.12¡V3.95; p < 0.000 01) and the difference was not significant. However, in the full thickness cartilage grafts sub-group, the pooled MD for mean AIR-BONE-GAP gains was 2.56 (95% CI =1.02¡V4.10; p = 0.14) and the difference was significant, which means that the full thickness cartilage grafts sub-group got a better hearing outcome than the temporalis fascia grafts group. On the contrary, the pooled MD of sliced cartilage grafts sub-group was 0.12 (95% CI = ?0.44¡V0.69; p = 0.61) and there was no significant difference between the sliced cartilage grafts and temporalis fascia group. ? 2016 Acta Oto-Laryngologica AB (Ltd)."

We aim to compare the efficiency and safety of PCNL with LSS, as far as the management of large upper urinary stones is concerned. A systematic search from Pubmed, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Elsevier was performed up to August 1, 2015 for the relevant published studies. After data extraction and quality assessment, meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5.3 software. 15 eligible trials evaluating LSS vs. PCNL were identified including 6 prospective and 9 retrospective studies with 473 patients undergoing LSS and 523 patients undergoing PCNL. Although LSS led to longer operative time (p?=?0.01) and higher open conversion rate (p?=?0.02), patients might benefit from significantly fewer overall complications (p?=?0.03), especially lower bleeding rate (p?=?0.02), smaller drop in hemoglobin level (p?<?0.001), less need of blood transfusion (p?=?0.01). The stone free rate was also higher for LSS compared with PCNL (p?<?0.001) with less secondary/complementary procedure (p?=?0.006). There was no significant difference in other demographic parameters between the two groups. Our data suggests that LSS turns out to be a safe and feasible alternative to PCNL for large upper urinary stones with less bleeding and higher stone free rate. Because of the inherent limitations of the included studies, further large sample prospective, multi-centric studies and randomized control trials should be undertaken to confirm our findings. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

There is uncertainty regarding which factors are associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with pulmonary TB. This knowledge gap complicates efforts to identify and improve the management of those individuals with TB at greatest risk of death. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to establish predictors of in-hospital mortality among patients with pulmonary TB to enhance the evidence base for public policy. Methods and analysis Studies will be identified by a MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health search. Eligible studies will be cohort and case-control studies that report predictors or risk factors for in-hospital mortality among patients with pulmonary TB and an adjusted analysis to explore factors associated with in-hospital mortality. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to summarise the findings of some reported predictors. Teams of 2 reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts of all citations identified in our search, independently and in duplicate, extract data, and assess scientific quality using standardised forms quality assessment and tools tailored. We will pool all factors that were assessed for an association with mortality that were reported by >1 study, and presented the OR and the associated 95% CI. When studies provided the measure of association as a relative risk (RR), we will convert the RR to OR using the formula provided by Wang. For binary data, we will calculate a pooled OR, with an associated 95% CI. Ethics and dissemination This study is based on published data, and therefore ethical approval is not a requirement.

Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umeclidinium plus vilanterol, in contrast to either monotherapy or placebo. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM). Randomized clinical trials pertaining to the treatment of COPD with the combination of umeclidinium and vilanterol, versus umeclidinium, vilanterol or placebo, were reviewed. Studies were pooled to mean differences (MDs), with 95?% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Six studies were included in our meta-analysis. The application of umeclidinium plus vilanterol compared with umeclidinium alone showed increases in trough forced expiratory volume in 1?s [FEV1] (MD 0.05?L, 95?% CI 0.04¡V0.07; p?&lt;?0.00001) and forced vital capacity [FVC] (MD 0.07?L, 95?% CI 0.04¡V0.10; p?&lt;?0.00001). Similarly, versus vilanterol alone, the application of umeclidinium plus vilanterol showed increases in trough FEV1 (MD 0.10, 95?% CI 0.08¡V0.12; p?&lt;?0.00001) and FVC (MD 0.16?L, 95?% CI 0.13¡V0.20; p?&lt;?0.00001). Compared with placebo, umeclidinium plus vilanterol also showed increases in trough FEV1 (MD 0.21?L, 95?% CI 0.19¡V0.22; p?&lt;?0.00001) and FVC (MD 0.31?L, 95?% CI 0.26¡V0.35; p?&lt;?0.00001).

Conclusions: Compared with the other three groups, i.e. placebo, umeclidinium and vilanterol, umeclidinium plus vilanterol improves lung function and quality of life in patients with COPD, reduces the use of albuterol, and does not increase the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."
1036,"Huang J., Wang X., Chen X., Song Q., Liu W., Lu L.",Perioperative antibiotics to prevent acute endophthalmitis after ophthalmic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0166141,27824933,"Background Post-operative endophthalmitis is a rare and dreaded complication in ophthalmic operations because it often induces irreparable vision loss. Although many ophthalmological studies aimed at reducing the rate of endophthalmitis have been performed around the world, controversy continues to surround some issues, including the choice of antimicrobials and their route of administration, duration and timing. The aim of this study is to investigate some of these unresolved issues. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies was performed. The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Clinical Trials databases were searched to identify studies published until Feb. 2016. The relative risk (RR) for each clinical outcome data is presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Pooled estimates of effects were calculated using random-effect models. Results Thirty-four studies from twenty-four reports involving 1264797 eyes were included in this analysis. Endophthalmitis occurred, on average, in one out of 6177 eyes when intracameral vancomycin/moxifloxacin were used and in one out of 1517 eyes when intracameral vancomycin/moxifloxacin were not used. The relative risk (95% CI) of endophthalmitis was reduced to 0.20 (0.10, 0.42) when intracameral antibiotics were used (p<0.0001). The subconjunctival injection of antibiotics was not superior to other administration routes included in this study (RR = 1.67, 95% CI (0.55, 5.05), p = 0.36). A statistically significant difference was found in the rate of endophthalmitis between the use and lack of use of topical antibiotics (RR = 0.65, 95% CI (0.43, 0.99), p = 0.04). However, no statistically significant difference was found in microbial isolation rates between these groups (RR = 0.77, 95% CI (0.34, 1.75), p = 0.53). When long-term and short-term use of topical antibiotics before surgery were compared, a statistically significant difference was found in microbial isolation rates (RR = 0.57, 95% CI (0.44, 0.74), p<0.0001). Conclusions This meta-analysis concluded intracameral antibiotics are effective at preventing endophthalmitis in ocular surgery. A randomized controlled trial confirms the efficacy of cefuroxime but recent large cohort studies support the efficacy of vancomycin/moxifloxacin intracamerally. Intracameral antibitoics are superior to subconjunctival injections but that irrigation antibitoic data are not of enough quality to make a comparison. Different results were found in two clinical outcomes between the use or lack of use of topical antibiotic therapy, we did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that its use prevents endophthalmitis. ? 2016 Huang et al.

Platelet transfusions have limited efficacy in this setting and alternative agents that could replace, or reduce platelet transfusion, and are effective at reducing bleeding are needed. Objectives: To compare the relative efficacy of different interventions for patients with thrombocytopenia due to chronic bone marrow failure and to derive a hierarchy of potential alternative treatments to platelet transfusions. Search methods: We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), CINAHL (from 1937), the Transfusion Evidence Library (from 1980) and ongoing trial databases to 27 April 2016. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials in people with thrombocytopenia due to chronic bone marrow failure who were allocated to either an alternative to platelet transfusion (artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa), desmopressin (DDAVP), recombinant factor XIII (rFXIII), recombinant interleukin (rIL)6 or rIL11, or thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics) or a comparator (placebo, standard of care or platelet transfusion). We excluded people undergoing intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transfusion. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We estimated summary risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We planned to use summary mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. All summary measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We could not perform a network meta-analysis because the included studies had important differences in the baseline severity of disease for the participants and in the number of participants undergoing chemotherapy. This raised important concerns about the plausibility of the transitivity assumption in the final dataset and we could not evaluate transitivity statistically because of the small number of trials per comparison. Therefore, we could only perform direct pairwise meta-analyses of included interventions. We employed a random-effects model for all analyses. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic and its 95% CI. The risk of bias of each study included was assessed using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE methods. Main results: We identified seven completed trials (472 participants), and four ongoing trials (recruiting 837 participants) which are due to be completed by December 2020. Of the seven completed trials, five trials (456 participants) compared a TPO mimetic versus placebo (four romiplostim trials, and one eltrombopag trial), one trial (eight participants) compared DDAVP with placebo and one trial (eight participants) compared tranexamic acid with placebo. In the DDAVP trial, the only outcome reported was the bleeding time. In the tranexamic acid trial there were methodological flaws and bleeding definitions were subject to significant bias. Consequently, these trials could not be incorporated into the quantitative synthesis. No randomised trial of artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, rFVIIa, rFXIII, rIL6 or rIL11 was identified. We assessed all five trials of TPO mimetics included in this review to be at high risk of bias because the trials were funded by the manufacturers of the TPO mimetics and the authors had financial stakes in the sponsoring companies. The GRADE quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across the different outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the number of participants with at least one bleeding episode between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.31, four trials, 206 participants, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the risk of a life-threatening bleed between those treated with a TPO mimetic and placebo (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.26, one trial, 39 participants, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the risk of all-cause mortality between those treated with a TPO mimetic and placebo (RR 0.74, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.05, five trials, 456 participants, very low-quality evidence). There was a significant reduction in the number of participants receiving any platelet transfusion between those treated with TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95, four trials, 206 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in the incidence of transfusion reactions between those treated with TPO mimetics and placebo (pOR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 3.44, one trial, 98 participants, very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in thromboembolic events between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 1.41, 95%CI 0.39 to 5.01, five trials, 456 participants, very-low quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in drug reactions between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.51, five trials, 455 participants, low-quality evidence). No trial reported the number of days of bleeding per participant, platelet transfusion episodes, mean red cell transfusions per participant, red cell transfusion episodes, transfusion-transmitted infections, formation of antiplatelet antibodies or platelet refractoriness. In order to demonstrate a reduction in bleeding events from 26 in 100 to 16 in 100 participants, a study would need to recruit 514 participants (80% power, 5% significance). Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence at present for thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for the prevention of bleeding for people with thrombocytopenia due to chronic bone marrow failure. There is no randomised controlled trial evidence for artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, rFVIIa, rFXIII or rIL6 or rIL11, antifibrinolytics or DDAVP in this setting. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We aimed to analyse the features at presentation, therapeutic approaches and the disease course of these rare diseases. Methods: Electronic searches of Medline and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials database were conducted. We also checked the reference lists of the studies included and other systematic reviews, to identify additional reports. We included all cohorts, cross-sectional studies or registries reporting features at presentation or outcomes in patients with a diagnosis of childhood-onset GPA or MPA (age <18 years). The pooled prevalence of clinical manifestations at presentation, ANCA and induction therapies for GPA and MPA was calculated. Results: We reviewed 570 full texts and identified 14 studies on GPA and 8 on MPA. Childhood-onset GPA and MPA occurred predominantly in female subjects during adolescence. For GPA, ear-nose-throat (ENT) disease (pooled prevalence 82 % [95 % CI 78-87]), constitutional symptoms (73 % [95 % CI 55-88]), renal (65 % [95 % CI 49-79]), and lower respiratory tract (61 % [95 % CI 48-74]) manifestations were the most frequently reported at presentation. Renal disease was a hallmark of MPA (94 % [95 % CI 89-97]). ANCA were detected in >90 % of children with GPA or MPA. Combined corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide was the most frequently used first remission-inducing treatment for GPA (76 % [95 % CI 69-82]) and MPA (62 % [95 % CI 20-96]). Relapses occurred more frequently in GPA (67-100 %) than in MPA (25-50 %). The leading causes of death were the disease itself, and infections. Conclusions: Childhood-onset MPA and GPA remain severe diseases with frequent relapses and a high cumulative morbidity. Survival and disease-free survival need to be improved. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

These infections may have similar effect in other inflammatory processes, such as insulin resistance. This review aims to examine the literature on the effect of helminthic infections on metabolic outcomes in humans. Methods Using the PRISMA protocol, we searched the literature using PubMed, MEDLINE, and a manual review of reference lists. Human studies published in English after 1995 were included. Four papers were included in this review. Data was extracted and a meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Tau2 and I2 tests. Results The included studies found that infection was associated with lower glucose levels, less insulin resistance, and/or a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Meta-analysis showed that participants with a previous or current helminth infection were 50% less likely to have an endpoint of metabolic dysfunction in comparison to uninfected participants (OR 0.50; 95% CI 0.38¡V0.66). Conclusion This review has shown that helminth infections can be associated with improved metabolic outcomes.

This review will inform updating the WHO 2003 guidelines on Vaginal Discharge syndromic case management. Methods: A systematic review was conducted on published studies from 01-01-2000 to 30-03-2015 in multiple databases. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy and validation of the WHO Vaginal Discharge Flowchart were included. Validation parameters including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and the 95% confidence intervals for the different types of the flowchart were taken as outcomes, re-calculated, and analysed using a fixed model meta-analysis for data pooling. The level of agreement between the index and reference test were determined by the Cohen's Kappa co-efficiency test. Each individual study was assessed on quality using the QUADAS-2 tool. Findings: The search yielded 2,845 studies of which 16 met the eligibility criteria for final analysis. The diagnostic performance to identify cervical infections was low and resulted in a high proportion of over and missed treatment. The four flowcharts had a sensitivity between 27.37% in history and risk assessment and 90.13% with microscopy, with the inverse in specificity rates. The treatment performances between the flowcharts were inconsistent. The same applies to the use of vaginal discharge flowchart for treating vaginal infections. For vaginal infections the vaginal discharge flowchart had a good performance in flowchart 3 with 91.68% of sensitivity; 99.97% specificity; 99.93% PPV and 0.02% who missed their treatment and 8.32% of women who were over treated by the vaginal discharge flowchart Conclusion: The vaginal discharge flowchart should focus on management of vaginal infection. It could be used as an intermediate approach for cervical infections for sex workers until a point of care test is available in resource poor settings. ? 2016 Zemouri et al.

However, the reported prevalence rates have been inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted to provide updates on the prevalence of HCV infection in the DRC. Study design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Medline, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for publications reporting on HCV infection in the DRC up to autumn 2015. In addition, a manual search was undertaken to detect relevant papers. Studies performed in groups at low risk of HCV (blood donors and pregnant women) were used for the meta-analysis. The random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of anti-HCV. Results Sixteen studies with 13,799 participants (aged 6 months¡V71 years) met the inclusion criteria. The studies were performed in blood donors, pregnant women, military personnel, individuals with human immunodeficiency virus, children, commercial sex workers, Congolese patients living in Canada, patients with sickle cell disease and hospitalized patients. The reviewed studies revealed the presence of anti-HCV in almost all studied age groups and did not differ between sexes. The pooled prevalence of anti-HCV was 2.9% [95% confidence interval 1.5¡V4.3%]. Subgroup analyses revealed that the prevalence rates of anti-HCV in blood donors and pregnant women were 2.7% (95% confidence interval: 1.1¡V4.4%) and 3.3% (1.4¡V5.1%), respectively.

The introduction of intramedullary stems for additional stability in revision is well accepted by most of the surgeons, while the philosophy of stem fixation is still under controversy. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the survivorship of revised implants with regard to a cemented or cementless stem fixation. Methods: Publications with patients who underwent revision TKA with minimum 24-month follow-up were systematically reviewed. Type of intramedullary stem fixation, failure rate for any reason, incidence of aseptic loosening and infection were extracted with follow-up interval specified. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to aggregate incidence data, which was compared between different fixation groups by fitting of logistic regression model. Results: Seventeen observational studies were included in this meta-analysis. There was a similar likelihood of failure for any reason (risk ratio, RR 0.97), general reoperation (RR 1.02), aseptic loosening (RR 1.0) and infection (RR 1.0) in cemented stem fixation group compared to cementless stem fixation group with follow-up <60?months.

There was no significant difference in any of these comparisons of survival-related indices. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in failure for any reason, reoperation, aseptic loosening and infection between revision TKA with cemented or cementless stem fixation. Based on the available literature, no superiority of any type of stem fixation was found. If follow-up period was neglected, aseptic loosening would be the leading reason for pain and dysfunction of patient undertaken revision TKA.

Our objective was to perform a comprehensive review of the literature and conduct a meta-analysis to compare outcomes of laparoscopy and laparotomy in PAT. Methods In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement standards, we conducted a systematic search of electronic information sources, including MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry; ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN Register, and bibliographic reference lists. We applied a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary search adapted to thesaurus headings, search operators and limits in each of the above databases. Missed injury, mortality, and complications were defined as the primary outcome parameters. Procedure time, length of hospital stay, sensitivity and specificity of the procedure were the secondary outcomes. Combined overall effect sizes were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects models. Results We identified one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and 8 observational studies comparing outcomes of laparoscopy with laparotomy in PAT. Laparoscopy was associated with a significantly lower risk of wound infection (Odd ratio (OR): 0.55; 95% Confidence interval (CI), 0.37¡V0.81, P?=?0.003) and pneumonia (OR: 0.22; 95% CI, 0.13¡V0.37, P?<?0.00001), and a significantly shorter length of hospital stay (Mean difference (MD):??3.05; 95% CI,??4.68 to??1.42, P?=?0.0002) and procedure time (MD:??27.99; 95% CI,??43.17 to??12.80, P?=?0.0003) compared with laparotomy. Laparoscopy was 100% sensitive in most of the included studies and avoided non-therapeutic laparotomies in 45.6% of patients. Conclusions Our analysis of best available evidence mainly from heterogeneous observational studies has demonstrated that laparoscopic evaluation of haemodynamically stable patients with PAT may be safe and can reduce post-operative complications and length of hospital stay. The most important advantage of laparoscopy is avoidance of non-therapeutic laparotomies which are associated with considerable morbidity. However, no definitive conclusion can be made regarding the therapeutic role of laparoscopy in PAT based on the available evidence and future research is indeed required. ? 2016"

Various risk factors have been studied but they remain inconclusive. We conducted the first ever systematic review and meta-analysis to look for the association between microtia and various environmental risk factors. Methods: Relevant case-control studies published between January 2000 to October 2014 were identified through a systematic search in PubMed and EMBASE. Reference lists from relevant review articles were also searched. Studies were included if they meet our selection criteria. Out of 1706 potential articles, 12 were included in the systematic review and 8 in the meta-analysis. Results: Risk factors which showed significant positive association with microtia were: cold-like syndrome during pregnancy (OR = 2.15; 95?% CI = 1.36, 3.41, P = 0.001); multiple gestation (OR = 1.55; 95?% CI = 1.05, 2.29, P = 0.03); and gestational diabetes (OR = 1.48; 95?% CI = 1.04, 2.10, P = 0.03). Risk factors which showed positive association but statistically insignificant were: threatened abortion (OR = 1.22; 95?% CI = 0.69, 2.15, P = 0.50); smoking during pregnancy (OR = 1.05; 95?% CI = 0.63, 1.77, P = 0.84); alcohol during pregnancy (OR = 1.08; 95?% CI = 0.65,1.80 P = 0.77); urinary tract infection (OR = 1.04; 95?% CI = 0.59, 1.84, P = 0.89); essential hypertension (OR = 1.04; 95?% CI = 0.74, 1.47, P = 0.82); maternal diabetes (OR = 3.98; 95?% CI = 0.72, 21.96, P = 0.11); respiratory tract infection (OR = 1.26,95?% CI = 0.84,1.88, P = 0.26); chronic disease during pregnancy (OR = 1.29,95?% CI = 0.99,1.69, P = 0.06); severe nausea/vomiting (OR = 1.16; 95?% CI = 0.66, 2.04, P = 0.61); NSAIDs during pregnancy (OR = 1.17, 95?% CI = 0.61,2.22, P = 0.64); antihypertensives during pregnancy (OR = 1.84,95?% CI = 0.94,3.62, P = 0.08); and illegal drugs during pregnancy (OR = 1.69; 95?% CI = 0.65, 4.39, P = 0.28). Reduced risk for microtia was found with these factors: folic acid (OR = 0.55; 95?% CI = 0.33, 0.92, P = 0.02); advanced maternal age (OR = 0.94; 95?% CI = 0.79, 1.11, P = 0.45); ampicillin during pregnancy (OR = 0.80,95?% CI = 0.50, 1.28, P = 0.35); and metronidazole during pregnancy (OR = 0.77,95?% CI = 0.40, 1.48 P = 0.44). Conclusions: Our study indicates cold-like syndrome, multiple gestation, and gestational diabetes as significant risk factors for microtia; whereas folic acid consumption during pregnancy is shown to be a protective factor. Studies on risk factors for microtia are still very limited to establish the definitive risk factors. Further large-scale and multicentre studies are needed to clarify the role of key risk factors for the development of microtia.

Clinicians across many disciplines need to counsel patients regarding surgical choices. Objectives: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the mortality and complication rates following surgery for diverticulitis in both the emergent and elective setting. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for relevant articles published from 1980 to 2012. The primary outcome of interest was the point estimate of mortality, following surgery for diverticulitis. Results: Of the 289 citations reviewed, we included 59 studies. Overall, the point estimate for mortality was 3.05%, with a 95% confidence intereval (CI) of 1.73¡V5.32 and p &lt; 0.001. Mortality following emergent surgery was 10.64% (95% CI 7.95¡V14.11; p &lt; 0.001), versus 0.50% (95% CI 0.46¡V0.54; p &lt; 0.001) following elective operations. A laparoscopic approach had an estimated mortality of 0.75% (95% CI 0.35¡V1.58; p &lt; 0.001), compared to an open surgical approach, which had a mortality of 4.69% (95% CI 2.29¡V9.36, p &lt; 0.001). The mortality following a resection with primary anastomosis was 1.96% (95% CI 1.22¡V3.13; p &lt; 0.001) and for the Hartmann¡¦s procedure was 14.18% (95% CI 9.83¡V20.03; p &lt; 0.001). A comparative analysis found that the risk of post-operative mortality was significantly higher following emergent surgery, compared to elective surgery (odds ratio (OR): 6.12 with 95% CI 1.62¡V23.10; p = 0.008; Q = 2.56, p = 0.46 and I2= 0); the open approach, compared to a laparoscopic approach (OR: 36.43 with 95% CI 9.94¡V133.6; p = 0.13; and Q = 2.79, p = 0.25 and I2= 28.26); and for Hartmann¡¦s procedure, compared to primary anastomosis without diversion (OR: 25.45 with 95% CI 15.13¡V42.81, p &lt; 0.001; and Q = 23.34, p = 0.14 and I2= 27.16). The overall reported post-operative complication rate was 32.64% (95% CI 27.43¡V38.32; p &lt; 0.00). The overall surgical and medical complication rates were 18.96% and 13.93%, respectively. Conclusions: Urgent surgical treatment of diverticulitis has a significant complication rate. Even elective surgery has a significant complication rate that needs to be considered when doing the clinical decision-making for recurrent diverticulitis. ? 2015, ? Author(s) 2015."

Methods: PubMed, Embase, Medline, CNKI, Wanfang database and Chinese VIP information were searched to identify the randomized and prospective comparative clinical studies which concern the treatment of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures (AO/OTA type C or Schatzker type V and VI) both with SP and DP fixation before October 1, 2015. STATA version 11.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) was used for data-analysis after the critical assessment of the methodological quality of the trials. Results: Finally, nine trials comprising 559 patients were included for this meta-analysis after the filtration. There were no significant differences between SP fixation and DP fixation with regards to outcomes for bone graft, post-operative malalignment and post-operative malreduciton in surgical details; infection, venous thrombosis, implant irritation and loss of reduction in complications; knee motion range in final outcomes. Lower surgical time, hospital stay, union time and incision necrosis were found in SP fixation compared with DP fixation. High rate of loss of alignment and more satisfaction with 12-month HSS score were associated with SP fixation than with DP fixation. Conclusions: Both SP fixation and DP fixation are acceptable strategies for managing this type of fracture. However, more high quality RCTs with large number of patients and long-term clinical evaluations are required to determine the optimal strategy for bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. ? 2016, SICOT aisbl."

Twenty-two high burden countries contributed to the majority of worldwide tuberculosis cases in 2015. Health care workers are at high risk of acquiring tuberculosis through occupational exposure. Objective To estimate the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among health care workers in high burden countries. Methods Databases including MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), CINAHL (Ovid) and ISI Web of Science (Thompson-Reuters), and grey literature were searched for English language records on relevant medical subject headings (MeSH) terms of LTBI and health care providers. Literature was systematically reviewed using EPPI-Reviewer4 software. Prevalence and incidence of LTBI and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Pooled prevalence of LTBI and 95% CI were calculated using random-effects meta-analysis models and heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. Sub-group analysis was conducted to assess the cause of heterogeneity. Results A total of 990 records were identified. Of those, 18 studies from only 7 high burden countries representing 10,078 subjects were included. Tuberculin skin test results were available for 9,545 participants. The pooled prevalence of LTBI was 47% (95% CI 34% to 60%, I2 = 99.6%). In subgroup analyses according to the country of the study, the pooled prevalence of LTBI was lowest in Brazil (37%) and highest in South Africa (64%). The pooled prevalence of LTBI among medical and nursing students was 26% (95% CI 6% to 46%, I2 = 99.3%) while the prevalence among all types of health care workers was 57% (95% CI 44% to 70%, I2 = 99.1%). Incidence of LTBI was available for health care workers in four countries. The cumulative incidence ranged from 2.8% in Brazilian medical students to 38% among all types of health care workers in South Africa. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that there is a high burden of LTBI among health care workers in high burden countries. Adequate infection control measures are warranted to prevent and control transmission in health care settings. ? 2016 Nasreen et al.

Their natural reservoir is intestinal. Methods: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate CRE and ESBL carriage duration and to evaluate the effect of decolonization therapy. We included cohort and comparative studies examining the natural history of CRE/ESBL colonization, examining rates of carriage following decolonization or comparing decolonization and no decolonization conducted in the healthcare setting or in the community. A comprehensive search was conducted until November 2015. We compiled carriage rates at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months with and without decolonization therapy and assessed the effect of decolonization. Results: Thirty-seven studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. In healthcare settings, pooled ESBL/CRE colonization rates decreased without intervention from 76.7% (95% CI = 69.3%-82.8%) at 1 month to 35.2% (95% CI = 28.2%-42.9%) at 12 months of follow-up. Following decolonization, the rate was 37.1% (95% CI = 27.5%-47.7%) at end of therapy and 57.9% (95% CI = 43.1%-71.4%) at 1 month. In two randomized trials, carriage was significantly reduced at end of therapy (risk ratio = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.25-0.65), but the effect was not significant after 1 month (risk ratio = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.48-1.05), with no longer follow-up. Heterogeneity was explained by surveillance methodology, with no differences observed between ESBLs and CREs. Among community dwellers, ESBL colonization decreased from 52.3% (95% CI = 29.5%-74.2%) at 1 month to 19.2% (95% CI = 9.7%-34.4%) at 6 months. Conclusions: A significant proportion of ESBL and CRE carriers remain colonized up to 1 year in the healthcare setting. While short-term decolonization therapy reduces carriage during therapy, its longer-term effects are unclear. ? The Author 2016.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,PLoS ONE,10.1371/journal.pone.0165179,27783692,"Background/Aims: Total gastrectomy (TG) has shown to be superior regarding low risk of recurrence and readmission to distal subtotal gastrectomy (DG) for treatment of distal stomach cancer, but the incidence of postoperative morbidity and mortality in TG cannot be ignored. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to compare the effectiveness between TG and DG for distal stomach cancer. Methodology: A search in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedical Database through January 2016 was performed. Eligible studies in comparing of TG and DG for distal gastric cancer were included in this meta-analysis. Review Manager 5.2 software from the Cochrane Collaboration was used for the performance of meta-analysis and STATA 12.0 software for meta-regression analysis. Results: Ten retrospective cohort studies and one randomized control trial involving 5447 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed no significant difference of postoperative mortality (RR = 1.48, 95%CI = 0. 90-2.44,p = 0.12), intraoperative blood loss (MD = 24.34, 95%CI = -3.31-51.99, p = 0.08) and length of hospital stay(MD = 0.76, 95%CI:-0.26-1.79, p = 0.15). TG procedure could retrieve more lymph nodes than DG(MD = 4.33, 95% CI = 2.34-6.31, p<0.0001). According to different postoperative complications, we performed subgroup analysis, subgroup analysis revealed that patients in TG group tended to have a higher rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess than DG procedure (RR = 3.41, 95% CI = 1.21-9.63, p<0.05). No statistical differences were found in leakage, intestinal obstruction, postoperative bleeding, anastomotic stricture and wound infection between the two groups (p>0.05). We pooled the data together, the accumulated 5-year Overall Survival rates of TG and DG groups were 49.6% (919/1852) vs.55.9%(721/1290) respectively. Meta-analysis revealed a favoring trend to DG procedure and there was a statistical difference between the two groups (RR = 0.91,95% CI = 0.85-0.97,p = 0.006). Conclusion: Based on current retrospective evidences, we found that in spite of similar postoperative mortality, TG for distal gastric cancer provided a high risk of five-year Overall Survival rate. DG procedure can be a recommendation for distal gastric cancer, whereas due to lack of high quality RCTs in multicenter and the relatively small sample size of long-term outcomes, further comparative studies are still needed. ? 2016 Qi et al.

There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of anastomotic leak rates (OR 0.80, 95?% confidence interval (CI) 0.47, 1.37; p?=?0.42), stricture (OR 0.54: 95?% CI 0.18, 1.64; p?=?0.28) or mortality (OR 0.70; 95?% CI 0.39, 1.26; p?=?0.24). Compression anastomosis was associated with an earlier return of bowel function: 1.02 (95?% CI 1.37, 0.66) days earlier (p?<?0.001) and a shorter postoperative stay; 1.13 (95?% CI 1.52, 0.74) days shorter (p?<?0.001), but significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. There was an increased risk of postoperative bowel obstruction in the compression group (OR 1.87; 95?% CI 1.07, 3.26; p?=?0.03). There was no significant difference in wound-related and general complications, or length of surgery. Compression devices do not appear to provide an advantage over conventional techniques in fashioning colorectal anastomoses and are associated with an increased risk of bowel obstruction. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing AG."

Methods We performed a systematic review of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar to identify relevant randomized controlled trials in the English- and German-language literature. Eligibility criteria included randomized controlled trials comparing at least 1 surgical intervention with MIPO and reporting the primary clinical outcome using a validated functional scoring system and description of complications. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot, and the risk of bias was established using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool. Heterogeneity was assessed using £q2 and I2 statistics. Results Eight prospective randomized studies (N?=?376) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate for clinical outcome showed that MIPO resulted in a significantly better outcome (standardized mean difference, 0.366; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.571; P?=?.0001; I2?=?61%). The pooled estimate for all complications showed that the open reduction¡Vinternal fixation/nail group had a significantly higher complication rate (odds ratio, 0.507; 95% confidence interval, 0.285 to 0.905; P?=?.021; I2?=?97%). Conclusion Current evidence indicates the MIPO approach has better clinical outcomes with a lower rate of complications compared with alternative surgical techniques. However, the results of this meta-analysis are limited by problems inherent in the primary studies, including poor reporting of randomization protocols, as well as possible attrition bias and reporting bias, of the primary studies. Future publications may therefore change the trend of the pooled estimate in either direction. ? 2016 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees"

Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years, yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions, all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve, through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables. Temperature was the most influential variable, for both the strength and magnitude of the effect-size. Moderator variables explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity among effect-sizes. Salinity and pH were important factors, although future work is required to broaden the range of abiotic factors examined, as well as including further diurnal variation and greater environmental realism generally. We were unable to extract a quantitative effect-size estimate for approximately half (50.4%) of the reported experimental outcomes and we strongly recommend a minimum set of quantitative reporting to be included in all studies, which will allow robust assimilation and analysis of future findings. In addition we suggest possible means of increasing the applicability of future studies to the natural environment, and evaluating the biological content of natural waterbodies. ? 2016 Dalziel et al.

This meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the survival rate from HIV diagnosis to AIDS onset and from AIDS onset to death. Methods The electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus were searched to February 2016. In addition, the reference lists of included studies were checked to identify further references, and the database of the International AIDS Society was also searched. Cohort studies addressing the survival rate in patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were included in this meta-analysis. The outcomes of interest were the survival rate of patients diagnosed with HIV progressing to AIDS, and the survival rate of patients with AIDS dying from AIDS-related causes with or without highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The survival rate (P) was estimated with 95% confidence intervals based on random-effects models. Results In total, 27,862 references were identified, and 57 studies involving 294,662 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Two, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-year survival probabilities of progression from HIV diagnosis to AIDS onset were estimated to be 82%, 72%, 64%, 57%, 26% and 19%, respectively. Two, 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-year survival probabilities of progression from AIDS onset to AIDS-related death in patients who received HAART were estimated to be 87%, 86%, 78%, 78%, and 61%, respectively, and 2-, 4- and 6-year survival probabilities of progression from AIDS onset to AIDS-related death in patients who did not receive HAART were estimated to be 48%, 26% and 18%, respectively. Evidence of considerable heterogeneity was found. The majority of the studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. Conclusion The majority of HIV-positive patients progress to AIDS within the first decade of diagnosis. Most patients who receive HAART will survive for >10 years after the onset of AIDS, whereas the majority of the patients who do not receive HAART die within 2 years of the onset of AIDS. ? 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health"

Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of cervical disk arthroplasty (CDA) compared with anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of 2-level cervical spondylopathy. Summary of Background Data: CDA has emerged as a potential alternative to ACDF in patients with cervical disk degeneration. But there are no published systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing CDA with ACDF for the treatment of 2-level cervical spondylopathy. Methods: The Pubmed, Embase, Web of science, Scopus, and Cochrane library databases were searched comparing CDA to ACDF in patients with 2-level cervical spondylopathy. Outcome measures were neck disability index, visual analog scale (VAS) of arm and neck pain, range of movement (ROM) at C2-C7, functional segment unit ROM, ROM at the operated level, and incidence of radiologic changes at adjacent levels approximately 2 years after surgery, as well as operating time and incidence of surgery-related complications. Mean difference (MD), odds ratios (OR), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Results: Six studies involving 646 patients were included. There were no significant differences in neck disability index (MD, -1.53; 95% CI -3.80 to 0.73), VAS neck pain (MD, -0.19; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.33), and VAS arm pain (MD, -0.23; 95% CI -0.61 to 0.16) between 2-level CDA and 2-level ACDF cases. ROM at C2-C7 (MD, 15.82; 95% CI, 10.66-20.99), functional segment unit ROM (MD, 8.58; 95% CI, 7.93-9.23), and ROM at the operated level (MD, 9.54; 95% CI, 7.73-11.35) were greater, but the incidence of radiologic changes at adjacent levels (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.67) were lower, in 2-level CDA cases. In 2-level CDA cases, the operating time was longer (MD, 57.41; 95% CI, 24.67-90.14), but surgery-related complications rates (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30-0.74) was lower.

The differences in therapeutic effectiveness between cannulated screw fixation (CSF) and plate fixation are still unclear. Thus, in this meta-analysis, we evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness of these two fixation methods. Materials and methods We searched for all publications on DIACFs fixated with cannulated screws or plates in the following electronic databases: Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase and CNKI. Only randomized controlled studies were included. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.1.0) was applied for analysis. The primary outcomes were American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society score (AOFAS), improvement of Bohler's angle, improvement of Gissane's angle and the width of the calcaneus. Outcomes were reported as the standard mean difference (SMD) or relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). A random effects model was used to assess the pooled data. Results Five randomized controlled studies met our inclusion criteria, and a total of 707 patients were involved. There was no statistically significant difference between the cannulated screw fixation group and the plate fixation group in terms of excellent and good AOFAS scores (RR?=?1.01, 95%CI 0.91 to 1.13, P?=?0.79), improvement of Bohler's angle (SMD?=?0.12, 95%CI??0.03 to 0.28, P?=?0.12), improvement of Gissane's angle (SMD?=?0.09, 95%CI??0.28 to 0.26, P?=?0.30), or the width of the calcaneus (SMD?=??0.07, 95%CI??0.24 to 0.10, p?=?0.45). Compared with plate fixation, CSF showed a significant reduction in the duration of surgery (SMD?=??1.74, 95%CI,??3.35 to??0.13, P?=?0.03) and rate of complications (RR?=?0.25, 95%CI, 0.15 to 0.44, P¡Õ0.00001). Conclusions Cannulated screw fixation and plate fixation have similar fixation effectiveness and functional outcomes in the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneus fractures. Due to the shorter duration of surgery and low rate of complications, cannulated screw fixation is superior to plate fixation.

Gentamicin Collagen Sponge (GCS) is one of the clinical measures to prevent SSI after colorectal surgery, but the effectiveness is still contentious. This study searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Web of SCI, Pubmed, SCOPUS EBSCO and CINAHL. After screening, all included data was analyzed by RevMan software. Totally 1870 patients from 10 random clinical trials (RCTs) were included in this study. The infection rates of surgical site, superficial wound, deep wound, organ space infection and incision complication in the GCS group were all not significantly different compared to those in the control group. As stratified by follow-up duration and control types, the infection rates were also not significantly different between GCS group and control group. In the gentamicin dosage subgroup analysis, this meta-analysis found the incidence of SSI in GCS group was lower than that of control group when the gentamicin dosage was smaller than 200 mg (risk ratio (RR): 0.62; 95% credibility interval (CI): 0.42 to 0.93). GCS applied could decrease the SSI incidence in Western Europe. Low dose of gentamicin applied (less than or equal to 200 mg) in GCS could decrease the SSI incidence compared to control group, while high dose might prejudice wound healing. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

However, it still remains unknown whether TLIF with unilateral pedicle screw (PS) fixation is superior to that with bilateral PS fixation. This meta-analysis was performed to compare the relative benefits and risks of unilateral and bilateral PS fixation in TLIF for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. Methods: Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). All data were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3 software. A random effect model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used. Results: Eleven randomized and one quasi-randomized controlled trials were retrieved in the meta-analysis. Overall, there were significant differences between the two groups for operative time and blood loss. No significant differences were detected regarding fusion rate, total complication rate, dura tear, superficial wound infection, screw-related complications, reoperation rate, visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA), the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) scores, and hospital stay. Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that unilateral fixation group was superior to bilateral fixation group regarding operative time and blood loss. However, the results of fusion rate, total complication rate, specific complications, reoperation rate, functional outcomes and hospital stay were similar in the two groups. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that unilateral PS fixation in TLIF is a good alternative to bilateral PS fixation for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disease. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Data on factors associated with abnormal embryo implantation following assisted conception are limited. Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine whether there is an association between the day (cleavage-stage, D3, versus blastocyst, D5) or the type (fresh versus frozen/thawed) of ET and EP rate. Risk factors for EP were evaluated in a retrospective study of 1194 women, who achieved pregnancy at our IVF unit between 2010 and 2016. Results: Sixteen papers were considered for the meta-analysis. EP rate did not differ between D3 and D5 fresh ET groups (RR = 0.99, 95%CI: 0.76¡V1.30) and was higher after fresh versus frozen ET (RR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.25¡V1.95). At our clinic, 21 (1.76%) pregnancies were documented as ectopic. The risk of EP was associated with tubal pathology (OR = 3.37, 95%CI: 1.39¡V8.2), previous appendectomy and past chlamydial infection. Conclusions: Present meta-analysis suggests that EP rate is similar following fresh blastocyst and cleavage ETs, but is significantly reduced after frozen compared with fresh ET. Our own findings demonstrate that tubal pathology has the major impact on EP occurrence following assisted conception. ? 2016 The Author(s).

Design: Meta-analysis summarizing the difference in mortality between HEU and HUU infants and children. Reviewed studies comparing children in the two groups for all-cause mortality, in any setting, from 1994 to 2016 from six databases. Methods: Meta-analyses were done estimating overall mortality comparing the two groups, stratified by duration of follow-up time from birth (0-12, 12-24 and >24 months) and by year enrollment ended in each study: Less than 2002 compared with at least 2002, when single-dose nevirapine for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) commenced in low-income and middle-income countries. Results: Included 22 studies, for a total of 29 212 study participants [n=840 (30.3%) HEU; n=20 372 (37.7%) HUU]. Random effects models showed HEU had a more than 70% increased risk of mortality vs. HUU. Stratifying by age showed that HEU vs. HUU had a significant 60-70% increased risk of death at every age strata. There was a significant 70% increase in the risk of mortality between groups before the implementation of PMTCT, which remained after 2002 [risk ratio: 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-1.87], when the availability of PMTCT services was widespread, suggesting that prenatal antiretroviral therapy, and healthier mothers, does not fully eliminate this increased risk in mortality. Conclusion: We show a consistent increase risk of mortality for HEU vs. HUU infants and children. Longitudinal research is needed to elucidate underlying mechanisms, such as maternal and infant health status and breast feeding practices, which may help explain these differences in mortality. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

A previous meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials suggested that it might be an alternative to vancomycin in cases of difficult-to-treat meticillin-resistant S. aureus infections. We did a meta-analysis including one new trial to access the efficacy and safety of telavancin. Methods: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov up to December 30, 2015 to identify randomized controlled trials that assessed the clinical efficacy, eradication efficiency, adverse events and laboratory abnormalities of telavancin vs. other antibiotic agents for bacterial infection. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3.0. Results: Five studies (3790 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in treatment success with telavancin than with control antibiotic agents. The pooled pathogen eradication for the telavancin group was numerically higher than that for the control groups, but there was no significant difference. While all-cause mortalities and serious adverse events were comparable between telavancin and control antibiotic agents, adverse event-related withdrawals (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.13-1.91) were higher in telavancin group. The total number adverse events were more in the telavancin group than in the control groups, especially in the digestive system (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.37-1.79), nervous system (OR 2.14, 95% CI 1.86-2.47) and urogenital system (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.99-3.25). Serum creatinine increase (OR 2.25, 95% Cl 1.78-2.85) and hypokalemia (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.19-2.53) occurred more frequently in telavancin group compared to control groups. Conclusion: Telavancin may be as effective as but no better than the comparison therapy for S. aureus infection. However, because of the high risk of adverse event-related withdrawals and potential nephrotoxicity, prudence with the clinical use of telavancin in infections is required. ??? 2016 Chuan, Zhang, He, Zhu, Zhong, Yu and Xiao."

Method: A systematic search of MeSH, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and PubMed was performed. Studies of humans in which all individuals had laboratory confirmed influenza, and all individuals were tested for an array of common bacterial species, met inclusion criteria. Results: Twenty-seven studies including 3215 participants met?all inclusion criteria. Common etiologies were defined from a subset of eight articles. There was high heterogeneity in the results (I2?=?95%), with reported coinfection rates ranging from 2% to 65%. Although only a subset of papers were responsible for observed heterogeneity, subanalyses and meta-regression analysis found no study characteristic that was significantly associated with coinfection. The most common coinfecting species were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 35% (95% CI, 14%¡V56%) and 28% (95% CI, 16%¡V40%) of infections, respectively; a wide range of other pathogens caused the remaining infections. An assessment of bias suggested that lack of small-study publications may have biased the results. Conclusions: The frequency of coinfection in the published studies included in this review suggests that although providers should consider possible bacterial coinfection in all patients hospitalized with influenza, they should not assume all patients are coinfected and be sure to properly treat underlying viral processes. Further, high heterogeneity suggests additional large-scale studies are needed to better understand the etiology of influenza bacterial coinfection. ? 2016 The Authors.

However, whether injection of rhTM can affect the mortality of those patients in clinical treatment remains controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy for patients with infection complicated by DIC. Methods The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant articles that met the inclusion criteria through April 2016. Reference lists of the retrieved articles were also reviewed. The 28- or 30-day mortality and bleeding risk after using rhTM were evaluated. Results Ten observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 18?288 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The risk ratio for the 28- or 30-day mortality was 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.06) in RCT studies and 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.01) in observational studies. There were no significant differences in the bleeding risk between the rhTM group and the control group. Conclusion Based on the current studies, using rhTM for the treatment for infection patients complicated with DIC does not decrease the short-term mortality of those patients. More high-quality RCT studies need to be performed to confirm this finding. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

We aimed to systematically summarize results from interventions studying the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation on clinical and laboratory confirmed RTIs in healthy adults and children. Methods Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL were screened from inception until present (last updated in January 2016) completed by a search of the grey literature, clinical trial registers and conference abstracts. We included randomized trials comparing vitamin D versus placebo or no treatment. Two independent reviewers were responsible for study selection and data extraction. Cochrane's risk of bias tool and the GRADE approach were used for quality assessment. Estimates were pooled with random-effects models. Heterogeneity was explored by sub-group and meta-regression analyses. Results Of 2627 original hits, 15 trials including 7053 individuals were ultimately eligible. All used oral cholecalciferol. We found a 6% risk reduction with vitamin D3 supplementation on clinical RTIs, but the result was not statistically significant (RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). Heterogeneity was large (I-square 57%) and overall study quality was low. There were too few studies to reliably assess a potential risk reduction of laboratory confirmed RTI. Evidence was insufficient to demonstrate an association between vitamin D supplementation and risk of clinical RTI in sub-groups with vitamin D deficiency. Conclusions In previously healthy individuals vitamin D supplementation does not reduce the risk of clinical RTIs. However, this conclusion is based on a meta-Analysis where the included studies differed with respect to population, baseline vitamin D levels and study length. This needs to be considered when interpreting the results. Future trials should focus on vitamin D deficient individuals and apply more objective and standardized outcome measurements. ? 2016 Vuichard Gysin et al.

The present study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic versus open repair for peptic ulcer disease. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing laparoscopic versus open repair for peptic ulcer disease were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and references of identified articles and relevant reviews. Primary outcomes were postoperative complications, mortality, and reoperation. Secondary outcomes were operative time, postoperative pain, postoperative hospital stay, nasogastric tube duration, and time to resume diet. Statistical analysis was carried out by Review Manage software. Results Five RCTs investigating a total of 549 patients, of whom, 279 received laparoscopic repair and 270 received open repair, were included in the final analysis. There were no significant differences between these two procedures in some primary outcomes including overal postoperative complication rate, mortality, and reoperation rate. Subcategory analysis of postoperative complications showed that laparoscopic repair had also similar rates of repair site leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, postoperative ileus, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection as open surgery, except of the lower surgical site infection rate (P?<?0.05). In addition, there were also no significant differences between these two procedures in some second outcomes including operative time, postoperative hospital stay, and time to resume diet, but laparoscopic repair had shorter nasogastric tube duration (P?<?0.05) and less postoperative pain (P?<?0.05) than open surgery. Conclusions Laparoscopic surgery is comparable with open surgery in the setting of repair for perforated peptic ulcer. The obvious advantages of laparoscopic surgery are the lower surgical site infection rate, shorter nasogastric tube duration and less postoperative pain. However, more higher quality studies should be undertaken to further assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic repair for peptic ulcer disease. ? 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

STUDY SELECTION Studies with information on sterile vs nonsterile gloves in outpatient surgical procedures were retrieved. Only randomized clinical trials and comparative studies were included for final analysis. DATA EXTRACTION Data of trial design, surgery characteristics, and outcomes from published manuscripts and unpublished data were independently extracted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Randomized clinical trialswere considered high quality if randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up completeness were appropriate. Relative risk and 95%CIs were derived for postoperative wound infections. RESULTS Fourteen articlesmet eligibility and inclusion criteria for systematic review; they included 12 275 unique patients who had undergone 12 275 unique outpatient procedures with sterile or nonsterile gloves and had follow-up regarding SSI. With the exclusion of 1 single-arm observational study of 1204 patients, 11 071 patients from 13 studies remained in the meta-analysis. Of these, 228 patients were documented as having postoperative SSI (2.1%), including 107 of 5031 patients in the nonsterile glove group (2.1%) and 121 of 6040 patients in the sterile glove group (2.0%).

Methods Eligible prospective and retrospective studies were identified through manual and electronic searches (August 2015). The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Meta-analyses were performed with subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses to evaluate sources of heterogeneity. Results We included 71 studies (n?=?6970 patients). Thirty-seven (52%) studies used a prospective design and 25 scored ?5 points on the NOS suggesting a low risk of bias. Forty studies were descriptive and 31 studies evaluated invasive interventions. In total, 801 of 2842 patients (28%) with infected necroses and 537 of 4128 patients (13%) with sterile necroses died with an odds ratio [OR] of 2.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00¡V3.31) based on all studies and 2.02 (95%CI, 1.61¡V2.53) in the studies with the lowest bias risk. The OR for prospective studies was 2.96 (95%CI, 2.51¡V3.50). In sensitivity analyses excluding studies evaluating invasive interventions, the OR was 3.30 (95%CI, 2.81¡V3.88). Patients with infected necrosis and organ failure had a mortality of 35.2% while concomitant sterile necrosis and organ failure was associated with a mortality of 19.8%. If the patients had infected necrosis without organ failure the mortality was 1.4%. Conclusions Patients with necrotizing pancreatitis are more than twice as likely to die if the necrosis becomes infected.

There is, however, no consensus on management prior to removal of the indwelling catheter for short-term patients. This systematic review examined the necessity of clamping before removal of an indwelling urinary catheter in short-term patients. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using eight databases and predetermined keywords-guided searches. Some 2,515 studies were evaluated. Ten studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Results The quality of the studies was assessed using the Jadad scoring system. Only 40.0% of studies were rated as high quality. This review found that catheter clamping prior to removal was not necessary for the short-term patient. When made a comparison with the unclamping group, there was no significant difference in recatheterization risk, risk of urine retention, patients¡¦ subjective perceptions and rate of urinary tract infection. Conclusions This review indicated that bladder training by clamping prior to removal of urinary catheters is not necessary in short-term catheter patients.

Methods: A systematic literature search was undertaken of published and unpublished databases on the 5 November 2015. All papers reporting studies comparing obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery prior to arthroplasty, or not, were included. Each study was assessed using the Downs and Black appraisal tool. A meta-analysis of risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) was performed to determine the incidence of complications including wound infection, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), revision surgery and mortality. Results: From 156 potential studies, five were considered to be eligible for inclusion in the study. A total of 23 348 patients (657 who had undergone bariatric surgery, 22 691 who had not) were analysed. The evidence-base was moderate in quality. There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes such as superficial wound infection (relative risk (RR) 1.88; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 0.37), deep wound infection (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.66), DVT (RR 0.57; 95% CI 0.13 to 2.44), PE (RR 0.51; 95% CI 0.03 to 8.26), revision surgery (RR 1.24; 95% CI 0.75 to 2.05) or mortality (RR 1.25; 95% CI 0.16 to 9.89) between the two groups. Conclusion: For most peri-operative outcomes, bariatric surgery prior to THA or TKA does not significantly reduce the complication rates or improve the clinical outcome.

Aims: To systematically review the efficacy of levofloxacin triple therapy in the first- and second-line treatment, and to assess the time trend and factors that might affect its efficacy. Methods: Prospective trials reporting the efficacy of levofloxacin triple therapy in either the first-line or second-line treatment of H. pylori infection in adults were searched from the PubMed and Cochrane database from January 2000 to September 2015. Meta-analysis was performed to calculate the cumulative eradication rate and the efficacies in subgroups. Results: Of the 322 articles identified, a total of 4574 patients from 41 trials, including 16 trials in the first-line treatment and 25 trials in the second-line treatment were eligible for analysis.

The four studies adjusting for time of follow-up and confounders showed a relative risk of 0.46 (95% CI = 0.29 to 0.72, I2 = 44.4%). Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that eradication therapy for H. pylori prevents gastric cancer. There was insufficient literature for meta-analysis of MALT lymphoma or esophageal cancer. ? 2016 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved."

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence about the efficacy and safety of using safety-engineered intravenous devices and safety-engineered phlebotomy devices by HCWs. Methods: We included randomized and non-randomized studies comparing safety-engineered devices to conventional/standard devices that lack safety features for delivering intravenous injections and/or for blood-withdrawal procedures (phlebotomy). The outcomes of interest included NSI rates, and blood-borne infections rates among HCWs and patients. We conducted an extensive literature search strategy using the OVID interface in October 2013. We followed the standard methods for study selection and data abstraction. When possible, we conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model. We used the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of evidence by outcome. Results: We identified twenty-two eligible studies: Twelve assessed safety-engineered devices for intravenous procedures, five for phlebotomy procedures, and five for both. Twenty-one of those studies were observational while one was a randomized trial. All studies assessed the reduction in NSIs among HCWs. For safety-engineered intravenous devices, the pooled relative risk for NSI per HCW was 0.28 [0.13, 0.59] (moderate quality evidence). The pooled relative risk for NSI per device used or procedure performed was 0.34 [0.08,1.49] (low quality evidence). For safety-engineered phlebotomy devices, the pooled relative risk for NSI per HCW was 0.57 [0.38, 0.84] (moderate quality evidence). The pooled relative risk for NSI per device used or procedure performed was 0.53 [0.43,0.65] (moderate quality evidence). We identified no studies assessing the outcome of blood-borne infections among healthcare workers or patients. Conclusion: There is moderate-quality evidence that the use of safety-engineered devices in intravenous injections and infusions, and phlebotomy (blood-drawing) procedures reduces NSI rates of HCWs. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

We conducted a meta-analysis of trials examining the bioavailability of generic (test) immunosuppressive drugs relative to their brand (reference) counterparts in healthy volunteers, based on the US Food and Drug Administration requirements for approval of generics, and their efficacy and safety in kidney transplant recipients. Methods: Eligible studies were identified in PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference abstracts. Results: Twenty crossover trials of healthy volunteers (n = 641) and 6 parallel-arm randomized controlled trials of kidney transplant recipients (n = 594) were identified. The 90% CI of the pooled test-to-reference drug ratio for maximum or peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration time-curve from time 0 to time of last determinable concentration (AUC(0-t)) fell within the required range (0.80-1.25) for cyclosporine (Cmax 0.91; 90% CI 0.86-0.95; and AUC(0-t) 0.97; 90% CI 0.94-1.00), tacrolimus (Cmax 1.17; 90% CI 1.09-1.24; and AUC(0-t) 1.00; 90% CI 0.97-1.03) and mycophenolate mofetil (Cmax 0.98; 90% CI 0.96-1.01; and AUC(0-t) 1.00; 90% CI 0.99-1.01). In subgroup analyses, some generic cyclosporine formulations did not meet criteria for bioequivalence. No significant differences were observed in the time to maximum plasma concentration and terminal plasma half-life between generic and brand drugs. In parallel-arm trials, generic cyclosporine was non-inferior to brand counterpart in terms of acute allograft rejection, infections, and death. Conclusions: Not all generic immunosuppressive drugs have similar relative bioavailability to their brand name counterparts. Evidence on their efficacy and safety is inconclusive. Tighter regulatory requirement for approval of generic drugs with narrow therapeutic index is needed. ? 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the impact of statin therapy on plasma lipid concentrations through a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The literature search included PUBMED, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar up to October 30, 2015. The meta-analysis was performed using either a fixed-effects or random-effect model according to I2 statistic. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Two investigators independently reviewed the title or abstract, further reviewed the full-texts and extracted information on study characteristics and study outcomes. Meta-analysis of 12 RCTs with 697 participants suggested significant reductions in plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (WMD: ?0.72?mmol/L [?27.8?mg/dL], 95%CI: ?1.04, ?0.39, p?&lt;?0.001; I2?=?85.7%), total cholesterol (WMD: ?1.03?mmol/L [-39.8?mg/dL], 95%CI: ?1.42, ?0.64, p?&lt;?0.001; I2?=?94.7%) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (WMD: ?0.81?mmol/L [?31.3?mg/dl], 95%CI: ?1.32, ?0.30, p?=?0.002; I2?=?76.5%), and elevations in HDL-C (WMD: 0.072?mmol/L [2.8?mg/dL], 95%CI: 0.053, 0.092, p?&lt;?0.001; I2?=?0%) following treatment with statins (mostly of moderate-intensity). No significant alteration in plasma triglycerides (TG) concentrations was found (WMD: ?0.16?mmol/L [?14.2?mg/dL], 95%CI: ?0.61, 0.29, p?=?0.475; I2?=?90.2%). All these effects were robust in sensitivity analysis, suggesting that the computed effect is not driven by any single study. In subgroup analysis, no significant difference was found among different statins in terms of changing plasma concentrations of LDL-C, HDL-C and TG. However, atorvastatin was found to be more efficacious in reducing plasma total cholesterol concentrations (p?&lt;?0.001).

Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TUEP and OP were identified from PubMed, Embase and Web of Science up to February 28, 2015. A meta-analysis was conducted with the STATA 12.0 software. Results: Nine RCTs including 758 patients were enrolled in our meta-analysis. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the maximum urinary flow rate at 1, 3, 6?months, 1 and 2?years: postvoiding residual urinary volume, prostate-specific antigen, international prostate symptom score and quality of life score at 1, 3, 6?months and 1?year; or international index of erectile function at 3, 6?months and 1?year. Perioperative outcomes including hemoglobin level drop, catheter period, irrigation length and hospital stay favored TUEP, while operative time and resected prostate weight favored OP. There was significantly less blood transfusion with TUEP, but no significant differences were found in other complications such as recatheterization, urinary tract infection, reintervention for clots and bleeding control, incidence of pneumonia and infarction, transient incontinence, bladder neck contracture, urethral stricture and recurrent adenoma. Conclusions: TUEP can be performed effectively and safely with functional outcomes and complications similar to OP for large BPH, whereas it has the advantages of a shorter catheter period, shorter hospital stays and less blood transfusion.

Method: Multiple databases and previous publications were searched through June 2015 to identify all randomized controlled trials of any add-on antidepressants compared with placebo or no-treatment in schizophrenia. Depressive and negative symptoms (primary outcomes), overall symptoms, positive symptoms, side effects, exacerbation of psychosis, and responder rates were examined. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as investigations of publication bias and risk of bias. Results: Eighty-two randomized controlled trials with a total of 3,608 participants were included. Add-on antidepressants appeared more efficacious than controls for depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference:-0.25, 95% CI=-0.38 to-0.12), negative symptoms (standardized mean difference:-0.30, 95% CI=-0.44 to-0.16), overall symptoms (standardizedmeandifference:-0.24,95%CI=-0.39to-0.09), positive symptoms (standardized mean difference:-0.17, 95% CI=-0.33 to-0.01), quality of life (standardized mean difference:-0.32, 95% CI=-0.57 to-0.06), and responder rate (risk ratio: 1.52, 95% CI=1.29 to 1.78; numberneeded-to-treat-to-benefit: 5, 95% CI=4 to 7). The effects on depressive and negative symptoms appeared more pronounced when minimum thresholds of these symptoms were inclusion criteria (standardized mean difference:-0.34, 95% CI=-0.58 to-0.09 and standardized mean difference:-0.58, 95% CI=-0.94 to-0.21, respectively). There were no significant differences between antidepressants and controls in terms of exacerbation of psychosis, premature discontinuation, and the number of participants with at least one adverse event. More patients taking add-on antidepressants suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, dizziness, and dry mouth. Conclusions: Analysis of primary outcomes (depressive and negative symptoms) suggests small, beneficial effects of adjunctive antidepressants. It would appear that this augmentation can be accomplished with a low risk of exacerbation of psychosis and adverse effects.

Lenalidomide has been proved to be effective for relapsed/refractory CLL as a single agent or in combination with various chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens. However, current clinical experience in its usage is still limited. Because of existing considerable variability in different studies, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to describe overall response rate (ORR) of lenalidomide in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Pooled estimate of cumulative prevalence of total ORR was 42.23?% (95?% confidence interval [CI], 32.49¡V52.61?%), while pooled ORR in regimen with lenalidomide plus anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAbs) and lenalidomide mono-therapy were 60.01?% (95?% CI, 53.86¡V65.86?%) and 24.38?% (95?% CI, 16.15¡V35.06?%), respectively.

The search was not restricted by the age of the patients or the language of the study. However, in the final analysis we only included studies involving patients that were published in English language journals or had official English translations. In addition, we reviewed the bibliographic databases of published articles for additional studies. Results: This systematic review of the literature identified a total of 16 meta-analyses that evaluated the use of antipsychotics in individuals with dementia. Overall, 12 meta-analyses evaluated the efficacy of antipsychotics among individuals with dementia. Of these, eight also assessed adverse effects. A further two studies evaluated the adverse effects of antipsychotics (i.e. death). A total of two meta-analyses evaluated the discontinuation of antipsychotics in individuals with dementia. Overall, three meta-analyses were conducted in individuals with Alzheimer¡¦s disease (AD) whereas one focused on individuals with Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). The rest of the 12 meta-analyses included individuals with dementia. Conclusions: Antipsychotics have demonstrated modest efficacy in treating psychosis, aggression and agitation in individuals with dementia. Their use in individuals with dementia is often limited by their adverse effect profile. The use of antipsychotics should be reserved for severe symptoms that have failed to respond adequately to nonpharmacological management strategies. ? 2016, ? The Author(s), 2016."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, with intention-to-treat analysis, of randomized controlled clinical trials that assessed the effectiveness of different intraoral chlorhexidine protocols for the prevention of VAP. METHODS: Search strategies were developed for the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS databases. MeSH terms were combined with Boolean operators and used to search the databases. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of mechanically ventilated subjects receiving oral care with chlorhexidine or standard oral care protocols consisting of or associated with the use of a placebo or no chemicals. Pooled estimates of the relative risk and corresponding 95% CIs were calculated with random effects models, and heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q statistic and I2. RESULTS: The 13 included studies provided data on 1,640 subjects that were randomly allocated to chlorhexidine (n = 834) or control (n = 806) treatments. A preliminary analysis revealed that oral application of chlorhexidine fails to promote a significant reduction in VAP incidence (relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.59-1.07, I2 = 45%). However, subgroup analyses showed that chlorhexidine prevents VAP development when used at 2% concentration (relative risk 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.91, I2 = 0%) or 4 times/d (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.81, I2 = 0%).

This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services. Methods and Findings: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age ? 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95% CI 1.92¡V2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95% CI 2.07¡V3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95% CI 1.25¡V1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data. Conclusions: TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men¡¦s access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care. ? 2016 Horton et al."

Relevant original studies were searched in electronic databases of Embase, CNKI, Medline, and Cochrane central database (all through October 2015). RCTs that investigated the effectiveness or complications between both groups and provided sufficient data of interest were included in this meta-analysis. 14 RCTs fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis, with 1270 participants in the IF group and 1425 in the HA group. Patients were followed up for at least one year in all the studies. Compared to IF, HA is a better alternative for treatment of displaced femoral neck fracture in the elderly, with reduced major complications and reoperations, better hip pain relief and favorable hip function in the long run. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the incidence of wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, haematoma, pressure sores, cerebrovascular accident, respiratory infection and urinary tract infection. HA has more advantages than IF for treatment of displaced femoral neck fracture, and could be a better alternative if surgery was indicated.

However, it is unclear whether there is a relationship between obesity and POAF. We thus assessed all available evidence investigating the association between obesity and POAF, also considering any link between POAF and other post-operative conditions such as mortality, stroke, myocardial infarctions and respiratory complications. Methods Five electronic databases were searched and relevant studies were identified. Data was extracted and meta-analyzed from the identified studies. Results We found that obese patients had significantly higher odds of POAF when compared with non-obese patients (P = 0.006). There was also significant heterogeneity among the identified studies. POAF when compared with no-POAF was associated with an increased risk of stroke (P < 0.0001), 30-day mortality (P = 0.005) and respiratory complications (P < 0.00001). However, we found no significant link between POAF and myocardial infarctions (P = 0.79). Conclusions Our findings suggest that obesity is associated with a moderately higher risk of POAF. While POAF is also associated with an increased incidence of stroke, 30-day mortality and respiratory complications, further studies must be conducted before conclusions can be made about the long-term outcomes. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

There is also a lack of high-quality evidence regarding CLBP treatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effectiveness of lumbar surgery vs. nonsurgical treatment for chronic low back pain. METHODS: A search was conducted using MEDLINE ?, Embase, and reference lists of articles and personal files. After a systematic search, studies were selected on the basis of inclusion criteria. Six articles (904 patients) met the inclusion criteria for the study. Pooled estimates of clinical results were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: All six eligible studies were independent randomized clinical trials. Pooled data revealed that, compared with surgical treatment, nonsurgical treatment was associated with better Oswestry Disability Index scores. Both groups had similar Visual Analogue Scale and Emotional Distress Scale scores as well as General Function Scores. CONCLUSIONS: For chronic low back pain, nonsurgical treatment was shown to be effective, feasible, and safe during the follow-up period. More randomized controlled trials are needed to compare surgical and nonsurgical treatment of chronic low back pain. ? 2016 IOS Press and the authors."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a clearer understanding of anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence in Europe and identify risk groups for HEV exposure by a meta-analysis of published studies. Methods: All European HEV-seroprevalence studies from 2003 to 2015 were reviewed. Data were stratified by assay, geographical location, and patient cohort (general population, patients with HIV, solid-organ transplant recipients, chronic liver disease patients, and individuals in contact with swine/wild animals). Data were pooled using amixed-effects model. Results: Four hundred thirty-two studies were initially identified, of which 73 studies were included in the analysis. Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.6% to 52.5%, increased with age, but were unrelated to gender. General population seroprevalence varied depending on assays: Wantai (WT): 17%, Mikrogen (MG): 10%, MP-diagnostics (MP): 7%, DiaPro: 4%, Abbott 2%. The WT assay reported significantly higher seroprevalence rates across all cohorts (p < 0.001). Individuals in contact with swine/wild animals had significantly higher seroprevalence rates than the general population, irrespective of assay (p < 0.0001). There was no difference between any other cohorts. The highest seroprevalence was observed in France (WT: 32%, MP: 16%) the lowest in Italy (WT: 7.5%, MP 0.9%). Seroprevalence varied between and within countries. The observed heterogeneity was attributed to geographical region (23%), assay employed (23%) and study cohort (7%). Conclusion: Seroprevalcence rates primarily depend on the seroassy that is used, followed by the geographical region and study cohort. Seroprevalence is higher in individuals exposed to swine and/or wild animals, and increases with age. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

Administration of a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) to patients undergoing surgery may represent a potential preventive strategy. Aim To conduct a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which high FiO2 was compared with normal FiO2 in patients undergoing surgery to estimate the effect on the development of SSI. Methods A comprehensive search was undertaken for randomized controlled trials (until December 2015) that compared high FiO2 with normal FiO2 in adults undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia and reported on SSI. Findings This study included 17 randomized controlled trials with 8093 patients. Infection rates were 13.11% in the control group and 11.53% in the hyperoxic group, while the overall risk ratio was 0.893 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.794¡V1.003; P?=?0.057]. Subgroup analyses stratified by country, definition of SSI, and type of surgery were also performed, and showed similar results. However, high FiO2 was found to be of significant benefit in patients undergoing colorectal surgery, with a risk ratio of 0.735 (95% CI 0.573¡V0.944; P?=?0.016). Conclusions There is moderate evidence to suggest that administration of high FiO2 to patients undergoing surgery, especially colorectal surgery, reduces the risk of SSI.

We sought to determine the efficacy of ASPs and their effect on clinical and economic parameters. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar looking for studies on the efficacy of ASPs in hospitals. Based on 26 studies (extracted from 24,917 citations) with pre- and postimplementation periods from 6 months to 3 years, the pooled percentage change of total antimicrobial consumption after the implementation of ASPs was -19.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = -30.1 to -7.5), and the use of restricted antimicrobial agents decreased by -26.6% (95% CI = -52.3 to -0.8). Interestingly, in intensive care units, the decrease in antimicrobial consumption was -39.5% (95% CI = -72.5 to -6.4). The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (-18.5% [95% CI = -32 to -5.0] for carbapenems and -14.7% [95% CI = -27.7 to -1.7] for glycopeptides), the overall antimicrobial cost (-33.9% [95% CI = -42.0 to -25.9]), and the hospital length of stay (-8.9% [95% CI = -12.8 to -5]) decreased. Among hospital pathogens, the implementation of ASPs was associated with a decrease in infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (risk difference [RD] = -0.017 [95% CI = -0.029 to -0.005]), imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (RD = -0.079 [95% CI = -0.114 to -0.040]), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Klebsiella spp. (RD = -0.104 [95% CI = -0.153 to -0.055]). Notably, these improvements were not associated with adverse outcomes, since the all-cause, infection-related 30-day mortality and infection rates were not significantly different after implementation of an ASP (RD = -0.001 [95% CI = -0.009 to 0.006], RD = -0.005 [95% CI = -0.016 to 0.007], and RD = -0.045% [95% CI = -0.241 to 0.150], respectively). Hospital ASPs result in significant decreases in antimicrobial consumption and cost, and the benefit is higher in the critical care setting. Infections due to specific antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and the overall hospital length of stay are improved as well. Future studies should focus on the sustainability of these outcomes and evaluate potential beneficial long-term effects of ASPs in mortality and infection rates.

This systematic review provides pooled prevalence estimates and assesses potential predictors of the nematode infections in small ruminants, i.e. helpful in planning interventions or control strategies. The review used 50 animal level datasets retrieved from 24 manuscripts. The studies used data collected from 9407 sheep and 3478 goats. A meta-analytical approach was employed to analyze Effect size (ES). The reported GI nematodes represented eleven genera affecting sheep and goats including: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia/Ostertagia, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Nematodirus, Chabertia, Trichuris, Cooperia, Skrjabinema and Oesophagostomum. The GI nematodes pooled prevalence estimate in the random effect model was 75.8% (95% CI: 69.6, 80.8). The subgroup analysis revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences in the prevalence between different regions and type of diagnostic methods used. 'Postmortem technique' and 'eastern part of the country' were associated with higher GI nematode prevalence and accounted for 68.1% of the between studies heterogeneity. In light of the high parasitic prevalence in all agro-ecologies, the need for strategic intervention is recommended.

Probiotics are viable bacteria that colonize the intestine and affect the host intestinal microbial balance. Accumulating evidence suggests that probiotic consumption may decrease the incidence of or modify RTIs. The authors systematically reviewed data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effect of probiotic consumption on RTIs in children. Methods: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were systematically searched for RCTs regarding the effect of probiotics on RTIs in children. The outcomes included number of children experienced with at least 1 RTI episode, duration of illness episodes, days of illness per subject, and school/day care absenteeism due to infection. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risks, or mean difference (MD) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: A total of 23 trials involving 6269 children were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. None of the trials showed a high risk of bias. The quality of the evidence of outcomes was moderate. The age range of subjects was from newborn to 18 years. The results of meta-analysis showed that probiotic consumption significantly decreased the number of subjects having at least 1 RTI episode (17 RCTs, 4513 children, relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96, P = 0.004). Children supplemented with probiotics had fewer numbers of days of RTIs per person compared with children who had taken a placebo (6 RCTs, 2067 children, MD -0.16, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.02, P = 0.03), and had fewer numbers of days absent from day care/school (8 RCTs, 1499 children, MD -0.94, 95% CI -1.72 to -0.15, P = 0.02). However, there was no statistically significant difference of illness episode duration between probiotic intervention group and placebo group (9 RCTs, 2817 children, MD -0.60, 95% CI -1.49 to 0.30, P = 0.19). Conclusion: Based on the available data and taking into account the safety profile of RCTs, probiotic consumption appears to be a feasible way to decrease the incidence of RTIs in children.

However concerns among clinicians exist about the efficacy of transfusion of washed cell salvage. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which patients, scheduled for all types of surgery, were randomized to washed cell salvage or to a control group with no cell salvage. Data were independently extracted, risk ratio (RR), and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Data were pooled using a random effects model. The primary endpoint was the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Results: Out of 1140 search results, a total of 47 trials were included. Overall, the use of washed cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 39% (RR = 0.61; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.65; P < 0.001), resulting in an average saving of 0.20 units of allogeneic RBC per patient (weighted mean differences [WMD] = -0.20; 95% CI -0.22 to -0.18; P < 0.001), reduced risk of infection by 28% (RR = 0.72; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.97; P = 0.03), reduced length of hospital stay by 2.31 days (WMD = -2.31; 95% CI -2.50 to -2.11; P < 0.001), but did not significantly affect risk of mortality (RR = 0.92; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.34; P = 0.66). No statistical difference could be observed in the number of patients exposed to re-operation, plasma, platelets, or rate of myocardial infarction and stroke.

Results: P. aeruginosa accounted for 19.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 17.6-21.2%) of all isolates in VAP, which was similar to the proportion in HAP of 17.8% (95% CI 14.6-21.6%), but significantly greater than the proportion in CAP of 7.7% (15/195, p < 0.001). Regarding VAP, the prevalence of P. aeruginosa has decreased since 2007. P. aeruginosa exhibited varying resistance to agents recommended for the initial management of VAP, with a high level of resistance to gentamicin (51.1%, 95% CI 37.7-64.4%) and a low level of resistance to amikacin (22.5%, 95% CI 14.3-33.6%).

Conclusions: P. aeruginosa was highly prevalent among patients with VAP and HAP in mainland China. The initial empirical treatment of these patients remains challenging because of the strikingly high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

Methods PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar and Research Gate were searched (from inception to April 2016). Primary outcome was operation time. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications (anastomotic leak, stricture, bleeding, marginal ulcer and wound infection), percent excess weight loss during one-year follow-up, reoperation, and postoperative hospital stay. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. Results Twelve trials were included comprising 13,626 patients (3309 hand-sewn vs. 6791 circular vs. 3526 linear).

To review the diagnostic accuracy of IFAT to diagnose CanL in this area with reference to its Se and Sp and elucidate the potential causes of their variations, a systematic review was conducted (31 studies for the 26-year period). Three IFAT validation methods stood out: The classical contingency table method, methods based on statistical models and those based on experimental studies. A variation in the IFAT Se and Sp values and cut-off values was observed. For the classical validation method based on a meta-Analysis, the Se of IFAT was estimated in this area as 89.86% and 31.25% in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs, respectively. The Sp of IFAT was estimated in non-endemic and endemic areas as 98.12% and 96.57%, respectively. IFAT can be considered as a good standard test in non-endemic areas for CanL, but its accuracy declines in endemic areas due to the complexity of the disease. Indeed, the accuracy of IFAT is due to the negative results obtained in non-infected dogs from non-endemic areas and to the positive results obtained in sera of symptomatic dogs living in endemic areas. But IFAT results are not unequivocal when it comes to determining CanL infection on asymptomatic dogs living in endemic areas. Statistical methods might be a solution to overcome the lack of gold standard, to better categorize groups of animals investigated, to assess optimal cut-off values and to allow a better estimate of the true prevalence aiming information on preventive/control measures for CanL. ? 2016 Adel et al.

TXA use had a significantly lower prevalence of blood transfusion (OR?=?3.14; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.67 to 5.90, P?=?0.0004) and higher hemoglobin level (MD?=??1.23; 95% CI,??2.19 to??0.27, P?=?0.01) than FS in the early postoperative period. No significant difference was seen in total blood loss between the two groups (MD?=?198.06; 95% CI,??267.45 to 663.57; P?=?0.40). There were no significant differences in adverse events, superficial infections, or deep-vein thrombosis among study groups. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that intravenous administration of TXA for patients undergoing TKA may reduce blood-transfusion requirements and maintain higher hemoglobin levels compared with topical application of FS in the early postoperative period. There were no significant differences in total calculated blood loss and prevalence of complications between the two groups. However, owing to the variation of included studies, no firm conclusions can be drawn. ? 2016 IJS Publishing Group Ltd"

The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the hospital readmissions, causes and risk factors after survival of acute stroke and TIA. Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, OVID and EMBASE databases were searched to identify studies reporting hospital readmissions after acute stroke and TIA. The primary outcomes were hospital readmission rates during 30 days and 1 year after discharge. The primary causes and risk factors of hospital readmissions were also identified. Ten studies with 253,680 patients were eligible for inclusion. The pooled 30-day and 1-year hospital readmission rates were 17.4?% (95?% CI, 12.7¡V23.5?%) and 42.5?% (95?% CI, 34.1¡V51.3?%), respectively. The three major causes of 30-day hospital readmissions were infection (19.9?%), coronary artery disease (CAD) (17.8?%) and recurrent stroke (16.0?%) successively, while the three major causes were recurrent stroke (19.4?%), infection (19.3?%) and CAD (16.3?%) during 1 year¡¦s follow-up. There were more patients with CAD in readmits group than that in control group (p?=?0.030).

Currently, surgery represents the only effective and durable therapeutic option to treat it. The first aim of the study was to estimate and compare the major surgical complications and the 30-day rate of mortality between laparoscopic and open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB and RYGB). The second aim was to evaluate the change in outcomes, complications, and deaths, with increased experience over the time period of the review. A random effect of the meta-analysis and meta-regression was used to evaluate surgical complications (i.e., reoperation, stenosis, bleeding, surgical site infection, fistula, internal hernia, and incisional ventral hernia) and the rate of mortality after LRYGB and RYGB over time. A search of literature from 2000 to 2014 led to the selection of 17 papers. When looking at surgical techniques separately, we observed a higher rate of mortality for open surgery (death rate 0.82?%, 95?% CI = 0.49¡V1.23) compared to laparoscopic surgery (death rate 0.22?%, 95?% CI = 0.09¡V0.40). This difference resulted highly significant when the two techniques were formally compared (p < 0.001). The improving of surgery technique resulted in a mean rate of mortality reduction of 0.069?%. Laparoscopy represents the approach of choice for bariatric surgery. Contemporary reports of LRYGB show low mortality rates and progressive decline in postoperative complications. Laparoscopic bariatric surgery requires advanced laparoscopic skills, and probably an extended learning curve is not accounted for by current mortality statistics. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Caesarean section can be associated with risks, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where it is not always readily available. Symphysiotomy can be an alternative treatment for obstructed labour and requires fewer resources. However, there is uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of this procedure. Objectives: To compare symphysiotomy and caesarean section for obstructed labour. Search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, African Index Medicus, Reproductive Health Library and Science Citation Index (from inception to November 2015) without language restriction. Selection criteria: Studies comparing symphysiotomy and caesarean section in all settings, with maternal and perinatal mortality as key outcomes. Data collection and analysis: Quality of the included studies was assessed using the STROBE checklist and the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Relative risks (RR) were pooled using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 tests. Main results: Seven studies (n = 1266 women), all of which were set in low- and middle-income countries (as per the World Bank definition) and compared symphysiotomy and caesarean section were identified. Meta-analyses showed no significant difference in maternal (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13¡V1.76; P = 0.27) or perinatal (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.64¡V1.96; P = 0.69) mortality with symphysiotomy when compared with caesarean section. There was a reduction in infection (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14¡V0.62) but an increase in fistulae (RR 4.19, 95% CI 1.07¡V16.39) and stress incontinence with symphysiotomy (RR 10.04, 95% CI 3.23¡V31.21). Conclusion: There was no difference in key outcomes of maternal and perinatal mortality with symphysiotomy when compared with caesarean section.

Because there remains a shortage of human organs, strict selection of transplant candidates remains of paramount importance. Recently, computed tomography (CT)-assessed low skeletal muscle mass (i.e. sarcopenia) was identified as a novel prognostic parameter to predict outcome in liver transplant candidates. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the impact of CT-assessed skeletal muscle mass on outcome in liver transplant candidates were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Nineteen studies, including 3803 patients in partly overlapping cohorts, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of sarcopenia ranged from 22.2% to 70%. An independent association between low muscle mass and posttransplantation and waiting list mortality was described in 4 of the 6 and 6 of the 11 studies, respectively. The pooled hazard ratios of sarcopenia were 1.84 (95% confidence interval 1.11¡V3.05, p = 0.02) and 1.72 (95% confidence interval 0.99¡V3.00, p = 0.05) for posttransplantation and waiting list mortality, respectively, independent of Model for End-stage Liver Disease score. Less-consistent evidence suggested a higher complication rate, particularly infections, in sarcopenic patients. In conclusion, sarcopenia is an independent predictor for outcome in liver transplantation patients and could be used for risk assessment. ?

Objectives We sought to compare the beneficial effects and adverse events associated with these therapies in treating patients with atopic dermatitis. Methods Four databases were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing topical calcineurin inhibitors versus corticosteroids in children and adults. Methodological quality was evaluated to assess bias risk. Clinical outcome and costs were compared. Results Twelve independent randomized clinical trials comparing calcineurin inhibitors (n?=?3492) versus corticosteroids (n?=?3462) were identified. Calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids had similar rates of improvement of dermatitis (81% vs 71%; risk ratio [RR] 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.34; P?=?.01) and treatment success (72% vs 68%; RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.00-1.31; P?=?.04). Calcineurin inhibitors were associated with higher costs and had more adverse events (74% vs 64%; RR 1.28; 95% CI 1.05-1.58; P?=?.02) including a higher rate of skin burning (30% vs 9%; RR 3.27; 95% CI 2.48-4.31; P?<?.00001) and pruritus (12% vs 8%; RR 1.49; 95% CI 1.24-1.79; P?<?.00001). There were no differences in atrophy, skin infections, or adverse events that were serious or required discontinuation of therapy. Limitations Only a small number of trials reported costs. Conclusion Calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids have similar efficacy. Calcineurin inhibitors are associated with higher costs and have more adverse events, such as skin burning and pruritus. These results provide level-1a support for the use of corticosteroids as the therapy of choice for atopic dermatitis. ? 2016 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc."

We calculated summary prevalence estimates for non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and ¡§Other¡¨ race/ethnicity jail detainees and prisoners and determined the proportion of anti-HCV positive persons from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Results Few studies reported anti-HCV prevalence data by race and ethnicity, and they suffered from methodologic weaknesses. Anti-HCV prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic Whites (35% [95% CI: 28%, 43%; k?= 9], compared to 26% [95% CI: 21%, 32%; k?= 10] among racial and ethnic minorities). However, the majority (63%) of persons with anti-HCV were from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds.

We aimed to identify, critically appraise and summarize the available evidence about the safety of this practice. Design: Systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Data sources: MEDLINE (via PubMed), CINALH (via EBSCO), SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Open Grey were searched from their inception to December 2015, with no language restrictions. Review methods: Epidemiologic and experimental studies assessing adverse effects of reusing needles in people of any age or sex, with or without diabetes, were included. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies using a multi-design tool. Results: In total, 25 studies were included. All studies had a high risk of bias and data from only nine studies could be pooled. Five studies showed no association between infection at site of injection and reuse of needles (risk difference = -0.00; 95% confidence interval = -0.12-0.11; P = 0.99); heterogeneity between these studies was substantial (I2 = 66%; P = 0.02). Five cross-sectional studies showed an association between lipohypertrophy and needle reuse (risk difference = 0.16, 95% confidence interval = 0.05-0.28, P = 0.006); there was strong evidence of heterogeneity between these studies (I2 = 87%; P &lt; 0.001). Pooled data of two studies with no evidence of heterogeneity between them showed more perceived pain among reusers (risk difference = 0.24; 95% confidence interval = 0.06-0.43; P = 0.006). Reusing a pen needle or disposable syringe-needle was not associated with worse glycaemic control. Conclusions: There is currently no clear scientific evidence to suggest for or against the reuse of needles for subcutaneous insulin injection. This practice is very common among people with diabetes; consequently, further research is necessary to establish its safety. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

Method: MEDLINE (1950-March 2015), EMBASE (1947-March 2015) and PubMED (1966-March 2015) were searched for studies where an IT intervention involving any device (e.g. computer, mobile phone) was evaluated in practice. All papers were assessed for quality using a 10-point rating scale. Results: We identified 45 articles that evaluated an IT intervention to improve antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals. IT interventions took four main forms: (1) stand-alone computerized decision support systems (CDSSs), (2) decision support embedded within a hospital's electronic medical record (EMR) or computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, (3) computerized antimicrobial approval systems (cAAS), and (4) surveillance systems (SSs). Results reported allowed us to perform meta-analyses for three outcome measures: appropriate use of antimicrobials, patient mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS). IT interventions increased appropriate use of antimicrobials (pooled RR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.07-2.08); however no evidence of an effect was found when analysis included only studies with a quality score of five or above on the 10-point quality scale (pooled RR: 1.53, 95%CI: 0.96-2.44). There was little evidence of an effect of IT interventions on patient mortality or LOS. The range of study designs and outcome measures prevented meaningful comparisons between different IT intervention types to be made. Conclusion: IT interventions can improve the appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing. However, high quality, systematic multi-site comparative studies are critically needed to assist organizations in making informed decisions about the most effective IT interventions. ? 2016."

Methods: Medline In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial were searched from inception to February 2016. Reviewers extracted data and assessed methodological quality in duplicate. Results: We included 32 observational studies reporting on 2174 patients (39.4% women, mean age 59.8 years) undergoing 2190 adrenal mass biopsy procedures. Pathology was described in 1621/2190 adrenal lesions (689 metastases, 68 adrenocortical carcinomas, 64 other malignancies, 464 adenomas, 226 other benign, 36 pheochromocytomas, and 74 others). The pooled non-diagnostic rate (30 studies, 2013 adrenal biopsies) was 8.7% (95%CI: 6-11%). The pooled complication rate (25 studies, 1339 biopsies) was 2.5% (95%CI: 1.5-3.4%). Studies were at a moderate risk for bias. Most limitations related to patient selection, assessment of outcome, and adequacy of follow-up. Only eight studies (240 patients) could be included in the diagnostic performance analysis with a sensitivity and specificity of 87 and 100% for malignancy, 70 and 98% for adrenocortical carcinoma, and 87 and 96% for metastasis respectively. Conclusions: Evidence based on small sample size and moderate risk of bias suggests that adrenal biopsy appears to be most useful in the diagnosis of adrenal metastasis in patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy. Adrenal biopsy should only be performed if the expected findings are likely to alter the management of the individual patient and after biochemical exclusion of catecholamine-producing tumors to help prevent potentially life-threatening complications. ? 2016 European Society of Endocrinology Published by Bioscientifica Ltd."

Methods This systematic review was conducted to provide up to date evidence for Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (CTFPHC) lung cancer screening guidelines. Four databases were searched to March 31, 2015 along with utilizing a previous Cochrane review search. Randomized trials reporting benefits were included; any design was included for harms. Meta-analyses were performed if possible. PROSPERO #CRD42014009984. Results Thirty-four studies were included. For lung cancer mortality there was no benefit of CXR screening, with or without SC. Pooled results from three small trials comparing LDCT to usual care found no significant benefits for lung cancer mortality. One large high quality trial showed statistically significant reductions of 20% in lung cancer mortality over a follow-up of 6.5 years, for LDCT compared with CXR. LDCT screening was associated with: overdiagnosis of 10.99¡V25.83%; 11.18 deaths and 52.03 patients with major complications per 1000 undergoing invasive follow-up procedures; median estimate for false positives of 25.53% for baseline/once-only screening and 23.28% for multiple rounds; and 9.74 and 5.28 individuals per 1000 screened, with benign conditions underwent minor and major invasive follow-up procedures. Conclusion The evidence does not support CXR screening with or without sputum cytology for lung cancer. High quality evidence showed that in selected high-risk individuals, LDCT screening significantly reduced lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality. However, for its implementation at a population level, the current evidence warrants the development of standardized practices for screening with LDCT and follow-up invasive testing to maximize accuracy and reduce potential associated harms. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The aim of this study was to compare outcomes between pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level and conventional pedicle screw fixation (one level above and one level below the fracture level) for thoracolumbar (TL) fractures. Methods: A meta-analysis of cohort studies was conducted between pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level (combined screw group) and conventional pedicle screw fixation (conventional group) for the treatment of TL fractures from their inception to December 2015. An extensive search of studies was performed in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane library. The following outcome measures were extracted: visual analogue scale (VAS), operation time and intraoperative blood loss, Cobb angle and anterior vertebral height (AVH), and complications. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3.5. Results: From 10 relevant studies identified, 283 patients undergoing pedicle screw fixation combined with intermediate screw at the fracture level were compared with 285 conventional pedicle screw procedures.

Outcome measures included blood loss, drainage volume, total complications, seroma, necrosis, wound infections, ecchymosis, hematoma, hospital length of stay, and operating time. Risk of bias was analyzed for all studies. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models for mean differences of continuous variables and a fixed-effects model for risk ratios of dichotomous variables. Results: Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. Across surgery types, compared to conventional techniques, Harmonic technology reduced total complications by 52% (P=0.002), seroma by 46% (P<0.0001), necrosis by 49% (P=0.04), postoperative chest wall drainage by 46% (P=0.0005), blood loss by 38% (P=0.0005), and length of stay by 22% (P=0.007). Although benefits generally appeared greatest in mastectomy patients with lymph node dissection, Harmonic technology showed significant reductions in complications in the BCS study subgroup. Conclusion: In this meta-analysis of both mastectomy and BCS procedures, the use of Harmonic technology reduced the risk of most complications by about half across breast cancer surgery patients. These benefits may be due to superior hemostatic capabilities of Harmonic technology and better dissection, particularly lymph node dissection. Reduction in complications and other resource outcomes may engender lower downstream health care costs. ? 2016 Cheng et al."

We systematically reviewed the literatures to determine whether any clinical benefits exist for piperacillin/tazobactam by extended or continuous infusion. Methods - A search of PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Cochrane, Embase and related ICAAC and ACCP conferences were conducted up to September 5, 2015. Randomized controlled and observational studies that compared extended or continuous infusion with conventional intermittent infusion of piperacillin/tazobactam were identified from the databases above and analyzed. Two reviewers independently evaluated the methodology and extracted data from primary studies. A meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.2 software. The quality of each study was assessed. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were evaluated. Results - Three randomized controlled trials and twelve observational studies were included in this study. All included studies had high quality and no publication bias was found. Compared to the conventional intermittent infusion approach, the extended or continuous infusion group had a significant cost effectiveness (OR -0.89.02, CI (-114.69,-63.35), P<0.00001). No statistical difference was observed for clinical cure rate (OR 1.64, 95% CI (0.88, 3.30), P=0.12) between the two dosing regimens. The sensitivity analysis showed the results were stable. Conclusions - Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that the outcomes associated with alternative dosing strategies of piperacillin/tazobactam have changed compared with conclusions before for several literatures with large samples published. Further data on the outcomes should be generated for a better understanding of the extended or continuous infusion strategy. On the whole, our meta-analysis suggested that the extended or continuous infusion should be recommended for clinical use only considering its economic advantage, but there was no significantly higher clinical cure rate and lower mortality rate compared with the conventional intermittent infusion."

This review aimed to explore the associations between the psychological health of FSWs and HIV risk. A total of eight studies published in English before July 2013 were identified and reviewed. FSWs had reported psychological issues, including depression, suicidal thoughts as well as lower quality of life, and the pooled prevalence of probable depression was as high as 62.4%. The majority of studies showed that higher scores in psychological health problems were associated with increased HIV risk behavior, in particular inconsistent condom use, or sexually transmitted infections. Among the five studies which measured symptoms of depression, four documented that higher depression scores were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use among FSWs with their clients and/or partners. Meta-analysis using a fixed-effects model was performed to examine the association between depression and inconsistent condom use and found that higher scores in depression were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use (odds ratio = 2.57, p <.001). This review contends that future HIV preventive interventions should take psychological health of FSWs into consideration. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis."

Twelve trials with 1236 patients were identified. Adjuvant treatment with YPFF significantly increased serum levels of IgA (weighted mean difference [WMD] 0.33 mg/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20 to 0.45), IgG (WMD 1.36 mg/mL; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65), IgM (WMD 0.16 mg/mL; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.31), and CD3+ T-lymphocytes (WMD 10.16%; 95% CI 4.62 to 15.69) but not CD4+ T-lymphocytes (WMD 3.16%; 95% CI ?0.27 to 6.59) and CD8+ T-lymphocytes (WMD ?0.84%; 95% CI ?2.50 to 0.81). YPFF also reduced the frequency of RRTIs (WMD ?3.80 times; 95% CI ?4.86 to ?2.74) and increased total effective rates of symptom improvement (risk ratio: 1.44; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.75).

Material and Methods: Our objective was to assess the efficacy of prophylactic amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid in reducing the incidence of dry socket and/or infection after third molar extraction. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis consulting electronic databases and references in retrieved articles. We included double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials published up to June 2015 investigating the efficacy of amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid on the incidence of the aforementioned conditions after third molar extraction. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated with a generic inverse-variance approach and a random effect model using Stata/IC 13 and Review Manager Version 5.2. Stratified analysis was performed by antibiotic type. Results: We included 10 papers in the qualitative review and in the quantitative synthesis (1997 extractions: 1072 in experimental groups and 925 in controls, with 27 and 74 events of dry socket and/or infection, respectively). The overall RR was 0.350 (p<0.001; 95% CI 0.214 to 0.574). We found no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%, p=0.470). The number needed to treat was 18 (95% CI 13 to 29). Five studies reported adverse reactions (RR=1.188, 95% CI 0.658 to 2.146, p =0.567). The RRs were 0.563 for amoxicillin (95% CI 0.295 to 1.08, p=0.082) and 0.215 for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (95% CI 0.117 to 0.395, p<0.001). Conclusions: Prophylactic use of amoxicillin does not significantly reduce the risk of infection and/or dry socket after third molar extraction. With amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, the risk decreases significantly. Nevertheless, considering the number needed to treat, low prevalence of infection, potential adverse reactions to antibiotics and lack of serious complications in placebo groups, the routine prescription of amoxicillin with or without clavulanic acid is not justified. ?

This study aimed to investigate the association between human papillomavirus (HPV) Types 16 and 18 and esophageal carcinoma (EC) in the world population by conducting a meta-analysis. Materials and Methods Computerized bibliographic and manual searches were performed to identify all eligible literatures between 1982 and 2014. PUBMED (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and CNKI (http://www.cnki.net/) were the primary sources of case-control studies, and key words used include human papillomavirus, HPV, esophageal, esophagus, cancer, carcinoma, and tumor. All searches were performed by reviewing articles and abstracts cited in the published systematic reviews and case-control studies. Prospective studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% CIs for the association between HPV and EC were included. Results Thirty-three randomized studies were identified, and the main features of these trials were included in this systematic review. HPV infection rate in the EC group was 46.5%, while HPV infection rate in the control group was 26.2% (OR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.33-1.98). In China, the merger OR value was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26-2.07); while in the Asian region, the merger OR value was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.29-2.04). There were statistical differences in HPV testing due to different detection methods such as PCR, IHC and ISH. In the PCR detection group, the merger OR value was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.33-1.95). Conclusions These results indicate that HPV infection and the incidence of EC are closely associated. ? 2016 Wang et al.

However, the evidence cited for this guidance is limited. We aimed to review local data and the existing literature to identify evidence to either support or refute this guidance. Method We retrospectively reviewed 3years of urine cultures from our outpatient prolonged jaundice clinic. We then conducted literature review with meta-analysis of studies presenting original data on urine tract infection (UTI) rates in jaundiced and prolonged jaundiced babies. Results From our local data, none of the 279 patients met our unit clinical criteria for UTI. Literature review revealed considerable differences worldwide in UTI rates in both jaundiced and prolonged jaundiced cases. Using pooled data from our literature review and our local population, the incidence of UTI in prolonged jaundiced babies is 0.21% (95% CI 0.0% to 0.73%) in the UK. This is significantly lower than the figure indicated from the data from elsewhere in the world, 8.21% (95% CI 4.36% to 13.0%). Conclusions The findings both from our local data and the current literature do not support the practice of routine screening for urine infection in well babies with prolonged jaundice. In view of the above, we no longer include urine culture in screening of well infants with prolonged jaundice.

Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan neglected parasitic infection that can lead to severe complications including death in immune-compromised patients or following infection in utero. Multiple studies have demonstrated the transmission of Toxoplasma gondii by blood transfusion. The objective of this review was to comprehensively assess the seroprevalence rate of Toxoplasma in blood donors from a worldwide perspective. Seven electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, Ovid, and Google Scholar) were searched using medical subject headings terms. A total of 43 records met the inclusion criteria in which 20,964 donors were tested during the period from January 1980 to June 2015. The overall weighted prevalence of exposure to toxoplasmosis in blood donors was 33% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28%-39%). The seroprevalences of immunoglobulin (Ig)M and both IgG and IgM antibodies were 1.8% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.4%) and 1.1% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.8%), respectively. The highest and the lowest seroprevalences of toxoplasmosis were observed in Africa (46%; 95% CI, 14%-78%) and in Asia (29%; 95% CI, 23%-35%), respectively. Brazil (75%) and Ethiopia (73%) were identified as countries with high seroprevalence. Because positive serology does not imply infectiousness and because seroprevalence is high in some nations, a positive serology test result alone cannot be used as an effective method for donor screening. Future research for methods to prevent transfusion-transmitted toxoplasmosis may derive benefit from studies conducted in areas of high endemicity. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

The noninferiority of laparoscopic versus open techniques has already been established in D2 resections. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of open and laparoscopic approaches for ELTs in colon cancer. Method: Major databases, including PubMed, Scopus and the Cochrane library, were searched using defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and relevant data were extracted. The Cochrane and Newcastle¡VOttawa tools were used for critical appraisal and quality assessment. Meta-analysis with various subgroup analyses were undertaken, and clinical and statistical heterogeneity, along with publication bias, were also assessed. Results: One randomized and seven case¡Vcontrol trials were included. All studies were found to be of low methodological quality with some external validity issues.

After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 12 articles were included in the study. Results and Discussion: Coronectomy results in significantly lesser loss of sensitivity of the inferior alveolar nerve and prevents the occurrence of dry socket. No statistically significant differences were observed in the incidence of pain and infection between coronectomy and complete surgical extraction. After coronectomy, the remaining tooth fragment migrates an average of 2 mm within two years. Conclusions: Coronectomy is indicated when the mandibular third molar is in contact with the inferior alveolar nerve and complete removal of the tooth may cause nerve damage. ? Medicina Oral S. L."

Three out of the five studies that reported on nasal colonization showed significant ORs varying from 1.73 (95?% CI 1.16¡V2.58) to 14.64 (95?% CI 2.82¡V75.95). For acne one of the three studies that evaluated skin colonization reported a significant OR of 4.16 (95?% CI 1.74¡V9.94). A relation between nasal colonization and acne was not found. Limitations in study design and low sample sizes should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results. Colonisation with S. aureus seems to be increased in patients with psoriasis. This bacterial species, known for its potential to induce long-lasting inflammation, might be involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. Information on acne is limited. Prospective controlled studies should further investigate the role of S. aureus in chronic inflammatory skin diseases. ? 2016, The Author(s)."

Waterbirth is increasing in popularity, despite uncertainty regarding its safety for neonates. This systematic review and meta-analysis appraises the existing evidence for neonatal outcomes following waterbirth. Methods: A structured electronic database search was performed with no language restrictions. All comparative studies which reported neonatal outcomes following waterbirth, and that were published since 1995, were included. Quality appraisal was performed using a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Programme scoring system. The primary outcome was neonatal mortality. Data for each neonatal outcome were tabulated and analysed. Meta-analysis was performed for comparable studies which reported sufficient data. Results: The majority of the 29 included studies were small, with limited follow-up and methodological flaws. They were mostly conducted in Europe and high-income countries. Reporting of data was heterogeneous. No significant difference in neonatal mortality, neonatal intensive care unit/special care baby unit admission rate, Apgar scores, umbilical cord gases or infection rates was found between babies delivered into water and on land. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis did not identify definitive evidence that waterbirth causes harm to neonates compared with land birth. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude that there are no additional risks or benefits for neonates when comparing waterbirth and conventional delivery on land. ? 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and other bibliographic databases for studies published until 30 September 2015 that described circulatory cathodic antigen testing compared against one to three Kato¡VKatz tests per subject ¡V for Schistosoma mansoni ¡V or the filtration of one 10-ml urine sample per subject ¡V for S. haematobium. We extracted the numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives for the antigen testing and performed meta-analyses using a bivariate hierarchical regression model. Findings Twenty-six studies published between 1994 and 2014 met the inclusion criteria. In the detection of S. mansoni, a single antigen test gave a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.84¡V0.94) and a pooled specificity of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.39¡V0.71; n = 7) when compared against a single Kato¡VKatz test. The corresponding values from comparisons with two to three Kato¡VKatz tests per subject were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.80¡V0.88) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53¡V0.76; n = 14), respectively. There appeared to be no advantage in using three antigen tests per subject instead of one. When compared against the results of urine filtration, antigen testing for S. haematobium showed poor sensitivity and poor specificity. The performance of antigen testing was better in areas of high endemicity than in settings with low endemicity.

This study aimed to evaluate and compare the safety and diagnostic value of brain biopsy in HIV patients in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) versus post-HAART era via metaanalysis. Appropriate studies were identified per search criteria. The local database was retrospectively reviewed to select a similar patient cohort. Patient demographics, brain biopsy technique, histopathology and patient outcomes were extracted from each study. Study-specific outcomes were combined per random-effects model. Outcomes were compared between the pre-HAART and post-HAART era. Correlations between outcomes and baseline characteristics were assessed via metaregression analysis. The proportions of histopathological diagnosis were tabulated and compared between the pre- and post-HAART era. Survival analysis was performed for patients in the post-HAART era. A total of 26 studies (including the local database) with 1209 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The most common indications for brain biopsy were diagnosis unlikely to be toxoplasmosis (n=8, 42.1%), focal brain lesion (n=5, 26.3%) or both (n=3, 15.8%). The weighted proportions for diagnostic success were 92% (95% CI 90.0% to 93.8%), change in management 57.7% (45.9% to 69.1%) and clinical improvement 36.6% (26.3% to 47.5%). Morbidity and mortality were 5.7% (3.6% to 8.3%) and 0.9% (0.3% to 1.9%), respectively. Diagnostic success rate was significantly higher in the post-HAART than the pre-HAART era (97.5% vs 91.9%, p=0.047). The odds ratio (OR) for diagnostic success in patients with contrast-enhanced lesions was 2.54 ((1.25 to 5.15), p<0.01). The median survival for HIV patients who underwent biopsy in the post-HAART era was 225 days (90-2446). Brain biopsy in HIV patients is safe with high diagnostic yield.

Study design A systematic review using narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Methods MedLine, PsycINFO, PubMed Central, Scopus and CINAHL were searched. Data were extracted with the use of spread sheet. An analysis of heterogeneity was performed for the disclosure rate and the presence of a supportive reaction from partners. A meta-analysis was performed for the disclosure rates to sexual partners, with data available for all ten studies. Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. The outcomes show that HIV disclosure of sero-positive status is most common between spouses or sexual partners than disclosure to relatives/family members, friends, pastor/Imam or work colleagues/employers. The participants in most of these studies are women, and amongst the most influential factors on disclosure are gender, anticipated outcome, marital status and knowledge of partners¡¦ status. Some studies reported non-disclosure as a way of limiting stigma. Almost all of the studies highlighted that there is fear of stigma and social exclusion associated with disclosure. Conclusion This review discusses the overall experience of HIV disclosure on the management of the disease and barriers to disclosure. We found that PLWHA in Nigeria disclosed to at least one person within their social networks. Stigma is still a major consideration for PLWHA who experience a range of misconceptions around HIV transmission. The findings of this study may inform local policies and plans for improving the PLWHA quality of life. Targeted policies to increase disclosure of sero-positive status and reduce stigma may facilitate disease prevention.

Materials and Methods: Eligible studies were identified by 2 reviewers using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. Outcomes included stone-free rate after the first and the final SWL session, the mean number of shocks per SWL session, the mean percentage of power used in the first SWL session, and the mean number of SWL sessions per patient. Results: Pooled data among the 647 included patients showed that supine SWL was associated with a significantly higher stone-free rate than prone SWL. This difference was consistent for both the first SWL session (OR 4.17; 95% CI 2.53-6.87; p < 0.00001) and the final session (OR 3.02; 95% CI 1.96-4.67; p < 0.00001).

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for eligible studies. All published randomized controlled trials comparing operative with nonoperative treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures were eligible. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan, version 5.0, software. Seven studies assessing 824 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to the functional results. The incidence of complications was 25.0% (80 of 319) in the operative group and 16.6% (55 of 330) in the nonoperative group (relative risk 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 2.08; p?=?.006) with a significant difference. The rate of subtalar arthrodesis was significantly lower in the operative group than in the nonoperative group. The current evidence is still insufficient to ascertain whether operative treatment is superior to nonoperative treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. Operative treatment can reduce the risk of late subtalar arthrodesis but is associated with a greater risk of complications. The small sample size and the great heterogeneity of the included studies made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding some of the combined results. Furthermore, more high-quality, randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-up data on this issue are required to provide evidence for surgeons to make an informed decision. ? 2016 American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy, the operative time consumption, the amount of intraoperative blood loss, time of pedicle insertion and the incidence of complications of thoracic pedicle screw placement in patients with thoracic diseases such as scoliosis and kyphosis. Pubmed, Web of Knowledge, and Google scholar were searched to identify comparative studies of thoracic pedicle screw placement between intraoperative computer navigation and fluoroscopy-guided navigation. Outcomes of malposition rate, operative time consumption, insertion time, intraoperative blood loss, and the incidence of complications are evaluated. Fourteen articles including 1723 patients and 9019 PSs were identified matching inclusion criteria. The malposition rate was lower (RR: 0.33, 95?% CI: 0.28¡V0.38, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group; the operative time was significantly longer [weighted mean difference (WMD) = 23.66, 95?% CI: 14.74¡V32.57, P < 0.01] in computer navigation group than that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group. The time of insertion was shorter (WMD = ?1.88, 95?% CI: ?2.25¡V ?1.52, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that in fluoroscopy-guided navigation group. The incidence of complications was lower (RR = 0. 23, 95?% CI: 0.12¡V0.46, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that in the other group. The intraoperative blood loss was fewer (WMD = ?167.49, 95?% CI: ?266.39¡V ?68.58, P < 0.01) in computer navigation group than that in the other.

However, it is unclear whether there are differences between plate fixation and intramedullary fixation regarding complications and functional outcome. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare plate fixation and intramedullary fixation for midshaft clavicle fractures. Methods: The Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for both randomized controlled trials and observational studies. The methodologic quality of all included studies was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Results: Twenty studies were included. Ten of the 20 included studies used a fracture classification. Seven of these studies reported exclusion of patients with comminuted fractures. No difference in the total re-intervention rate was found (odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 2.04).

Although in the early stage of research and development, NOTES has been clinically applied across the globe, above all the transvaginal cholecystectomy is among the most frequently performed procedures. In the existing 2 types of transvaginal routes, the hybrid NOTES cholecystectomy (NC) is more likely to be accepted. However, there has been controversy regarding the safety outcomes of hybrid NC in comparison with classical laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The primary objective of this meta-analysis is to compare the characteristics between NC and classical LC. Materials and Methods: A meta-analysis of eligible studies comparing NC with classical LC was performed to evaluate the safety outcomes including wound complications, other postoperative complications and intraoperative conversion between the 2 groups. Results: Pooling 3 randomized controlled trials (n=157) and 7 nonrandomized trial (n=593) demonstrated that the rates of wound complications and other postoperative complications in NC group did not significantly differ from those of classical LC group [wound complications: ratio difference (RD)=-0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.04to 0.01, P=0.23; other postoperative complication: RD=-0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02; P=0.6]. The intraoperative conversion rate in NC groups was higher than that of LC groups (RD=0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.06; P=0.02). Conclusions: There is no significate difference between the safety of NC and laparoscope cholecystectomy. NC is associated with a higher rate of intraoperative conversion when compared with LC.

They have the poorest health, economic and social outcomes. Higher notification rates of hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV) have been reported among Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal people. The identification of Aboriginal people in national surveillance has some weaknesses, with only four of the eight jurisdictions included in national reporting. To address some of these limitations, we aim to estimate the pooled prevalence of anti-HCV among Aboriginal people in Australia. Evidence Acquisition: We searched the databases: Pubmed,Web of Science and Informit, and the New SouthWales and Northern Territory Public Health Bulletins. A study was included if it reported the number of Aboriginal people testing positive for anti-HCV and the number tested for anti-HCV. A meta-analysis by population-group was conducted if three or more studies reported a prevalence estimate. Variables included: author, year of publication, study design, study period, gender (female, male), age, population group (Aboriginal people in prison, Aboriginal people who inject drugs), number testing anti-HCV positive, number tested for anti-HCV and prevalence (%). Due to a long time period, we separated the studies estimating the prevalence anti-HCV among Aboriginal people in prison into two time periods, 1994 - 2004 and 2005 - 2012. Results: Overall, 15 studies met our inclusion criteria. Among Aboriginal people in prison, the pooled prevalence of anti-HCV was 18.1% (95%CI: 6.6 - 29.7). The pooled prevalence among Aboriginal people in prison was 25.7% (95%CI: 4.1-47.3) in studies published between 1994 - 2004 and 14.5% (95%CI: 1.7 - 27.3) in studies published from 2005 - 2012. The pooled prevalence of anti-HCV was 58.7% (95%CI: 53.9 - 63.5)amongAboriginal peoplewhoinject drugs and 2.9% (95%CI: 0.30 - 6.1)amongAboriginal peoplewhodid not inject drugs, however there was significant heterogeneity (I2 > 90.0%, P < 0.01). There was significant selection bias in the studies as most included individuals who inject drugs. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the overall prevalence of anti-HCV was significantly biased towards people who inject drugs; resulting in an over-estimation of anti-HCV prevalence among Aboriginal people. Our review highlights that unsafe injecting is the main transmission route for HCV infection among Aboriginal people in Australia. ? 2016, Kowsar Corp."

Only articles investigating SSI impact and risk factors in Sub-Saharan African countries were retained. Results: Out of 95 articles found, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Only 9 countries out of 45 have contributed, with a huge amount of information coming from Nigeria (5 articles out of 11). The impact of SSI ranged from 6.8% to 26% with predominance in general surgery. The pooled incidence of SSI was 14.8% (95% CI: 15,5-16,2%) with significant heterogeneity according to the specialty and the method of monitoring. Most cited risk factors were long procedure length and categories 3 and 4 of Altemeier contamination class. Other factors included hospital environment, inadequate care practices and underlying pathologies. Conclusion: SSI incidence is high in Sub-Saharan Africa. Studies in this area could improve knowledge, prevention and control of these multiple risk factors. ? Ngaroua et al."

In this article, we propose that meta-analysis, when properly conducted and reported in the context of a rigorous systematic review, is an indispensable tool for synthesis and interpretation of clinical evidence for the purpose of informing clinical decision-making by clinicians, patients and health care policy makers. Meta-analysis provides many benefits, including enhanced precision and statistical power, greater transparency, identification of bias, exploration of heterogeneity of effects, enhanced generalizability, efficient integration of clinical knowledge, identification of evidence gaps, better informed future trial design and avoidance of unnecessary research duplication and potential patient harm. The overall standard, clinical value and reach of meta-analysis has been further enhanced by the development of standards for registration, conduct and reporting, as well as advanced meta-analytic techniques, such as network meta-analysis. Of course, meta-analysis can at times be limited by poor quality studies, trial heterogeneity, publication bias and non-rigorous review and analysis, although through appraisal these issues are often able to be identified and explored, such that valuable clinical information can still be obtained. Consequently, meta-analysis is now the most highly cited form of research and is considered by many leading organizations to represent the highest level of clinical evidence. However, to maximize their considerable value, it is essential that all clinicians have the skills to critically appraise, carefully interpret and judiciously apply meta-analyses in their practice. ? 2016 The Author 2016.

Seven electronic databases and relevant resources were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients using noninvasive ventilation at PIC window with those continuing receiving invasive ventilation. Retrieved citations were screened, risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted by 2 independent review authors. Overall effect sizes were synthesized by using meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated by using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 17 trials involving 959 participants were included for this review. Compared with continuous invasive ventilation, noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window significantly reduced mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. Of these, mortality significantly decreased (risk ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.17-0.42, P&lt;0.001) without significant heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.99). Quality of evidence regarding the 9 outcomes across the included studies was rated from moderate to low. Use of noninvasive ventilation at PIC window showed beneficial effects across identified trials for ARF in AECOPD patients. Considering the absence of high quality of available evidence and the uncertainty of long-term effect of this intervention, a weak recommendation for clinical practice was generated, and further well-designed and adequately powered RCTs are required to validate this conclusion. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of S-1 with 5-FU in AGC. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing S-1 with 5-FU for AGC were eligible. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.2. Seven trials involving 2443 patients were included. Compared with 5-FU, S-1 showed no significant prolongation of overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.83-1.01], P=0.07) and progression-free survival (HR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.70-1.13], P=0.35), but longer time to treatment failure (HR=0.74, 95% CI [0.56-0.97], P=0.03). The objective response rates were comparable (risk ratio [RR] = 1.36, 95% CI [0.95, 1.96], P=0.10). Regarding treatment-related deaths and hematological toxicities, there was significant heterogeneity between Asian and non-Asian trials, and subgroup analysis was applied. In Asian patients, there was a significant increase in hematological toxicities such as leukopenia (grade 1-4: RR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.08, 1.37], P=0.001; grade 3-4: RR = 2.21, 95% CI [1.52, 3.21], P<0.0001), neutropenia (grade 1-4: RR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.11, 1.48], P=0.0005; grade 3-4: RR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.11, 3.17], P=0.02), and thrombocytopenia (grade 1-4: RR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.22, 2.41], P = 0.002) in S-1-containing regimens compared with 5-FU-containing regimens, but without significant difference in treatmentrelated mortality rate (risk difference [RD] = 0.00, 95% CI [?0.01, 0.01], P=0.68). In non-Asian patients, S-1-containing regimens were, however, associated with significantly fewer treatment-related deaths (RD = ?0.02, 95% CI [?0.05, ?0.00], P=0.04), as well as less all grade 1-4 and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities except anemia. There was no significant heterogeneity in nonhematologic toxicities between Asian and non-Asian trials. Lower incidence of grade 1-4 nausea, diarrhea, mucositis, grade 3-4 mucositis, increased creatinine, and decreased calculated creatinine clearance was observed in S-1-containing regimens. S-1 could not improve OS, but increase some hematological toxicities in Asian patients. Therefore, special attention on hematological toxicities should be paid to Asian patients because S-1 is administered on an outpatient basis. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

At present, there still are 9.3 million chronic HBV-infected Chinese. Numerous studies have explored the association between possible factors and hepatocellular carcinoma risk, however, the results remains inconsistent. Therefore, we did this pooled analysis so as to get a precise result. Here, we took the chronic HBV-infected Chinese as the object. We systematically searched for studies evaluating whether the proposed factors changed HCC risk in PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP database and Wanfang data. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by Review Manager 5.0 and publication bias was determined by Begg¡¦s test and Egger¡¦s test. In total, 3165 cases and 10,896 controls from 27 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Our results showed that pooled OR with 95% CI for each of the factors investigated were: non-antiviral treatment 2.70 (2.01, 3.62), high HBV DNA levels 2.61 (1.73, 3.94), alcohol consumption 2.19 (1.53, 3.13), a family history of HCC 3.58 (2.53, 5.06) and male gender 2.14 (1.68, 2.73), respectively. Our meta-analysis supports that high HBV DNA levels, non-antiviral treatment, alcohol consumption, a family history of HCC and male gender contributed to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV-infected Chinese from currently available evidence. Given the high prevalence of the non-antiviral treatment and alcohol drinking, behavior interventions for the two factors should be tackled first. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

The findings of the individual studies are inconclusive. A systematic review was conducted to synthesize evidence on the association of STH infection with the prevalence and density of Plasmodium falciparum infection, and its effect on anaemia among children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Methods: Relevant studies published before March 6, 2015 were identified by searching Medline (via Pubmed), Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL without any language restriction. Studies on P. falciparum and STH co-infection among children in SSA except for case studies were included in this study. Studies were screened for eligibility and data extracted independently by two authors. The primary outcome assessed was the prevalence of P. falciparum infection and the secondary outcomes included P. falciparum density and prevalence of anaemia. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q and Moran's I 2 and publication bias was evaluated using Egger test. A random-effects model was used to estimate the summary odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of 2985 articles screened, 11 articles were included in the systematic review; of these seven were considered in the meta-analysis. Of the 11 studies with 7458 study participants, seven were cross-sectional, one prospective cohort and three were randomized controlled trials. Four studies examined the outcome for hookworms, one for Ascaris lumbricoides and six for pooled (at least one) STH species. Eight studies measured prevalence/incidence of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection, two calculated prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection, three evaluated P. falciparum density and four considered prevalence of P. falciparum infection related anaemia/mean haemoglobin reduction. The odds of asymptomatic/uncomplicated P. falciparum infection were higher among children infected with STH than those uninfected with intestinal helminths (summary Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.4; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.05-1.87; I 2 = 36.8 %). Plasmodium falciparum density tended to be higher among children infected with STH than those uninfected with intestinal helminths. However, STH infection was associated with lower odds of P. falciparum infection related anaemia (summary OR: 0.5; 95 % CI: 0.21-0.78; I 2 = 43.3 %). Conclusions: The findings suggest that STH infection may increase susceptibility to asymptomatic/uncomplicated P. falciparum infection but may protect malaria-related anaemia in children. Future studies should investigate the effect of STH infection upon the incidence of severe P. falciparum infection among children in SSA. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

However, whether this decline in proportion of cancers positive for HPV16/18 is consistently observed across studies remains to be elucidated. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify papers reporting data on age-specific prevalence of HPV16/18 in cervical cancer and to summarize the results. We employed MEDLINE and Embase for a systematic literature search and thereby identified a total of 644 papers published in the period 1999-2015, of which 15 papers, reporting cross-sectional data, were included for review (11,526 cervical cancers). The prevalence of HPV16/18 in cervical cancer declined significantly with age (£l = -0.83, p = 0.04) from 74.8% (95% CI 67.6-80.8) in women aged 30-39 years to 56.8% (95% CI 43.9-68.8) in women aged ?70 years. As the HPV16/18 positive cancers are prevented in fully vaccinated cohorts, the age-specific epidemiology of cervical cancer is anticipated to change, with a shift in peak incidence rate to older ages. It will be important for integrated vaccination and screening strategies to consider predicted change in the age-specific epidemiology of cervical cancer. ? 2015 UICC."

Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies assessing the prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected individuals in Africa and extracted data on laboratory methods used. Prevalence estimates from individual studies were combined for each country using random-effects meta-analysis. The importance of study design, population and setting as well as type of test (anti-HCV antibody tests and polymerase chain reactions) was examined with meta-regression. Results: Three randomized controlled trials, 28 cohort studies and 121 cross-sectional analyses with 108,180 HIV-infected individuals from 35 countries were included. The majority of data came from outpatient populations (55%), followed by blood donors (15%) and pregnant women (14%). Based on estimates from 159 study populations, anti-HCV positivity prevalence ranged between 3.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-4.7) in Southern Africa and 42.3% (95% CI 4.1-80.5) in North Africa. Study design, type of setting and age distribution did not influence this prevalence significantly. The prevalence of replicating HCV infection, estimated from data of 29 cohorts, was 2.0% (95% CI 1.5-2.6). Ten studies from nine countries reported the HCV genotype of 74 samples, 53% were genotype 1, 24% genotype 2, 14% genotype 4 and 9% genotypes 3, 5 or 6. Conclusions: The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies is high in HIV-infected patients in Africa, but replicating HCV infection is rare and varies widely across countries. ?2016 Azevedo TCL et al."

Purpose: To evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of monotherapy (thiazolidinediones, metformin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT-2] inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists) and selected metformin-based combinations in adults with type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: English-language studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, indexed from inception through March 2015 (MEDLINE search updated through December 2015). Study Selection: Paired reviewers independently identified 179 trials and 25 observational studies of head-to-head monotherapy or metformin-based combinations. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently assessed study quality and serially extracted data and graded the strength of evidence. Data Synthesis: Cardiovascular mortality was lower for metformin versus sulfonylureas; the evidence on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and microvascular complications was insufficient or of low strength. Reductions in hemoglobin A1c values were similar across monotherapies and metformin-based combinations, except that DPP-4 inhibitors had smaller effects. Body weight was reduced or maintained with metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors and increased with sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin (between-group differences up to 5 kg). Hypoglycemia was more frequent with sulfonylureas. Gastrointestinal adverse events were highest with metformin and GLP-1 receptor agonists. Genital mycotic infections were increased with SGLT-2 inhibitors. Limitation: Most studies were short, with limited ability to assess rare safety and long-term clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The evidence supports metformin as first-line therapy for type 2 diabetes, given its relative safety and beneficial effects on hemoglobin A1c, weight, and cardiovascular mortality (compared with sulfonylureas). On the basis of less evidence, results for add-on therapies to metformin were similar to those for monotherapies."

In order to reach this goal, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the seroprevalence rate of T. gondii infection among Iranian pregnant women population to achieve a comprehensive explanation of the disease condition in Iran for future use. English electronic databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Ovid and Cochrane) and Persian language databases (Scientific Information Database, Iran Medex, Magiran and Iran Doc) were searched. Furthermore, the proceedings of Iranian parasitology congresses were explored manually. Our review resulted in a total of 50 publications meeting the inclusion criteria during Jan 1990-June 2015. Totally, 20221 women had been tested during this period of which 7724 women had seropositivity for IgG. According to results of heterogeneity test, either Der Simonian and Laird's random-effects method or Mantel-Haenszel's fixed-effects method were used to pool the estimations. Weighted overall prevalence of toxoplasmosis in pregnant women were obtained using random-effects model, which was estimated 41% (95% CI = 36-45%). Also IgG and IgM antibodies was obtained 38% (95% CI = 34-42%) and 4% (95% CI = 3-5%), respectively.

Mortality, infection, and hepatic function: Oxandrolone therapy did not affect mortality (relative risk (RR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.38, 1.89), P = 0.69) or infection (RR = 0.87, (0.69, 1.11), P = 0.26). The two groups (oxandrolone group vs. control group) showed no significant difference in liver dysfunction (RR = 1.15, (0.83, 1.59), P = 0.41). All the 15 RCTs reported no incidence of hepatic insufficiency in controls or treatment groups. 2. In the catabolic phase: Treatment with oxandrolone shortened length of stay by 3.02 (2.37, 3.66) days, donor-site healing time by 4.41 (3.41, 5.41) days, the time between surgical procedures by 0.63 (0.11, 1.16) days, as well as reduced weight loss by 5 (3.70, 6.30) kg and nitrogen loss by 8.19 (6.87, 9.52) g/day, with all P < 0.00001. 3. In the rehabilitative phase: Treatment with oxandrolone shortened the length of stay to 6.45 (4.20, 8.69) days, as well as decreased weight loss by 0.86 (0.76, 0.96) kg/week and reduction of lean body mass by 5% (3.34, 6.66), with all P < 0.00001. 4. Long-term parameters: Oxandrolone treatment led to an additional gain in lean body mass of 3.99% (3.08, 4.89) after 6 months and 10.78% (9.92, 11.64) after 12 months in patients with severe burns, with all P < 0.00001. Conclusion The treatment of severe burns with oxandrolone is significantly effective without obvious side effects. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved."

Methods: RCTs on the effectiveness of CH and OH in the management of HD were analysed systematically using RevMan?, and combined outcome was expressed as odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference. Results: Eleven CRTs encompassing 1326 patients were analysed systematically. There was significant heterogeneity among included trials. Therefore, in the random effects model, CH was associated with a reduced post-operative pain (SMD, -0.36; 95 % CI, -0.64, -0.07; z = 2.45; p = 0.01), faster wound healing (OR, 0.08; 95 % CI, 0.02, 0.24; z = 4.33; p &lt; 0.0001), lesser risk of post-operative bleeding (OR, 0.50; 95 % CI, 0.27, 0.91; z = 2.27; p &lt; 0.02) and prolonged duration of operation (SMD, 6.10; 95 % CI, 3.21, 8.98; z = 4.13; p &lt; 0.0001). But the variables such as pain on defecation (SMD, -0.33; 95 % CI, -0.68, 0.03; z = 1.82; p = 0.07), length of hospital stay, post-operative complications, HD recurrence and risk of surgical site infection were similar in both groups. Conclusion: CH has clinically measurable advantages over OH in terms of reduced post-operative pain, lower risk of post-operative bleeding and faster wound healing. ? 2016 Soci?t?

Methods A search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases included MeSH terms ¡§bariatric surgery,¡¨ ¡§endoscopy,¡¨ and ¡§preoperative.¡¨ Inclusion criteria were any case series, cohort study, or clinical trial describing results of preoperative EGD for any bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria were studies with&lt;10 patients, patients&lt;18 years of age, or revisional operations. Changes in surgical and medical management and proportions of pathologic findings were extracted and combined in a meta-analysis using the random effects model. Results Initial search identified 532 citations. Forty-eight were included after full text review. Included studies comprised 12,261 patients with a mean (SD) age of 40.5 (1.3) years and body mass index of 46.3 (1.5) kg/m2. The majority of patients (77.1%) were female. The proportion of EGDs resulting in a change in surgical management was 7.8%. After removing benign findings with controversial impact on management (hiatal hernia, gastritis, peptic ulcer), this was found to be .4%. Changes in medical management were seen in 27.5%, but after eliminating Helicobacter pylori eradication, this was found to be 2.5%. Conclusion Preoperative EGD in average-risk, asymptomatic bariatric surgery patients should be considered optional, as the proportion of EGDs that resulted in important changes in management was low. ? 2016 American Society for Bariatric Surgery"

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,Canadian Journal of Plastic Surgery,,,"BACKGROUND: Despite advances in surgical technique, ventral hernia repair (VHR) remains associated with significant postoperative wound complications. OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to identify whether the application of negative pressure wound therapy to closed incisions (iNPWT) following VHR reduces the risk of postoperative wound complications and hernia recurrence. METHODS: The PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies published through October 2015. Publications that met the following criteria were included: adult patients undergoing VHR; comparison of iNPWT with conventional dressings; and documentation of wound complications and/or hernia recurrence. The methodological quality of included studies was independently assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies guidelines. Outcomes assessed included surgical site infection (SSI), wound dehiscence, seroma, and hernia recurrence. Meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled ORs. RESULTS: Five retrospective cohort studies including 477 patients undergoing VHR were included in the final analysis. The use of iNPWT decreased SSI (OR 0.33 [95% CI 0.20 to 0.55]; P<0.0001), wound dehiscence (OR 0.21 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.55]; P=0.001) and ventral hernia recurrence (OR 0.24 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.75]; P=0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of seroma formation (OR 0.59 [95% CI 0.27 to 1.27]; P=0.18). CONCLUSION: For patients undergoing VHR, current evidence suggests a decreased incidence in wound complications using incisional NPWT compared with conventional dressings. ? 2016 Canadian Society of Plastic Surgeons.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effects of ART on blood pressure levels and hypertension risk among HIV-infected populations worldwide. We sought articles that compared the mean blood pressure measurements and hypertension prevalence between HIV-infected adults naive and exposed to ART. Thirty-nine studies comprising 44 903 participants met the inclusion criteria. Overall, systolic (mean difference (MD) 4.52 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.65-6.39, I 2 =68.1%, 19 studies) and diastolic blood pressure levels (MD 3.17 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.71-4.64, I 2 =72.5%, 16 studies) were significantly higher among ART-exposed patients compared with treatment-naive patients. Similarly, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher among ART-exposed patients, such that among 28 908 ART-exposed patients, 4195 (14.5%) had hypertension compared with 950 of 9086 (10.5%) in those who were treatment-naive (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.35-2.10, I 2 =81.5%, 32 studies). In summary, exposure to ART is significantly associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels, and increased risk of hypertension, regardless of study-level sociodemographic differences. This meta-analysis supports the need for population-based strategies to reduce the risk of high blood pressure among people living with HIV on ART. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited."

However, different epidemiologic scenarios could influence national and sub-regional TDR levels and trends. Methods and Findings: We performed a systematic review of currently available publications on TDR in antiretroviral treatment-na?ve adults in LAC. Ninety-eight studies published between January 2000 and June 2015 were included according to critical appraisal criteria and classified by subregion: Brazil (50), Mesoamerica (17), Southern Cone (16), Andean (8) and Caribbean (7). From these, 81 studies encompassing 11,441 individuals with data on DR mutation frequency were included in a meta-analysis. Overall TDR prevalence in LAC was 7.7% (95% CI: 7.2%-8.2%). An increasing trend was observed for overall TDR when comparing 2000-2005 (6.0%) and 2006-2015 (8.2%) (p<0.0001), which was associated with significant NNRTI TDR increase (p<0.0001). NRTI TDR decreased (4.5% vs. 2.3%, p<0.0001). NNRTI TDR increase was associated mainly with K101E, K103N and G190A. NRTI TDR decrease was associated mainly with M184V, K70R and T215Y. All sub-regions reached moderate overall TDR levels. The rapid increase in TDR to all antiretroviral classes in the Caribbean is notable, as well as the significant increase in NNRTI TDR reaching moderate levels in the Southern Cone. NRTI TDR was dominant in 2000-2005, mainly in the Caribbean, Mesoamerica and Brazil. This dominance was lost in 2006-2015 in all sub-regions, with the Southern Cone and the Caribbean switching to NNRTI dominance. PI TDR remained mostly constant with a significant increase only observed in the Caribbean. Conclusions: Given the high conceptual and methodological heterogeneity of HIV TDR studies, implementation of surveys with standardized methodology and national representativeness is warranted to generate reliable to inform public health policies. The observed increasing trend in NNRTI TDR supports the need to strengthen TDR surveillance and programme monitoring and evaluation in LAC. ? 2016 Avila-Rios et al.

Also searched were the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and World Buiatrics Congress conference proceedings from 1996 to 2016, reviews since 2013, reference lists from relevant trials, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration New Animal Drug Application summaries. Eligible studies assessed antibiotic treatment of naturally-occurring IBK in calves randomly allocated to group at the individual level. Outcomes of interest were clinical score, healing time, unhealed ulcer risk, and ulcer surface area. A mixed-effects model comparing active drug with placebo was employed for all outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed visually and using Cochran's Q-test. Thirteen trials assessing nine treatments were included. Compared with placebo, most antibiotic treatments were effective. There was evidence that the treatment effect differed by day of outcome measurement. Visually, the largest differences were observed 7-14 days post-treatment. These results indicate improved IBK healing with many antibiotics and suggest the need for randomized trials comparing different antibiotic treatments. ? Cambridge University Press 2016."

Currently, about 2 billion people are estimated to be infected with Hepatitis B worldwide. Various studies have reported different immune responses to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) in Iranian health staff, while there is not any estimate of overall responses. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the immune response to HBV among health staff in Iran using meta-analysis method. Materials and Methods: This study was a systematic review of Iran databases related to the subject of immune response to HBV, including; Magiran, Iran medex, Iran Doc, SID, Med lib and international databases including Scopus, Pub med, Science Direct, and also Google Scholar search engine. Only those articles that have had inclusion criteria were included. To combine the results of different random effects of studies, the meta-analysis was used. Results: There were 1084 subjects included in 9 studies. The immune response to HBV in health staff was 86.7% (CI: 95%, 80.9-92.6) after 1.21 years of last vaccination. This rate was estimated to be 93.5% for males (CI: 95%, 89.3-97.6) and 90.7% for females (CI: 95%, 84.9-96.5). The minimum and maximum vaccine responsewere reported from Tehran (70.6%) and Yazd (99.2%), respectively. Conclusion: The immunization to HBV in healthcare personnel was more than 80% after 1.21 years of last vaccination. Therefore, performing the complete course of hepatitis B vaccination for prevention of infection would be sufficient and booster dose would not be required. ? 2016, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

The PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Science Direct databases were searched for studies comparing groups with and without antibiotics in intravitreal injection, with the use of the following keywords: ""antibiotic?"", ""endophthalmitis"" and ""intravitreal injection?"". To be included, studies needed to specify number of participants and number of endophthalmitis within each group (with and without antibiotics). We conducted meta-analysis on the prevalence of clinical endophthalmitis including both culture-proven and culture negative samples. Nine studies were included. A total of 88 incidences of endophthalmitis were reported from 174,159 injections (0.051% i.e., one incidence of endophthalmitis for 1979 injections). Specifically, 59 incidences of endophthalmitis were reported from 113,530 injections in the group with antibiotics (0.052% or one incidence of endophthalmitis for 1924 injections) and 29 incidences of endophthalmitis from 60,633 injections in the group without antibiotics (0.048% or one endophthalmitis for 2091 injections). Our meta-analysis did not report a significant difference in the prevalence of clinical endophthalimitis between the two groups with and without topical antibiotics: the odds ratio of clinical endophthalimitis was 0.804 (CI95% 0.384-1.682, p = 0.56) for the antibiotic group compared with the group without antibiotics. In conclusion, we performed the first large meta-analysis demonstrating that antibioprophylaxis is not required in intravitreal injections. Strict rules of asepsis remain the only evidence-based prophylaxis of endophthalmitis.

Manual and electronic search was conducted between 8th of January and 25th of June 2015. A total of twelve published articles and one MSc thesis was retrieved from19 initially identified studies. Twenty five animal level datasets were extracted at regional level considering some hypothesized predictors. The retrieved data were summarized in a meta-analytical approach. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of CCPP was 25.7% (95% CI:20.9,31.0). The inverse variance square (I2) that explains the variation in effect size attributed to reports true heterogeneity was 95.7%.The sub-group analysis was also computed for assumed predictors including, age, sex, type of study population, production systems and regional states. Among these predictors, study population type revealed statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.05). Accordingly, the prevalence estimate for samples collected at abattoir was 39.2%, while that of samples collected at field level was 22.4%. In the final model, type of study population fitted the multivariable meta-regression model accounting for 22.87% of the explainable proportion of heterogeneity among the presumed predictors. Evidence on isolation and confirmation of Mycoplasma capricolum subspp. capripneumonie in the country was obtained from five regional states. In conclusion, it is recommended to further investigate facilities related with transportation and collection premises along with potential role of sheep in the epidemiology of CCPP. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for monitoring the ongoing CCPP control intervention and introduces amendments based on the findings.

Currently, planning for effective care is hindered by lack of knowledge about their health needs and about the impact of on-going programmes on this population's health outcomes.We reviewed healthcare programmes implemented for sub-Saharan African truck drivers, assessed the evaluation methods, and examined impact on health outcomes. Methods We searched scientific and institutional databases, and online search engines to include all publications describing a healthcare programme in sub-Saharan Africa where the main clients were truck drivers. We consulted experts and organisations working with mobile populations to identify unpublished reports. Forest plots of impact and outcome indicators with unadjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were created to map the impact of these programmes. We performed a subgroup analysis by type of indicator using a randomeffects model to assess between-study heterogeneity. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine both the summary effect estimate chosen (risk difference vs. risk ratio) and model to summarise results (fixed vs. random effects). Results Thirty-seven publications describing 22 healthcare programmes across 30 countries were included from 5,599 unique records. All programmes had an HIV-prevention focus with only three expanding their services to cover conditions other primary healthcare services. Twelve programmes were evaluated and most evaluations assessed changes in input, output, and outcome indicators. Absence of comparison groups, preventing attribution of the effect observed to the programme and lack of biologically confirmed outcomes were the main limitations. Four programmes estimated a quantitative change in HIV prevalence or reported STI incidence, with mixed results, and one provided anecdotal evidence of changes in AIDS-related mortality and social norms. Most programmes showed positive changes in risk behaviours, knowledge, and attitudes. Our conclusions were robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Diverse healthcare programmes tailored to the needs of truck drivers implemented in 30 sub-Saharan African countries have shown potential benefits. However, information gaps about availability of services and their effects impede further planning and implementation of effective healthcare programmes for truck drivers. ? 2016 Lalla-Edward et al.

Apart from the genitourinary tract infections, canagliflozin was well tolerated. There was a trend to increase both high and low density lipoprotein cholesterols, but decrease triglycerides in canagliflozin groups compared with control groups. Conclusions: Canagliflozin seems to significantly improve short-term outcomes in participants with T2DM but long-term follow-up data are required. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Results: Five randomized controlled trials and 11 cohort studies were identified. Meta-analysis showed laparoscopic catheter is superior to traditional surgery in terms of controlling catheter migration (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08¡V0.33; p < 0.00001) and catheter survival rate (1-year survival rate: OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.72¡V5.41, p = 0.0001; 2-year survival rate: OR 2. 07, 95% CI 1.29¡V3.33, p = 0.0001), but slightly increases the risk of bleeding (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.07¡V4.23, p = 0.03). The two groups were not significantly different in other catheter-related complications. As regards the quality of the analysis, only the migration analysis ranked A-level, while the rest fell into Class B or C. The overall research quality was moderate.

However, in Ghana, accurate estimates of the prevalence of HIV/HBV coinfection needed to inform policy decisions and the design of public health interventions are currently lacking. In this study, our aim was to determine the HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rate in Ghana. Methods: Primary studies reporting prevalence of HIV/HBV coinfection in Ghana were retrieved through searches conducted in PubMed, science direct, Google scholar and Africa journals online (AJOL) databases. The websites of the Ministry of Health and Ghana Health Service were also searched for related reports or reviews. Additionally, the online repository of two leading Ghanaian universities were searched to identify unpublished thesis related to the subject. All online searches were conducted between 01/03/2016 and 12/03/2016. Further searches were conducted through reference screening of retrieved papers. Results: Twelve (12) studies published between 1999 and 2016 and conducted across seven (7) regions of Ghana were included in this review. The three (3) regions with no studies' representation were Upper East, Upper West and Central regions. The 12 included studies involved a total of 8162 HIV patients. The reported HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rates ranged from 2.4 to 41.7 %. The pooled HIV/HBV coinfection prevalence rate was determined as 13.6 % (95 % CI 10.2-16.8 %; P < 0.001). Conclusions: In Ghana, about one in seven HIV patients may be also be chronically infected with HBV. Preventive interventions and strategic policy directions including systematic screening of all newly diagnosed HIV cases for coinfection will be needed, so as to improve management strategies for HBV infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART) implementation. ? 2016 The Author(s)."

The burden of antibiotic resistance due to ESBL in East Africa is large but information is scarce and thus it is unclear how big the problem really is. To gain insight into the magnitude and molecular epidemiology of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in East Africa a literature search was performed in PubMed on 31 July 2015 to retrieve articles with relevant information on ESBL. Methods and results: Meta-analysis was performed to determine overall proportion estimate of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 4076 bacterial isolates were included in the analysis. The overall pooled proportion of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae among included surveys done in East African hospitals was found to be 0.42 (95 % CI: 0.34-0.50). Heterogeneity (I2) between countries' proportions in ESBL was significantly high (96.95 % and p &lt; 0.001). The frequently detected genes encoding ESBL were CTX-M, TEM, SHV and OXA while the most infrequent reported genes were KPC and NDM. Conclusion: The available studies show a very wide variation in resistance due to ESBL between countries. This highlights a need for active surveillance systems which can help understand the actual epidemiology of ESBL, aid in formulating national or regional guidelines for proper screening of ESBL, and support developing standardized approaches for managing patients colonized with ESBL. ? 2016 Sonda et al."

Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of nine biologics (abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, rituximab, tocilizumab) and small molecule tofacitinib, versus comparator (MTX, DMARD, placebo (PL), or a combination) in adults with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to methotrexate (MTX) or other disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), i.e., MTX/DMARD incomplete responders (MTX/DMARD-IR). Methods: We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via The Cochrane Library Issue 6, June 2015), MEDLINE (via OVID 1946 to June 2015), and EMBASE (via OVID 1947 to June 2015). Data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessments were done in duplicate. We calculated both direct estimates using standard meta-analysis and used Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons approach for NMA estimates to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% credible intervals (CrI). We converted OR to risk ratios (RR) which are reported in the abstract for the ease of interpretation. Main results: This update included 73 new RCTs for a total of 90 RCTs; 79 RCTs with 32,874 participants provided usable data. Few trials were at high risk of bias for blinding of assessors/participants (13% to 21%), selective reporting (4%) or major baseline imbalance (8%); a large number had unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation (68%) or allocation concealment (74%). Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in ACR50 versus comparator (RR 2.71 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.36 to 3.10); absolute benefit 24% more patients (95% CI 19% to 29%), number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) = 5 (4 to 6). NMA estimates for ACR50 in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 3.23 (95% credible interval (Crl) 2.75 to 3.79), non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 2.99; 95% Crl 2.36 to 3.74), and anakinra + MTX/DMARD (RR 2.37 (95% Crl 1.00 to 4.70) were similar to the direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with a clinically and statistically important improvement in function measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (0 to 3 scale, higher = worse function) with a mean difference (MD) based on direct evidence of -0.25 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.22); absolute benefit of -8.3% (95% CI -9.3% to -7.3%), NNTB = 3 (95% CI 2 to 4). NMA estimates for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute benefit, -10.3% (95% Crl -14% to -6.7%) and non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute benefit, -7.3% (95% Crl -13.6% to -0.67%) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with clinically and statistically significantly greater proportion of participants achieving remission in RA (defined by disease activity score DAS < 1.6 or DAS28 < 2.6) versus comparator (RR 2.81 (95% CI, 2.23 to 3.53); absolute benefit 18% more patients (95% CI 12% to 25%), NNTB = 6 (4 to 9)). NMA estimates for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute improvement 17% (95% Crl 11% to 23%)) and non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute improvement 19% (95% Crl 12% to 28%) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for inconsistency), radiographic progression (scale 0 to 448) was statistically significantly reduced in those on biologics + MTX/DMARDs versus comparator, MD -2.61 (95% CI -4.08 to -1.14). The absolute reduction was small, -0.58% (95% CI -0.91% to -0.25%) and we are unsure of the clinical relevance of this reduction. NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute reduction -0.67% (95% Crl -1.4% to -0.12%) and non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (absolute reduction, -0.68% (95% Crl -2.36% to 0.92%)) were similar to respective direct estimates. Based on direct evidence of moderate quality (downgraded for imprecision), results for withdrawals due to adverse events were inconclusive, with wide confidence intervals encompassing the null effect and evidence of an important increase in withdrawals, RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.30). The NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 1.24 (95% Crl 0.99 to 1.57)) and non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (RR 1.20 (95% Crl 0.87 to 1.67)) were similarly inconclusive and downgraded to low for both imprecision and indirectness. Based on direct evidence of high quality, biologic+MTX/DMARD was associated with clinically significantly increased risk (statistically borderline significant) of serious adverse events on biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR [can be interpreted as RR due to low event rate] 1.12 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.27); absolute risk 1% (0% to 2%), As well, the NMA estimate for TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 1.20 (95% Crl 1.01 to 1.43)) showed moderate quality evidence of an increase in the risk of serious adverse events. The other two NMA estimates were downgraded to low quality due to imprecision and indirectness and had wide confidence intervals resulting in uncertainty around the estimates: non-TNF biologics + MTX/DMARD: 1.07 (95% Crl 0.89 to 1.29) and anakinra: RR 1.06 (95% Crl 0.65 to 1.75). Based on direct evidence of low quality (downgraded for serious imprecision), results were inconclusive for cancer (Peto OR 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68) for all biologic+MTX/DMARD combinations. The NMA estimates of TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 1.21 (95% Crl 0.63 to 2.38) and non-TNF biologic+MTX/DMARD (Peto OR 0.99 (95% Crl 0.58 to 1.78)) were similarly inconclusive and downgraded to low quality for both imprecision and indirectness. Main results text shows the results for tofacitinib and differences between medications. Authors' conclusions: Based primarily on RCTs of 6 months' to 12 months' duration, there is moderate quality evidence that the use of biologic+MTX/DMARD in people with rheumatoid arthritis who have failed to respond to MTX or other DMARDs results in clinically important improvement in function and higher ACR50 and remission rates, and increased risk of serious adverse events than the comparator (MTX/DMARD/PL; high quality evidence). Radiographic progression is slowed but its clinical relevance is uncertain. Results were inconclusive for whether biologics + MTX/DMARDs are associated with an increased risk of cancer or withdrawals due to adverse events. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration."

It is usually associated with considerable breathlessness. A number of treatment options are available to manage the uncontrolled accumulation of pleural fluid including administration of a pleurodesis agent (either via a chest tube or at thoracoscopy) or indwelling pleural catheter insertion. Objectives: To ascertain the optimal management strategy for adults with malignant pleural effusion in terms of pleurodesis success. Additionally, to quantify differences in patient-reported outcomes and adverse effects between management strategies. Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE; EBSCO CINAHL; SCI-EXPANDED and SSCI (ISI Web of Science) to April 2015. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of intrapleural interventions for adults with symptomatic MPE in the review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data on study design, study characteristics, outcome measures, potential effect modifiers and risk of bias. The primary outcome measure was pleurodesis failure rate. Secondary outcome measures were adverse effects and complications, patient-reported control of breathlessness, quality of life, cost, mortality, duration of inpatient stay and patient acceptability. We performed network meta-analysis with random effects to analyse the primary outcome data and those secondary outcomes with enough data. We also performed pair-wise random-effects meta-analyses of direct comparison data. If interventions were not deemed jointly randomisable, or insufficient data were available, we reported the results by narrative synthesis. We performed sensitivity analyses to explore heterogeneity and to evaluate only those pleurodesis agents administered via a chest tube at the bedside. Main results: Of the 1888 records identified, 62 randomised trials, including a total of 3428 patients, were eligible for inclusion. All studies were at high or uncertain risk of bias for at least one domain. Network meta-analysis evaluating the rate of pleurodesis failure, suggested talc poudrage to be a highly effective method (ranked second of 16 (95% credible interval (Cr-I) 1 to 5)) and provided evidence that it resulted in fewer pleurodesis failures than eight other methods. The estimated ranks of other commonly used agents were: talc slurry (fourth; 95% Cr-I 2 to 8), mepacrine (fourth; 95% Cr-I 1 to 10), iodine (fifth; 95% Cr-I 1 to 12), bleomycin (eighth; 95% Cr-I 5 to 11) and doxycyline (tenth; 95% Cr-I 4 to 15). The estimates were imprecise as evidenced by the wide credible intervals and both high statistical and clinical heterogeneity. Most of the secondary outcomes, including adverse events, were inconsistently reported by the included studies and the methods used to describe them varied widely. Hence the majority of the secondary outcomes were reported descriptively in this review. We obtained sufficient data to perform network meta-analysis for the most commonly reported adverse events: pain, fever and mortality. The fever network was imprecise and showed substantial heterogeneity, but suggested placebo caused the least fever (ranked first of 11 (95% Cr-I 1 to 7)) and mepacrine and Corynebacterium parvum (C. parvum) appeared to be associated with the most fever (ranked tenth (95% Cr-I 6 to 11) and eleventh (95% Cr-I 7 to 11) respectively). No differences between interventions were revealed by the network meta-analysis of the pain data. The only potential difference in mortality identified in the mortality network was that those receiving tetracycline appeared to have a longer survival than those receiving mitoxantrone (OR 0.16 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.72)). Indwelling pleural catheters were examined in two randomised studies, both of which reported improved breathlessness when compared to talc slurry pleurodesis, despite lower pleurodesis success rates. The risk of bias in a number of the included studies was substantial, for example the vast majority of studies were unblinded, and the methods used for sequence generation and allocation concealment were often unclear. Overall, however, the risk of bias for all studies was moderate. We have not reported the GRADE quality of evidence for the outcomes, as the role of GRADE is not well established in the context of Network Meta-analysis (NMA). Authors' conclusions: Based on the available evidence, talc poudrage is a more effective pleurodesis method in MPE than a number of other frequently used methods, including tetracycline and bleomycin. However further data are required to definitively confirm whether it is more effective than certain other commonly used interventions such as talc slurry and doxycycline, particularly in view of the high statistical and clinical heterogeneity within the network and the high risk of bias of many of the included studies. Based on the strength of the evidence from both direct and indirect comparisons of randomised data of sclerosants administered at the bedside, there is no evidence to suggest large differences between the other highly effective methods (talc slurry, mepacrine, iodine and C. parvum). However, local availability, global experience of these agents and their adverse events, which may not be identified in randomised trials, must also be considered when selecting a sclerosant. Further research is required to delineate the roles of different treatments according to patient characteristics (e.g. according to their prognosis or presence of trapped lung) and to explore patient-centred outcomes, such as breathlessness and quality of life, in more detail. Careful consideration to minimise the risk of bias and standardise outcome measures is essential for future trial design. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with single respiratory virus infection are compared with those with two or more viral-viral coinfection. Studies were restricted to those reporting on children aged less than 5 years (PROSPERO CRD#42014009133). Published data to calculate risk ratios (RR) comparing children with single viral infections to coinfection using a random effects model were used. Similar analyses by pathogen pairs and by excluding children with comorbidities were performed. Of 4443 articles reviewed, 19 were included. Overall, no differences in the risk of fever, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), oxygen use, mechanical ventilation and abnormal radiographs between children with single infection and those with coinfection were found. When analysing only children without comorbidities, the risk of fever (RR = 1.16 to RR = 1.24, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.00-1.55) and ICU admission (RR = 1.08 to RR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.93-1.83) increased but remained non-significant. Point estimates suggested an increased risk of ICU admission in those coinfected with either respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus compared with those with single infection but was non-significant.

Previous case-control studies reported the influence of TLR4 Asp299Gly, TLR4 Thr399Ile, and CD14 C-159T polymorphisms on the risk of severe RSV infection. However, a decisive conclusion has not been achieved. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to examine the association between these three polymorphisms and the development of RSV bronchiolitis. A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, EMbase, Google Scholar Search, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, China Biological Medicine, and Wanfang Databases. The data were extracted and pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated under six genetic models. A total of six studies with 1009 cases and 1348 controls, three studies with 473 cases and 481 controls, or four studies with 325 cases and 650 controls relating to each of the three polymorphisms were included in this meta-analysis.

Although hypotheses suggest HIV-1 disrupts Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) granuloma function, few studies have examined this directly. The objective of this study was to determine what evidence exists about the effect HIV-1 co-infection has upon Mtb granulomas. A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline up to 20 March 2015 was conducted, to identify studies comparing Mtb-infected tissue from HIV-1 infected and uninfected persons, or HIV-1 infected persons with stratified peripheral CD4 T cell (pCD4) counts. We summarized findings that focused on how HIV-1 changes granuloma formation, bacterial presence, cellular composition, and cytokine production. Nineteen studies with a combined sample size of 899 persons were included. Although studies frequently were limited by variable or inadequately described definitions of outcomes and analytical methods, HIV-1 was found to be associated with increased bacillary load within Mtb-infected tissue. Reductions in pCD4 counts within co-infected persons associated with both poorer granuloma formation and higher bacterial load. The high degree of heterogeneity among studies combined with experimental limitations made it difficult to conclusively support previously published and prevalent hypotheses about HIV-1/Mtb co-infection granulomas. To elucidate the validity of these hypotheses we have described areas that can be improved in future studies in order to clarify the influence HIV-1 co-infection has upon the Mtb granuloma. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of dietary flavonoids on upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and immune function in healthy adults. A created search strategy was run against Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and EMBASE classic, CINAHL, and AMED. The returned studies were initially screened, and 2 reviewers independently assessed the remaining studies for eligibility against prespecified criteria. Fourteen studies, of 387 initially identified, were included in this review, and the primary outcome measure was the effect of flavonoids on URTI incidence, duration, and severity. Of the included studies, flavonoid supplementation ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 g/d. Overall, flavonoid supplementation decreased URTI incidence by 33% (95% CI: 31%, 36%) compared with control, with no apparent adverse effects. Sick-day count was decreased by 40% with flavonoid supplementation, although unclear. Differences in bioimmune markers (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, interferon-g, neutrophils) were trivial between the intervention and control groups during the intervention and after exercise when a postintervention exercise bout was included. These findings suggest that flavonoids are a viable supplement to decrease URTI incidence in an otherwise healthy population. ? 2016 American Society for Nutrition."

Aim To investigate the efficacy of Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (L. reuteri) in the management of various types of diarrhoeal diseases in children. Methods Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, trial registries and reference lists of included studies were searched in January 2016, with no language restriction, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Results Eight RCTs (n = 1229) met the inclusion criteria. In treatment trials, L. reuteri administration reduced the duration of diarrhoea (three RCTs, n = 256, mean difference, MD -24.82 h, 95% CI -38.8 to -10.8) and increased the cure rate on day 1 and day 2. However, heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals call for caution in interpreting results. In preventive trials carried out in hospitalised children, based on the findings from two RCTs (n = 290), there was no significant reduction in the risk of nosocomial diarrhoea, rotavirus diarrhoea or diarrhoea of any origin with L. reuteri administration. Based on one RCT (n = 97), there was no effect of L. reuteri on the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. However, the evidence is limited because the overall frequency of diarrhoea was surprisingly low. In preventive studies carried out in apparently healthy children, L. reuteri reduced diarrhoeal outcomes in one RCT; the evidence from another trial was less convincing. Conclusions In therapeutic settings, L. reuteri administration reduces the duration of diarrhoea and increases the chance of cure. In preventive settings, L. reuteri has the potential to reduce the risk of community-acquired diarrhoea in otherwise healthy children. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

However, some trials have demonstrated that this procedure may not be beneficial to the patients. Objective: To determine whether prophylactic placement of a drain in colorectal anastomosis can reduce postoperative complications. Methods: We systematically searched all the electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared routine use of drainage to non-drainage regimes after colorectal anastomosis, using the terms ¡§colorectal¡¨ or ¡§colon/colonic¡¨ or ¡§rectum/rectal¡¨ and ¡§anastomo*¡¨ and ¡§drain or drainage.¡¨ Reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and ongoing trial databases were also screened. Primary outcome measures were clinical and radiological anastomotic leakage. Secondary outcome measures included mortality, wound infection, re-operation, and respiratory complications. We assessed the eligible studies for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Two authors independently extracted data. Results: Eleven RCTs were included (1803 patients in total, 939 patients in the drain group and 864 patients in the no drain group). Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistically significant differences between the drain group and the no drain group in (1) overall anastomotic leakage (relative risk (RR) = 1.14, 95?% confidence interval (CI) 0.80¡V1.62, P = 0.47), (2) clinical anastomotic leakage (RR = 1.39, 95?% CI 0.80¡V2.39, P = 0.24), (3) radiologic anastomotic leakage (RR = 0.92, 95?% CI 0.56¡V1.51, P = 0.74), (4) mortality (RR = 0.94, 95?% CI 0.57¡V1.55, P = 0.81), (5) wound infection (RR = 1.19, 95?% CI 0.84¡V1.69, P = 0.34), (6) re-operation (RR = 1.18, 95?% CI 0.75¡V1.85, P = 0.47), and (7) respiratory complications (RR = 0.82, 95?% CI 0.55¡V1.23, P = 0.34).

Methods Inclusion criteria were double-blind randomized trials using orally administrated OM-89, 6 mg daily, during three months with a minimum of three months of monitoring. Outcomes were the frequency of bacteriuria in 3 and 6 months, dysuria in 6 months and UTI in 6 months. Databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Collaboration and their key references. After analysis by three independent reviewers, 15 double-blind randomized trials were identified, 10 papers excluded due to methods flaws and 5 used for data analysis due to double blinding and reporting drop-outs. Results Among 5 selected studies the date of publication ranged from 1985 to 2005, totalizing 396 patients in the OM-89 group and 392 in the control group. Overall, there were 61 dropouts in the control group and 76 in the OM-89 group. As a major limitation there was no appropriate description of their methodologies and none of the studies described conflict of interest or commitment to the pharmaceutical industry. All studies were multi-centric, except for two, which showed no clarity on allocation concealment. All studies show benefit in favor of vaccine. Conclusions Current literature on prospective randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of oral OM-89 vaccine in the recurrent UTI prophylaxis is of low quality, limited to the first six months only and with variable definition of bacteriuria and UTI. Although all studies show benefit in favor of vaccine, no robust trial was identified, resulting in a high heterogeneity in the data analyzed.

The optimal method of skin closure still remains unclear. Objective This study aimed to compare the outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for skin closure. Methods A meta-analysis was performed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared outcomes of absorbable versus nonabsorbable sutures for skin closure. Results A total of 1748 patients in 19 RCTs were analyzed. There was no significant difference between absorbable sutures and nonabsorbable sutures in the incidence of wound infections, cosmetic outcomes, scar formation, wound dehiscence, and patients' or patient caregivers' satisfaction. Better cosmetic results were achieved by using intradermal absorbable sutures compared with nonabsorbable sutures in subgroup analysis, but this result might be affected by insufficient follow-ups. Conclusions Absorbable sutures for skin closure were not inferior to nonabsorbable sutures. It should be recommended due to its great cost and time savings.

Local infiltration analgesia is an alternate approach that applies the concept of surgical wound infiltration with local anaesthetics. This meta-analysis aims to compare both analgesic treatments for analgesia and functional outcomes after total knee arthroplasty. This meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement guidelines. The primary outcomes were cumulative i.v. morphine consumption, pain scores at rest and on movement on postoperative day one (analogue scale,0-10). Secondary outcomes included range of motion, quadriceps muscle strength, length of stay and rates of complications (neurologic events, cardiovascular events, falls and knee infections). Fourteen trials, including 1122 adult patients were identified. There was no difference in i.v. morphine consumption (mean difference: -2.0 mg; 95% CI: -4.9, 0.9 mg; I2=69%; P=0.19), pain scores at rest (mean difference: -0.1; 95% CI: -0.4, 0.3; I2=72%; P=0.80) and pain scores on movement (mean difference: 0.2; 95% CI: -0.5, 0.8; I2=80%; P=0.64) on postoperative day one (a negative mean difference favours local infiltration analgesia). The qualities of evidence for our primary outcomes were moderate according to the GRADE system. There were no clinical differences in functional outcomes or rates of complications. Complication rates were captured by three trials or fewer with exception of knee infection, which was sought by eight trials. Local infiltration analgesia provides similar postoperative analgesia after total knee arthroplasty to femoral nerve block. Although this meta-analysis did not capture any difference in rates of complications, the low number of trials that specifically sought these outcomes dictates caution. ? 2016 The Author 2016.

However, access to CD4 testing is limited, in part due to the centralized conventional laboratory network. Point of care (POC) CD4 testing has the potential to address some of the challenges of centralized CD4 testing and delays in delivery of timely testing and ART initiation. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the extent to which POC improves linkages to HIV care and timeliness of ART initiation. Methods We searched two databases and four conference sites between January 2005 and April 2015 for studies reporting test turnaround times, proportion of results returned, and retention associated with the use of point-of-care CD4. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled risk ratios, pooled proportions, and 95% confidence intervals. Results We identified 30 eligible studies, most of which were completed in Africa. Test turnaround times were reduced with the use of POC CD4. The time from HIV diagnosis to CD4 test was reduced from 10.5 days with conventional laboratory-based testing to 0.1 days with POC CD4 testing. Retention along several steps of the treatment initiation cascade was significantly higher with POC CD4 testing, notably from HIV testing to CD4 testing, receipt of results, and pre-CD4 test retention (all p<0.001). Furthermore, retention between CD4 testing and ART initiation increased with POC CD4 testing compared to conventional laboratory-based testing (p = 0.01). We also carried out a non-systematic review of the literature observing that POC CD4 increased the projected life expectancy, was cost-effective, and acceptable. Conclusions POC CD4 technologies reduce the time and increase patient retention along the testing and treatment cascade compared to conventional laboratory-based testing. POC CD4 is, therefore, a useful tool to perform CD4 testing and expedite result delivery. ? 2016 Vojnov et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

We conducted a systematic review of the literature to compare the efficacy and safety of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies in patients with cancer. Methods: A literature search using MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE identified all controlled studies comparing the use of restrictive with liberal transfusion in adult oncology participants up to August 10, 2015. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and appraised the quality of the included studies. The primary outcomes of interest were blood utilization and all-cause mortality. Results: Out of 4241 citations, six studies (3 randomized and 3 non-randomized) involving a total of 983 patients were included in the final review.

The efficacy and safety of local infiltration analgesia (LIA) versus regional blockade (RB; epidural analgesia and/or peripheral nerve block) for pain management after TKA are controversial. Objectives: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to determine whether LIA compared with RB would provide better postoperative pain control, consume less morphine, facilitate early functional recovery, entail a differential risk of side effects and complications, and allow a shorter length of stay. Study Design: This meta-analysis pooled all data published in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the efficacy and safety of LIA versus RB following TKA. Setting: The work was performed at Affiliated Cixi Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University. Methods: Literature in English was searched using EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to April 2015. RCTs that compared LIA and RB for postoperative analgesia following TKA were included. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Back Review Group checklist, and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Sixteen RCTs with a total of 1,206 patients were finally included in our study. Results: The results of our meta-analysis indicate that patients managed by LIA showed significantly lower numeric rating scale (NRS) score at rest (WMD: -0.40 [-0.72, -0.07]; P = 0.02) when compared with those managed by RB. Difference of morphine consumption was not significant (WMD: -1.39 [-7.21, 4.44]; P = 0.64) between the 2 groups. In terms of early functional recovery, the LIA group showed more straight leg raise (RR: 2.90 [2.15, 3.93]; P < 0.00001) on the first postoperative day; better range of motion within one week (WMD: 4.33 [2.61, 6.05]; P < 0.00001), but not at 3 months (WMD: 1.98 [-0.02, 3.98]; P = 0.05); and comparable knee society score (WMD: -8.79 [-27.05, 9.48]; P = 0.35). Length of hospital stay of the LIA group was marginally shorter (WMD: -0.25 [-0.49, -0.01]; P = 0.05) than that of the RB group. Risk of side effects and complications were comparable between groups. Limitations: The lack of a standard criterion regarding the technique details of LIA and heterogeneity resulting from the various analgesic components, dosages, and different administration methods might have posed a bias on the results. Conclusion: Our results have indicated that LIA provided better analgesia than RB at rest and preserved quadriceps function in the immediate postoperative period, which may be beneficial to early functional recovery. And its safety profile is reliable. With the biases in our meta-analysis, a rigorous and adequately powered RCT is needed to validate our results. ? 2016, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved."

They are used clinically worldwide. Objectives: To (1) describe the potential benefits and harms of NIs for influenza in all age groups by reviewing all clinical study reports (CSRs) of published and unpublished randomised, placebo-controlled trials and regulatory comments; and (2) determine the effect of oseltamivir (Tamiflu?, Roche) treatment on mortality in patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. Methods: We searched trial registries, electronic databases and corresponded with regulators and sponsors to identify randomised trials of NIs. We requested full CSRs and accessed regulators¡¦ comments. We included only those trials for which we had CSRs. To examine the effects of oseltamivir on 2009A/H1N1 influenza mortality, we requested individual patient data (IPD) from corresponding authors of all included observational studies. Results: Effect of oseltamivir and zanamivir (Relenza?, GlaxoSmithKline) in the prevention and treatment of influenza: Oseltamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 16.8 hours [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.4 to 25.1 hours]. Zanamivir reduced the time to first alleviation of symptoms in adults by 0.60 days (95% CI 0.39 to 0.81 days). Oseltamivir reduced unverified pneumonia in adult treatment [risk difference (RD) 1.00%, 95% CI 0.22% to 1.49%]; similar findings were observed with zanamivir prophylaxis in adults (RD 0.32%, 95% CI 0.09% to 0.41%). Oseltamivir treatment of adults increased the risk of nausea (RD 3.66%, 95% CI 0.90% to 7.39%) and vomiting (RD 4.56%, 95% CI 2.39% to 7.58%). In the treatment of children, oseltamivir induced vomiting (RD 5.34%, 95% CI 1.75% to 10.29%). Both oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis reduced the risk of symptomatic influenza in individuals (oseltamivir RD 3.05%, 95% CI 1.83% to 3.88%; zanamivir RD 1.98%, 95% CI 0.98% to 2.54%) and in households (oseltamivir RD 13.6%, 95% CI 9.52% to 15.47%; zanamivir RD 14.84%, 95% CI 12.18% to 16.55%). Oseltamivir increased psychiatric adverse events in the combined on- and off-treatment periods (RD 1.06%, 95% CI 0.07% to 2.76%) and the risk of headaches while on treatment (RD 3.15%, 95% CI 0.88% to 5.78%). Effect of oseltamivir on mortality in patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza: Analysis of summary data of 30 studies as well as IPD of four studies showed evidence of time-dependent bias. After adjusting for time-dependent bias and potential confounding variables, competing risks analysis of the IPD showed insufficient evidence that oseltamivir reduced the risk of mortality (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.65). Conclusions: Oseltamivir and zanamivir cause small reductions in the time to first alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults. The use of oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea, vomiting, psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children. Oseltamivir has no protective effect on mortality among patients with 2009A/H1N1 influenza. Prophylaxis with either NI may reduce symptomatic influenza in individuals and in households. The balance between benefits and harms should be considered when making decisions about use of NIs for either prophylaxis or treatment of influenza. ? Queen¡¦s Printer and Controller of HMSO 2016."

The pooled prevalence in the male population was 11.1% (95% CI, 7.4%¡V16.4%) and in female was 12.8% (95% CI, 9.8%¡V16.5%). The prevalence of these bacteria was significantly higher in infertile men compared with that in fertile men. A high level of heterogeneity was observed for both men (I2 = 92.4%; P&lt;0.001) and women (I2 = 93.3%; P&lt;0.001). Some evidence for publication bias was observed in both men [Egger¡¦s test (two-tailed P=0.0007), and Begg¡¦s test (two-tailed P=0.0151)] and women [Egger¡¦s test (two-tailed P=0.0006), and Begg¡¦s test (two-tailed P=0.0086)] analysis. Conclusion: Since urogenital mycoplasmas may play a role in male infertility, screening strategies, particularly for asymptomatic individuals, and treatment of infected ones, which can reduce consequent complications, looks to be necessary. ? 2016, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

Accurate and updated data on HBV prevalence is important for further planning to control the infection. The aim of this study was to update the prevalence estimate of HBV infection in the general population of Iran. Evidence Acquisition: A systematic review was done for data on the prevalence of HBV infection in the general Iranian population published between Jan. 1, 1990, and Jan. 1, 2016, in both international and national databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Scientific Information Database, IranMedex, and Magiran. All papers with clearly described time and location of the study, proper sampling strategies, and proper analysis methods were included in the present study. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Prevalence of HBV infection with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using Stata software, version 13. Results: The polled estimated prevalence of HBVinfection in the general population of Iranwas2.2% (95% CI: 1.9% - 2.6%). The highest prevalence of HBV infection (8.9%, 95% CI: 7.6% - 10.2%) was reported from Golestan province, and the lowest prevalence (0.7%, 95% CI: 0.4% - 1.1%) was seen in Kermanshah province. The prevalence of HBV infection was estimated at 3% (95% CI: 2.2% - 3.8%) for Iranian males and 1.7% (95% CI: 1.2% - 2.3%) for Iranian females. The prevalence of HBV infection in the general population of Iran was 2.9% (95% CI: 2.5% - 3.4%) before 2010 and 1.3% (95% CI: 0.9% - 1.7%) after 2010. Conclusions: In total, Iran was classified within the low¡VintermediateHBVprevalence areas (2% - 4%), while according to recent data (after 2010), Iran was classified within the low HBV prevalence areas (< 2%), indicating that preventive measures conducted in Iran have been effective. ? 2016, Kowsar Corp."

The Eastern Mediterranean regional office (EMRO) of the world health organization (WHO) seems to have one of the highest prevalence rates worldwide, with at least 21.3 million HCV-infected patients. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to review systematically all epidemiological data related to the prevalence of HCV genotypes in infected patients in EMRO countries. Data Sources: A systematic search was conducted of peer-reviewed journals indexed in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, ISI, PakMediNet, and IMEMR, and Persian-specific databases including SID, Iran Medex, and MagIran). Study Selection: A systematic search was performed with temporal limits (papers published between January 2000 up to June 2015), regarding the prevalence and distribution of HCV genotypes in EMRO countries. Data Extraction: The prevalence rates of HCV genotypes were pooled by metan command in Stata 14. Statistical heterogeneity was explored using the I-square at the 5% significance level. Publication bias was assessed, graphically and statistically, by funnel plot and Begg and Egger tests. Results: A total of 563 records were identified through the electronic search. Of these records, 134 studies comprising 67681 HCVinfected individuals were included in the meta-analysis. In Iran, subtype 1a was the predominant subtype with a rate of 42% (95% CI, 39 - 46), followed by subtype 3a, 35% (95% CI, 31 - 38). In Pakistan, Subtype 3a was the most common subtype with a rate of 56% (95% CI, 49 - 62), followed by subtype 3b, 10% (95% CI, 7 - 12). In Saudi Arabia and Egypt, genotype 4 was the most prevalent genotype with a rate of 65% (95% CI, 59 - 72) and 69% (95% CI, 36 - 100) respectively. In Tunisia and Morocco, subtype 1b was the most common subtype with a rate of 69% (95% CI, 50 - 88) and 32% (95% CI, 7 - 56) respectively. Conclusions: The genotype distribution of HCV takes diverse patterns in EMRO countries. Genotypes 1 and 3 were predominant in Iran and Pakistan, while genotype 4 and 1 were the most common genotypes in the Middle East Arab countries and North African Arab countries.

Systematic review and a meta-analysis,2016,Reproductive Health,10.1186/s12978-016-0149-5,27048501,"Background: Antiretroviral therapy is recommended during pregnancy to decrease the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 infection and to improve maternal health. However, some studies have reported that antiretroviral treatment (ART) containing protease inhibitors (PI) is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. In contrast, other studies have reported no increased risk. This meta-analysis was conducted to derive a more reliable estimate of the association between the prenatal use of PI based ART regimen and preterm birth. Methods: A systemic review and meta-analysis was conducted using published studies which were identified through a computerized search using the Medline/PubMed database, Google Scholar and Health Inter Network Access to Research Initiative (HINARI). The analysis was undertaken using STATA version 11.0 software and studies were described by forest plot. Heterogeneity across studies was checked using Cochran Q test and I2 test. An adjusted odd ratio with 95 % confidence intervals [95 % CI] was pooled using a random effects model. Results: The Cochrane Q test (Q test p = 0.051) showed a good homogeneity among studies. However, medium heterogeneity was observed in up to 46 % of the sample using the I2 test (I2 = 46.5 %). The Egger weighted regression method (p = 0.04) showed evidence of publication bias, but Begg rank correlation statistics (p = 0.47) did not show evidence of publication bias. The pooled analysis of 10 studies showed that protease based ART exposure during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (pooled odds ratio 1.32 (95 % CI, 1.04 to 1.59). Conclusions: This meta-analysis revealed that the PI based ART exposure during pregnancy is significantly associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. There should be strong cautions against initiating ART during pregnancy and PI based ARV should be replaced by others drug regime. Protease inhibitor ART drugs should not be included as part of therapy during pregnancy. ? 2016 Mesfin et al."

Methods: This meta-analysis evaluated English-language studies from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The Cochrane Collaboration methodology was used to evaluate all publications regarding daily CHG bathing and the risks of acquiring central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Risk ratios (RRs) and the ratio of the log RRs (RRR) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Eighteen studies were included. Compared with conventional care, the RRs (95% CIs) for CLABSI, MRSA, and VRE with CHG bathing were 0.45 (0.37-0.55), 0.67 (0.59-0.77), and 0.60 (0.42-0.85), respectively (all, P <.05). For MRSA acquisition, CHG bathing with concomitant nasal antibiotics provided a lower incidence compared with only CHG bathing (RRR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, P =035). Greater risk reduction was also observed in studies with prolonged interventions (RRR per 1-month extension: - 0.02, P =027). Conclusions: Daily CHG bathing was associated with reduced risks of acquiring CLABSI, MRSA, and VRE. A prolonged intervention period and concomitant nasal antibiotic use were associated with lower risks of MRSA acquisition. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Antibiotics are used widely as postinjury prophylaxis, but their efficacy is unclear. This meta-analysis assessed the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis versus placebo or no treatment on wound infection rates in hand injuries managed surgically. Methods Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Central, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Portal were searched for published and unpublished studies in any language from inception to September 2015. The primary outcome was the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on wound infection rates. Open fractures, crush injuries and bite wounds were excluded. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis, and risk ratios (RRs) and 95 per cent c.i. obtained. Results Thirteen studies (2578 patients) were included, comprising five double-blind randomized clinical trials, five prospective trials and three cohort studies.

Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is well recognized for the management of open wounds and has been applied recently to closed surgical incisions. The evidence base to support this intervention is limited. The aim of this study was to assess whether NPWT reduces postoperative wound complications when applied to closed surgical incisions. Methods This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of NPWT compared with standard postoperative dressings on closed surgical incisions. Results Ten studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 1311 incisions in 1089 patients. NPWT was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection (relative risk (RR) 0¡P54, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P33 to 0¡P89) and seroma formation (RR 0¡P48, 0¡P27 to 0¡P84) compared with standard care. The reduction in wound dehiscence was not significant. The numbers needed to treat were three (seroma), 17 (dehiscence) and 25 (infection). Methodological heterogeneity across studies led to downgrading of the quality of evidence to moderate for infection and seroma, and low for dehiscence. Conclusion Compared with standard postoperative dressings, NPWT significantly reduced the rate of wound infection and seroma when applied to closed surgical wounds.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,Surgical Infections,10.1089/sur.2015.145,26784527,"Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and death after surgical intervention. The use of physical barriers, including gloves, drapes, and gowns to reduce SSI after abdominal surgery is long-standing practice. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of ring incision retractors in reducing the risk of SSI in abdominal surgery. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Central Register, and the ISRCTN registry were searched for RCTs in which ring retractors were utilized to reduce SSI in abdominal surgery. The PRISMA guidelines and RevMan 5.3 were used for study selection and analysis. Additional subgroup analyses were performed, including trials using incision class (clean, clean-contaminated contaminated, and dirty) and trials that used the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's SSI definition in their protocol. Results: A total of 19 RCTs inclusive of 4,229 patients were included. The utility of ring retractors in reducing SSI was suggested by an overall risk ratio of 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.81). However, study heterogeneity caused by differences in effect size between individual RCTs, the non-standardized utilization of concomitant measures to reduce SSI, and an overall lack of high-quality trials was found. Conclusion: A reduction in SSI incidence with the use of ring retractors is suggested by the findings. However, this result must be treated with caution because in addition to some old trials poor quality and the large number of factors affecting SSI, there were substantial differences between trials in effect sizes in statistical heterogeneity. Further RCTs are needed to confirm this provisional finding. ? Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016."

Objective To perform a systematic review and formal meta-analysis of the literature reporting on HPV detection in LSCC. Methods Literature was searched from January 1964 until March 2015. The effect size was calculated as event rates (95% confidence interval [CI]), with homogeneity testing using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Meta-regression was used to test the impact of study-level covariates (HPV detection method, geographic origin) on effect size. Potential publication bias was estimated using funnel plot symmetry. Results One hundred seventy nine studies were eligible, comprising a sample size of 7,347 LSCCs from different geographic regions. Altogether, 1,830 (25%) cases tested HPV-positive considering all methods, with effect size of 0.269 (95% CI: 0.242 to 0.297; random-effects model). In meta-analysis stratified by the 1) HPV detection technique and 2) geographic study origin, the between-study heterogeneity was significant only for geographic origin (P =.0001). In meta-regression, the HPV detection method (P =.876) or geographic origin (P =.234) were not significant study-level covariates. Some evidence for publication bias was found only for studies from North America and those using non-polymerase chain reaction methods, with a marginal effect on adjusted point estimates for both. Conclusions Variability in HPV detection rates in LSCC is explained by geographic origin of study but not by HPV detection method. However, they were not significant study-level covariates in formal meta-regression. ? 2015 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc."

Results: A total of 10 trials involving 734 patients were identified for this review. The quality of included trials was limited, and very few trials reported all-cause mortality or cardiovascular calcification without any differences between two groups. Compared with active non-selective VDRAs, paricalcitol showed no significant difference in both PTH reduction (MD ?7.78, 95?% CI ?28.59¡V13.03, P?=?0.46) and the proportion of patients who achieved the target reduction of PTH (OR 1.27, 95?% CI 0.87¡V1.85, P?=?0.22).

Numerous communication tools to assist patients, family members, and clinicians in end-of-life decision-making have been published, but their effectiveness remains unclear. Objectives: To determine, amongst adults in ambulatory care settings, the effect of structured communication tools for end-of-life decision-making on completion of advance care planning. Methods: We searched for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomized intervention studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, and the Cochrane Database of Randomized Controlled Trials from database inception until July 2014. Two reviewers independently screened articles for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence for each of the primary and secondary outcomes. Results: Sixty-seven studies, including 46 RCTs, were found. The majority evaluated communication tools in older patients (age >50) with no specific medical condition, but many specifically evaluated populations with cancer, lung, heart, neurologic, or renal disease. Most studies compared the use of communication tools against usual care, but several compared the tools to less-intensive advance care planning tools. The use of structured communication tools increased: the frequency of advance care planning discussions/discussions about advance directives (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.25-4.26, p = 0.007, low quality evidence) and the completion of advance directives (ADs) (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.43-2.59, p<0.001, low quality evidence); concordance between AD preferences and subsequent medical orders for use or non-use of life supporting treatment (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.39, p = 0.028, very low quality evidence, 1 observational study); and concordance between the care desired and care received by patients (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30, p = 0.004, low quality evidence, 2 RCTs). Conclusions: The use of structured communication tools may increase the frequency of discussions about and completion of advance directives, and concordance between the care desired and the care received by patients. The use of structured communication tools rather than an ad-hoc approach to end-of-life decision-making should be considered, and the selection and implementation of such tools should be tailored to address local needs and context.

Results: Eight studies involving 1034 patients with esophageal cancer were included for meta-analysis. The pooled analysis showed that HPV infection caused a significantly worse OS in esophageal cancer patients (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.65). Subgroup analyses showed a significant correlation between HPV infection and OS in multiple types of HPV infection subgroup (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.00-1.73) and in multiple therapies subgroup (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03-1.73). Conclusion: HPV infection predicted a significantly worse prognosis in patients with esophageal cancer, and HPV might act as a promising prognostic factor for esophageal cancer. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

CNKI, Embase, Medline, and Cochrane central database were searched using a broad range of terms to identify original research, published all through August 2015 and identified potentially studies. Qualified studies had to meet the quality assessment criteria by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and evaluate the multiple risk factors for heterotopic ossification after elbow trauma. Six studies involving 1636 elbow injury patients and 214 HOs (13.1%) were eligible and included in this meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis identified the significant risk factors for HO about elbow were male gender (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.09-3.81), combined radius/ulna fractures (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.52-7.88), overall fracture dislocation (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.37-7.16), ulnohumeral fracture dislocations (OR, 4.17; 95% CI, 2.44-7.13), terrible triad (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.93-5.87), floating elbow (OR, 10.23; 95% CI, 3.20-32.68) and delay from injury to surgery (odds per day) (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04- 1.13). The proximal ulna fracture of elbow was likely to be negatively correlated with development of HO about the elbow (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.78). The other variables including other fracture types, other fracture dislocations, open fracture, infection, head injury and ipsilateral injury were identified not as the risk factors for development of HO. Related prophylaxis strategies should be implemented in patients involved with above-mentioned medical conditions to prevent HO after elbow trauma. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Scarce data are available, regarding the magnitude and poor treatment outcomes of VL-HIV coinfection. Objective: The main objective of this systematic review was to describe the pooled prevalence of VL and poor treatment outcome among HIV patients. Review methods: Electronic databases mainly PubMed were searched. Databases, such as Google and Google scholar, were searched for gray literature. Articles were selected based on their inclusion criterion, whether they included HIV-positive individuals with VL diagnosis. STATA 11 software was used to conduct a meta-analysis of pooled prevalence of VL-HIV coinfection. Results: Fifteen of the 150 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A majority of the study participants were males between 25 years and 41 years of age. The pooled prevalence of VL-HIV coinfection is 5.2% with 95% confidence interval of (2.45-10.99). Two studies demonstrated the impact of antiretroviral treatment on reduction in relapse rate compared with patients who did not start antiretroviral treatment. One study showed that the higher the baseline CD4+ cell count (>100 cells/mL) the lower the relapse rate. Former VL episodes were identified as risk factors for relapse in two articles. In one of the articles, an earlier bout of VL remains significant in the model adjusted to other variables. Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of VL in HIV-infected patients is low and an earlier bout of VL and CD4+ count <100 cells/mL at the time of primary VL diagnosis are factors that predict poor treatment outcome. ? 2016 Alemayehu et al."

As the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recently demonstrated PPV-23 is likely beneficial to immunocompromised adults by the Grading, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, we conducted meta-analysis to examine its efficacy in an immunocompetent population. Methods: We searched the PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized trials. Overall relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidential intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the Cochrane Q test (p, I2) was performed. Outcomes were assessed by the GRADE framework. Results: Seven randomized trials involving 156,010 participants were included in this meta-analysis. High-quality evidence revealed that PPV-23 was weakly associated with the prevention of all-cause pneumonia ([RR] 0.87, [95%CI] 0.76-0.98, p = 0.11, I2 = 43%), especially among the target population ([RR] 0.72, [95%CI] 0.69-0.94, p = 0.58 I2 = 0%), the elderly group aged over 40 years ([RR] 0.80, [95%CI] 0.69-0.94) and the Japanese population ([RR] 0.72, [95%CI] 0.59-0.88, p = 0.24, I2 = 30%). The target population included adults aged over 65 years and patients at high risk of pneumonia due to chronic lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or living in a nursing home. Protective trends of PPV-23 in the outcomes of pneumococcal pneumonia ([RR] 0.54, [95%CI] 0.18-1.65, p = 0.01, I2 = 77%) and mortality due to pneumonia ([RR] 0.67, [95%CI] 0.43-1.04, p = 0.67, I2 = 0%) were observed, although the results were statistically insignificant, possibly due to the small number of trials included. PPV-23 did not prevent all-cause mortality ([RR] 1.04, [95%CI] 0.87-1.24, p = 0.95, I2 = 0%). Conclusions: PPV-23 provided weak protection against all-cause pneumonia in an immunocompetent population, especially among the target population. The additional benefit of PPV-23 in preventing CAP further supports its application in the target population. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd."

Design and data analysis Systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled percentage prevalence of resistance to the most commonly used antibiotics in children in primary care, stratified by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) status of the study country. Random effects meta-analysis was used to quantify the association between previous exposure to antibiotics in primary care and resistance. Data sources Observational and experimental studies identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, searched for articles published up to October 2015. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Studies were eligible if they investigated and reported resistance in community acquired urinary tract infection in children and young people aged 0-17. Electronic searches with MeSH terms and text words identified 3115 papers. Two independent reviewers assessed study quality and performed data extraction. Results 58 observational studies investigated 77 783 E coli isolates in urine. In studies from OECD countries, the pooled prevalence of resistance was 53.4% (95% confidence interval 46.0% to 60.8%) for ampicillin, 23.6% (13.9% to 32.3%) for trimethoprim, 8.2% (7.9% to 9.6%) for co-amoxiclav, and 2.1% (0.8 to 4.4%) for ciprofloxacin; nitrofurantoin was the lowest at 1.3% (0.8% to 1.7%). Resistance in studies in countries outside the OECD was significantly higher: 79.8% (73.0% to 87.7%) for ampicillin, 60.3% (40.9% to 79.0%) for co-amoxiclav, 26.8% (11.1% to 43.0%) for ciprofloxacin, and 17.0% (9.8% to 24.2%) for nitrofurantoin. There was evidence that bacterial isolates from the urinary tract from individual children who had received previous prescriptions for antibiotics in primary care were more likely to be resistant to antibiotics, and this increased risk could persist for up to six months (odds ratio 13.23, 95% confidence interval 7.84 to 22.31). Conclusions Prevalence of resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics in primary care in children with urinary tract infections caused by E coli is high, particularly in countries outside the OECD, where one possible explanation is the availability of antibiotics over the counter. This could render some antibiotics ineffective as first line treatments for urinary tract infection. Routine use of antibiotics in primary care contributes to antimicrobial resistance in children, which can persist for up to six months after treatment. ? BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2016."

METHODS: A search was performed for relevant publications in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases. The pooled effects were calculated from the available information to identify the relationship between HBV or HCV infection and the prognosis and clinicopathological features. The £Y 2 and I 2 tests were used to evaluate heterogeneity between studies. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a fixed-effects model, if no heterogeneity existed. If there was heterogeneity, a random-effects model was applied. RESULTS: In total, 14 studies involving 2842 cases were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The patients with HBV infection presented better overall and diseasefree survival, and the pooled HRs were significant at 0.76 (95%CI: 0.70-0.83) and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.66-0.94), respectively. Additionally, our study revealed that HCV infection was correlated with shortened overall survival in comparison with the control group (HR = 2.64, 95%CI: 1.77-3.93). We also found that HBV infection occurred more frequently in male patients [odds ratio (OR) = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.06-3.44] and was correlated with higher levels of serum aspartate transaminase (AST) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (OR = 1.93, 95%CI: 1.11-3.35; OR = 3.86, 95%CI: 2.58-5.78) and a lower level of serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (OR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.34-0.65). Moreover, HBV infection was associated with cirrhosis (OR = 6.44, 95%CI: 4.33-9.56), a higher proportion of capsule formation (OR = 6.04, 95%CI: 3.56-10.26), and a lower rate of lymph node metastasis (OR = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.25-0.58). No significant publication bias was seen in any of the enrolled studies. CONCLUSION: HBV infection may indicate a favorable prognosis in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, while HCV infection suggests a poor prognosis. ? 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

The primary outcome was culture-proven bacterial and/or fungal sepsis. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects model was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Twenty-seven trials were included in our review, and 25 trials involving 6104 preterm neonates were statistically analyzed. Pooled analysis indicated that enteral probiotic supplementation significantly reduced the risk of any sepsis (25 RCTs; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94; I2=26%), bacterial sepsis (11 RCTs; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95; I2=0%), and fungal sepsis (6 RCTs; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41-0.78; I2=0%). This beneficial effect remains in very low birth weight infants (<1500 g) (19 RCTs; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.97; I2=18%), but not in extremely low birth weight infants (<1000 g) (3 RCTs; RR 0.73, 95%CI 0.45-1.19; I2=53%). All the included trials reported no systemic infection caused by the supplemental probiotic organisms. Current evidence indicates that probiotic supplementation is safe, and effective in reducing the risk of LOS in preterm neonates in neonatal intensive care units. Further studies are needed to address the optimal probiotic organism, dosing, timing, and duration. High-quality and adequately powered RCTs regarDing the efficacy and safety of the use of probiotics in extremely low birth weight infants are still warranted.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses checklist was used as the methodological guide. Two reviewers independently assessed the study quality using a validated modified quality assessment tool. Six articles met inclusion criteria; the majority were cross-sectional studies (83.3?%) designed to estimate HCV infection prevalence rates and identify associated risk factors. HCV prevalence ranged from 1.4 to 11.8?%. A pooled HCV infection prevalence of 3.3?% (95?% confidence interval: 1.5¡V7.2?%) was estimated based on 1920 LTC residents with substantial heterogeneity noted (Q = 51.1, p &lt; 0.001; I2 = 90.2). Three of six studies reported statistically significant factors associated with an increased risk for HCV infection, including older age, female gender, history of blood transfusions, short duration of LTC residence, and hepatitis B virus positivity. This study reports a higher prevalence of HCV infection among older adults in LTC settings compared to community-dwelling older adults; however, accurate estimation of prevalence is limited by heterogeneity between and within studies, variation in sampling and recruitment methodologies, and absence of the HCV-RNA test to confirm active infection. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Humans usually acquire infection by digestion of infected Pomacea canaliculata and Achatina fulica, the most predominant intermediate hosts found in China. This meta-analysis was aimed to assess the prevalence of A. cantonensis infection among these two snails in China in the past 10?years. Data were systematically collected in electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CNKI, SinoMed, VIP, CSCD, and Wanfang from 2005 to 2015. Thirty-eight studies with a total of 41,299 P. canaliculata and 21,138 Ac. fulica were included in the present study. The overall infection rate of A. cantonensis in China was estimated to be 7.6?% (95?% confidential interval (CI) = 0.063 to 0.090) in P. canaliculata and 21.5?% in Ac. fulica (95?% CI = 0.184 to 0.245), respectively.

Twostage revision is the most widely used technique and considered as the most effective for treating periprosthetic knee infection. The one-stage revision strategy is an emerging alternative option, however, its performance in comparison to the two-stage strategy is unclear. We therefore sought to ask if there was a difference in re-infection rates and other clinical outcomes when comparing the one-stage to the two-stage revision strategy. Objective: Our first objective was to compare re-infection (new and recurrent infections) rates for oneand two-stage revision surgery for periprosthetic knee infection. Our second objective was to compare between the two revision strategies, clinical outcomes as measured by postoperative Knee Society Knee score, Knee Society Function score, Hospital for Special Surgery knee score, WOMAC score, and range of motion. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, reference lists of relevant studies to August 2015, and correspondence with investigators. Study selection: Longitudinal (prospective or retrospective cohort) studies conducted in generally unselected patients with periprosthetic knee infection treated exclusively by one- or two-stage revision and with re-infection outcomes reported within two years of revision surgery. No clinical trials comparing both revision strategies were identified. Review methods: Two independent investigators extracted data and discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third investigator. Re-infection rates from 10 one-stage studies (423 participants) and 108 two-stage studies (5,129 participants) were meta-analysed using random-effect models after arcsine transformation. Results: The rate (95% confidence intervals) of re-infection was 7.6% (3.4-13.1) in one-stage studies. The corresponding re-infection rate for two-stage revision was 8.8% (7.2-10.6). In subgroup analyses, re-infection rates remained generally similar for several study-level and clinically relevant characteristics. Postoperative clinical outcomes of knee scores and range of motion were similar for both revision strategies. Limitations: Potential bias owing to the limited number of one-stage revision studies and inability to explore heterogeneity in greater detail. Conclusions: Available evidence from aggregate published data suggest the one-stage revision strategy may be as effective as the two-stage revision strategy in treating infected knee prostheses in generally unselected patients. Further investigation is warranted. ? 2016 Kunutsor et al.

Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated comparing treatment regimens for eradication of H. pylori infection with and without doxycycline. Results: The OR for eradication success rate in a fixed model was in favor for treatment regimens with doxycycline: 1.292, 95% CI 1.048-1.594, p = 0.016. There was no significant heterogeneity in the included studies: Q = 15.130, d.f. (Q) = 8, I2 = 47.126, p &gt; 0.10. When treatment regimens with doxycycline were compared only with treatment regimens with tetracycline, no significant difference was found in eradication success rate: OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.68-1.32, p = 0.77. But when treatment regimens with doxycycline were compared with treatment regimens without tetracycline, the OR in favor of doxycycline was even higher: OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21-2.09, p &lt; 0.001. Conclusion: In this meta-analysis, we confirmed doxycycline efficiency in the eradication of H. pylori. Thus, triple, quadruple or even high dose dual therapy with regimens containing doxycycline should be considered. ? 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel."

A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing noninvasive weaning at spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) failure after meeting simple weaning criteria or at the pulmonary infection control window (PIC window) with conventional invasive weaning in COPD patients. Using conventional invasive weaning as a bridge, we indirectly compared the two noninvasive weaning strategies using the Bucher approach. Noninvasive weaning at SBT failure after meeting simple weaning criteria was associated with an extended duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation (standardized mean difference 1.90, 95% CI 1.27-2.53, P < 0.001) compared with noninvasive weaning at the PIC window. No significant differences in mortality or the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia were observed. Our study suggests that the PIC window may be a promising switching time for noninvasive weaning in COPD patients. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc."

Together with HTLV-2, it is endemic in some African nations. Seroprevalence data from Malawi are scarce, with no reports on associated disease incidence. HTLV seroprevalence and type were tested in 418 healthy mothers from Malawi. In addition, we tested the sera of 534 children to investigate mother-to-child transmission. To provide context, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of HTLV seroprevalence in African women and children. Methods: Stored samples from a previous childhood cancer and BBV study were analysed. ELISA was used for HTLV screening followed by immunoblot for confirmation and typing. Standard methods were used for the systematic review. Results: HTLV seroprevalence was 2.6% (11/418) in mothers and 2.2% (12/534) in children. Three mothers carried HTLV-1 alone, seven had HTLV-2 and one was dually infected. Three children carried HTLV-1 alone, seven had HTLV-2 and two were dually infected. Only two corresponding mothers of the 12 HTLV-positive children were HTLV positive. The systematic review included 66 studies of women and 13 of children conducted in 25 African countries. Seroprevalence of HTLV-1 varied from 0 to 17% and of HTLV-2 from 0 to 4%. Conclusions: In contrast to findings from other studies in Africa, the seroprevalence of HTLV-2 was higher than that of HTLV-1 in Malawi and one of the highest for the African region. The lack of mother-child concordance suggests alternative sources of infection among children. Our data and analyses contribute to HTLV prevalence mapping in Africa. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

However, the evidence in support of preemptive intervention is controversial. We evaluated benefits and harms of preemptive versus deferred correction of AV access stenosis. Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Setting &amp; Population Adults receiving hemodialysis by a functional AV access. Selection Criteria for Studies We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register and EMBASE to October 15, 2015. Intervention Active access surveillance (flow measurement and Doppler or venous pressure) and preemptive correction of a newly identified stenosis versus routine clinical monitoring and deferred salvage, or preemptive correction of a known stenosis versus deferred salvage. Outcomes Access loss (primary outcome) and thrombosis (overall and by access type), infection, mortality, hospitalization, and access-related procedures. Results We included 14 trials (1,390 participants; follow-up, 6-38 months). Relative to deferred salvage, preemptive correction of AV access stenosis had a nonsignificant effect on risk for access loss (risk ratio [RR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65-1.02; I2 = 0%) and a significant effect on risk for thrombosis (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; I2 = 30%). Treatment effects were larger in fistulas than in grafts for both risk for access loss (subgroup difference, P = 0.05) and risk for thrombosis (subgroup difference, P = 0.002). Results were heterogeneous or imprecise for mortality, rates of access-related infections or procedures, and hospitalization. Limitations Small number and size of primary studies limited analysis power. Conclusions Preemptive stenosis correction in a functional AV access does not improve access longevity. Although preemptive stenosis correction may be promising in fistulas, existing evidence is insufficient to guide clinical practice and health policy. ? 2016 National Kidney Foundation, Inc."

However, recent clinical trials of intentional hypocaloric feeding question this approach. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the outcomes of ICU patients randomized to intentional hypocaloric or normocaloric goals. We included randomized controlled trials that enrolled ICU patients and compared intentional hypocaloric with normocaloric nutritional goals. We included studies that evaluated both trophic feeding as well as permissive underfeeding. Data sources included MEDLINE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials and citation review of relevant primary and review articles. The outcomes of interest included hospital acquired infection, hospital mortality, ICU length of stay (LOS) and ventilator-free days (VFDs). Results: Six studies which enrolled 2517 patients met our inclusion criteria. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) across the studies were 53?¡Ó?5?years and 29.1?¡Ó?1.5?kg/m2, respectively. Two studies compared normocaloric feeding (77?% of goal) with trophic feeding (20?% of goal), while four studies compared normocaloric feeding (72?% of goal) with permissive underfeeding (49?% of goal). Overall, there was no significant difference in the risk of infectious complications (OR 1.03; 95?% CI 0.84¡V1.27, I2?=?16?%), hospital mortality (OR 0.91; 95?% CI 0.75¡V1.11, I2?=?8?%) or ICU LOS (mean difference 0.05?days; 95?% CI 1.33¡V1.44?days; I2?=?37?%) between groups.

This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of trainee operator status on clinical outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Methods Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for studies that reported CABG outcomes according to the training status of the primary operator (consultant vs trainee). Data were independently extracted by 2 investigators; a meta-analysis was conducted according to predefined clinical endpoints. Results Sixteen observational studies (n = 52,966) met criteria for inclusion, with 8 studies (n = 36,479) reporting propensity-adjusted analyses. Trainee cases were associated with increased aortic crossclamp duration (mean difference: 4.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-8.83) and cardiopulmonary bypass duration (mean difference: 4.24; 95% CI, 0.00-8.47). Perioperative mortality was similar for CABG performed primarily by trainees versus consultants (odds ratio 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81-1.18). No significant difference was found in the incidence of perioperative stroke, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, reoperation for bleeding, or wound infection. Trainee operator status was not associated with increased midterm mortality (hazard ratio 1.00; 95% CI, 0.90-1.11). In subgroup analysis that included 5 studies and 8025 patients, off-pump CABG trainee cases were not associated with increased perioperative mortality or morbidity. Conclusions With appropriate supervision, conventional CABG can be performed by trainee surgeons without an adverse impact on perioperative outcomes or midterm survival. Data regarding off-pump CABG are limited, and further research is warranted to ascertain the impact of trainee operator status on long-term outcomes after off-pump CABG. ? 2016 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery."

While MM remains incurable, consolidation and maintenance therapy aimed at improving duration of response can potentially improve survival outcomes. A majority of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated benefit of IMiD-based maintenance therapy in delaying disease progression; however, whether this therapy can lead to improved survival remains controversial. Methods: PubMed and abstract databases of major hematology and/or oncology meetings were searched for RCTs that studied maintenance therapy with IMiDs in MM. A meta-analysis was conducted to systematically evaluate the impact of IMiD-based maintenance therapy on survival outcomes and serious adverse events associated with the therapy. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Eighteen phase 3 RCTs enrolling 7730 patients were included. IMiD-based maintenance therapy statistically significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57 to 0.67, P <. 001) but failed to improve overall survival (OS; HR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.01, P =. 082). Stratified analyses demonstrated that both thalidomide and lenalidomide provided PFS but not OS benefit in transplantation as well as nontransplantation settings. IMiD-based maintenance therapy in MM led to a higher risk of grade 3-4 thromboembolism (risk ratio = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.41 to 4.52, P =. 002). Thalidomide maintenance therapy increased the risk of peripheral neuropathy; lenalidomide maintenance therapy increased the risks of myelosuppression and second primary hematological malignancies. Conclusions: Thalidomide- or lenalidomide-based maintenance therapy improves PFS but not OS in MM and increases risks of grade 3-4 adverse events, including thromboembolism, peripheral neuropathy, neutropenia, and infection. ? 2015 The Author 2015.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Setting Not applicable. Patient(s) Forty single-arm open-label studies among HIV-discordant couples that underwent intrauterine insemination (IUI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using washed semen. Intervention(s) Semen washing followed by IUI, IVF, or IVF/ICSI. Main Outcome Measure(s) Primary outcome: HIV transmission to HIV-uninfected women; secondary outcomes: HIV transmission to newborns and proportion of couples achieving a clinical pregnancy. Result(s) No HIV transmission occurred in 11,585 cycles of assisted reproduction with the use of washed semen among 3,994 women. Among the subset of HIV-infected men without plasma viral suppression at the time of semen washing, no HIV seroconversions occurred among 1,023 women after 2,863 cycles of assisted reproduction with the use of washed semen. Studies that measured HIV transmission to infants reported no cases of vertical transmission. Overall, 56.3% of couples (2,357/4,184) achieved a clinical pregnancy with the use of washed semen. Conclusion(s) Semen washing appears to significantly reduce the risk of transmission in HIV-discordant couples desiring children, regardless of viral suppression in the male partner. There are no randomized controlled studies or studies from low-income countries, especially those with a large burden of HIV. Continued development of lower-cost semen washing and assisted reproduction technologies is needed. Integration of semen washing into HIV prevention interventions could help to further reduce the spread of HIV. ? 2016 The Authors."

However, limitations in these prognostic scores have led to increasing interest in finding biomarkers that might provide additional information. To date, the role of these biomarkers has not been fully elucidated. Methods: We systematically searched the Medline, Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, and LILACS databases. We included studies that assessed the accuracy of biomarkers for the prediction of in-hospital or ?30-day mortality, in hospitalized adults with CAP. Two independent investigators extracted patient and study characteristics, which were thereafter pooled using a random effects model. Relationships between sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers and prognostic scores were plotter using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results: We included 24 articles and 2 databases from 1069 reviewed abstracts, which provided 10,319 patients for analysis. Reported mortality rates varied from 2.4% to 34.6%. The highest AUC values for predicting mortality were associated with pro-adrenomedullin (0.80) and prohormone forms of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.79), followed by cortisol (0.78), procalcitonin (0.75), copeptin (0.71), and C-reactive protein (0.62). There were no statistically significant differences between the AUCs of the studied biomarkers, other than for copeptin and C-reactive protein, which performed comparatively poorly. When compared with the CAP-specific scores, the AUCs were not significantly different from those of most biomarkers. Conclusions: The identified biomarkers are able to predict mortality with moderate to good accuracy in CAP. However, biomarkers have no clear advantage over CAP-specific scores for predicting mortality. ? 2016 The British Infection Association."

Hearing impairment is highly prevalent and potentially reversible, as it can be easily diagnosed and sometimes improved. Insight in the association between hearing impairment and psychosis can therefore contribute to prevention of psychosis. This paper provides meta-analyses of all epidemiologic evidence on the association between hearing impairment and psychosis and summarizes mechanisms that potentially underlie this relationship.Meta-analyses showed an increased risk of hearing impairment on all psychosis outcomes, such as hallucinations (OR 1.40(95%CI 1.18-1.65; n=. 227,005)), delusions (OR 1.55(95%CI 1.36-1.78; n=. 250,470)), psychotic symptoms (OR 2.23(95%CI 1.83-2.72; n=. 229,647) and delirium (OR 2.67(95%CI 2.05-3.48; n=. 12,432). Early exposure to hearing impairment elevated the risk of later development of schizophrenia (OR 3.15(95%CI 1.25-7.95; n=. 50,490)).Potential mechanisms underlying this association include loneliness, diminished theory of mind, disturbances of source monitoring and top-down processing and deafferentiation.

No significant difference was found in the serum creatinine between the two groups (WMD = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.12-0.03). Conclusions: Ileal neobladder seems able to provide more favorable patient's satisfaction, while sigmoid neobladder may provide a better chance of spontaneous voiding. This meta-analysis may provide some useful evidences for urological surgeons to choose the ideal bladder substitute for patients underwent radical cystectomy. ? 2016 IJS Publishing Group Limited."

However, their efficacy and safety compared with transforaminal epidural local anesthetics (LAs) or saline injections is unclear. METHODS: We reviewed randomized controlled trials that compared TFE injections of steroids (with or without LA) with LA or saline in adult outpatients with lumbosacral radicular pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disks. Databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Google Scholar up to February 2015. Data on scores of numerical rating scale for pain, validated scores for measuring physical disability and quality of life, and incidence of surgery measured at 1 month to 2 years after the interventions were meta-Analyzed. Strength of evidence was classified with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials including 771 patients (366 in steroid and 405 in comparator groups) were included. There was variability in the studies in the dose of TFE steroids, frequency, and number of procedures. Patients who received TFE steroids reported a significant, but clinically modest, reduction in mean pain scores (0-10 scale) compared with LA/saline (-0.97 points; 95% confidence interval,-1.42 to-0.51 points; P &lt; 0.0001, I2 = 90%; GRADE weak recommendation; moderate-quality evidence) at 3 months after the interventions. TFE steroids did not decrease physical disability at 1 to 3 months after the intervention (GRADE strong recommendation ¡õ; high-quality evidence) or incidence of surgery at 12 months after the intervention (GRADE strong recommendation ¡õ; moderate-quality evidence) compared with LA/saline. CONCLUSIONS: TFE steroids provide modest analgesic benefit at 3 months in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain secondary to herniated intervertebral disks, but they have no impact on physical disability or incidence of surgery. There was a high degree of heterogeneity among the publications included in this meta-Analysis. Well-designed, large, randomized studies are required to evaluate appropriate dosages, adverse effects, number of procedures, and the effect of this intervention on psychological disability and quality of life."

Their use in influenza and malaria vaccines has resulted in a large body of evidence on their clinical safety in children. Methods: We carried out a systematic search for safety data from published clinical trials on newly adjuvanted vaccines in children ?10 years of age. Serious adverse events (SAEs), solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs and AEs of special interest were evaluated for four new adjuvants: the immuno-stimulants containing adjuvant systems AS01 and AS02, and the squalene containing oil-in-water emulsions AS03 and MF59. Relative risks (RR) were calculated, comparing children receiving newly adjuvanted vaccines to children receiving other vaccines with a variety of antigens, both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted. Results: Twenty-nine trials were included in the meta-analysis, encompassing 25,056 children who received at least one dose of the newly adjuvanted vaccines. SAEs did not occur more frequently in adjuvanted groups (RR 0.85, 95%CI 0.75-0.96). Our meta-analyses showed higher reactogenicity following administration of newly adjuvanted vaccines, however, no consistent pattern of solicited AEs was observed across adjuvant systems. Pain was the most prevalent AE, but often mild and of short duration. No increased risks were found for unsolicited AEs, febrile convulsions, potential immune mediated diseases and new onset of chronic diseases. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis did not show any safety concerns in clinical trials of the newly adjuvanted vaccines in children ?10 years of age. An unexplained increase of meningitis in one Phase III AS01-adjuvanted malaria trial and the link between narcolepsy and the AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine illustrate that continued safety monitoring is warranted. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The objective is to determine the direct and short-term impact of one, two and three doses of any pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) formulation on nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), the otopathogens targeted by current PCVs. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) to 29 September 2015. We also scanned reference lists of recent reviews and contacted authors. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a PCV schedule commencing ?3 months of age that reported controlled non-cumulative group-specific prevalence data for carriage of Spn or NTHi at age &lt; 12 months. We performed a standard risk of bias assessment. We estimated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for each vaccine dose on NP carriage by meta-analysis. Results: We included 16 RCTs involving 14,776 participants. The PCVs were conjugated to diphtheria toxin CRM197, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid or NTHi protein D and varied in valency (4-13). Controls were non-PCVs, placebo or no vaccine. The earliest carriage outcome was from 2 to 9 months of age. Compared to controls, there were no significant differences between one or two doses of PCV on vaccine-type (VT) pneumococcal carriage at ~4 and ~6 months respectively. However, VT carriage was significantly lower at ~7 months RR 0.67 95%CI 0.56-0.81 from 9 studies and 7613 infants and non-vaccine type (NVT) carriage was higher RR 1.23 95%CI 1.09-1.40 from 8 studies and 5861 infants. No impact on overall pneumococcal or NTHi carriage was found. Conclusions: The primary PCV schedule had no significant short-term impact on overall pneumococcal or NTHi NP carriage and a limited impact on VT pneumococcal carriage before the third dose. ? 2015 The Authors."

Probiotics or synbiotics are a potential prevention strategy. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of probiotics/synbiotics for reducing postoperative infection risk following abdominal surgery. Methods: We searched AMED, Central, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and grey literature for randomized controlled trials of elective abdominal surgery patients administered probiotics or synbiotics compared to placebo or standard care. Primary outcome was SSIs. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, respiratory tract infections (RTIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), combined infections, length of hospital stay, and mortality. Using random-effects meta-analyses, we estimated the relative risk (RR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Tests were performed for heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the overall evidence quality was graded. Findings: We identified 20 trials (= 1374 participants) reporting postoperative infections. Probiotics/synbiotics reduced SSIs (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41-0.98; N = 15 studies), UTIs (RR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15-0.57; N = 11), and combined infections (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35-0.70; N = 18). There was no difference between groups for adverse events (RR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.61-1.30; N = 6), RTIs (RR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.36-1.00; N = 14), length of stay (MD: -1.19; 95% CI: -2.94 to 0.56; N = 12), or mortality (RR: 1.20; 95% CI: 0.58-2.48; N = 15). Conclusion: Our review suggests that probiotics/synbiotics reduce SSIs and UTIs from abdominal surgeries compared to placebo or standard of care, without evidence of safety risk. Overall study quality was low, owing mostly to imprecision (few patients and events, or wide CIs); thus larger multi-centered trials are needed to further assess the certainty in this estimate. ? 2016 The Healthcare Infection Society."

Some reports indicated a higher HPV prevalence in Chinese LC patients, which remains to be established due to small study sample sizes. The aim of this study was to estimate the HPV infection rate in Chinese LC patients and assess the LC risk conferred by high-risk subtype HPV infection by meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, the Embase Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, and VIP Database for studies published in either English or Chinese up to October 2013, and systematically reviewed 28 original research articles that met the inclusion criteria. Both the HPV infection rate in the LC group (all 28 studies) and the LC risk from high-risk HPV infection (a subgroup of 12 case¡Vcontrol studies) were analyzed by R 3.0 software. Overall HPV, HPV-16/18, and HPV-6/11 infection rates were 32?% (95?% CI 22¡V44?%), 30?% (95?% CI 24¡V37?%), and 12?% (95?% CI 9¡V17?%), respectively.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016,Irish Journal of Medical Science,10.1007/s11845-015-1381-7,26560110,"Introduction: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the main causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Appendectomy for acute appendicitis is one of the most commonly performed surgical interventions worldwide. The use of ring retractors to protect the wound edge from contaminated intra-abdominal contents may be an effective method to reduce SSI. Aim: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine whether the use of wound ring retractors reduces SSI rates after open appendectomy. Methods: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analysis of ring retractors was undertaken using the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane RCTs Central Register, CINAHL, and ISRCTN registry were searched for eligible studies. Only studies in which open appendectomy was undertaken were included. The Cochrane Collaboration¡¦s RevMan 5.3 was used for analysis. A subgroup analysis by degree of appendiceal inflammation was performed. Results: Four RCTs inclusive of 939 patients met eligibility requirements. One trial used single ring while three used double ring protectors. Differences in the definition of SSI, skin preparation, and type and duration of prophylactic antibiotic were found between the 4 studies. The use of ring retractors show some evidence of SSI reduction risk ratio 0.44 [95?% CI (0.21, 0.90)]. On sub-analysis, ring retractor was more effective in more severe degrees of appendiceal inflammation i.e., the contaminated group. Conclusion: Our review suggests some benefit in using ring retractors to reduce SSI post appendectomy; however the small number and variable quality of the studies suggest the need for more RCTs to confirm these results. ? 2015, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland."

A structured literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. Studies comparing surgical excision of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease with versus without a gentamicin collagen sponge were included. Outcome measures were surgical site infection, wound healing, and recurrence. The search strategy yielded six studies with a total of 669 patients. Three randomized controlled trials, comparing excision of pilonidal sinus disease and primary wound closure with versus without gentamicin collagen sponge, were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (319 patients), demonstrating a trend towards reduced surgical site infections after administration of gentamicin collagen sponge [absolute risk reduction 20?%, 95?%-confidence interval (CI) 1¡V41?%, p?=?0.06].

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in treating MDR-AB infections. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 20 September 2015. Studies evaluating the efficacy and/or safety of tigecycline in treating MDR-AB infections were included. PRISMA guidelines were followed and the I2 method was used for heterogeneity. Seven controlled and seventeen single-arm studies were included. No significant difference was noted when tigecycline was compared with control groups in terms of all-cause mortality (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.50-1.52; P = 0.63) and clinical response (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 0.61-4.05; P = 0.34). Subgroup analysis indicated that treatment with tigecycline was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.04-2.35; P = 0.03). Compared with controls, tigecycline had a significantly lower microbial eradication rate (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.07-0.59; P = 0.003) and trend for longer hospital stay (mean difference, 4.69 days, 95% CI -0.17 to 9.55 days; P = 0.06). In comparison with monotherapy, tigecycline combination therapy did not affect mortality, clinical response or microbiological response. Tigecycline was well tolerated in the patient populations studied. The pooled rates of resistance emergence and superinfection during treatment were 12.47% and 19.11%, respectively. These findings disfavour the use of a tigecycline-based regimen for the treatment of MDR-AB infections.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we compared the VSGS and VAD regarding complication rates, ventriculoperitoneal shunt conversion and infection rates, and mortality and long-term disability. Methods: The review was registered with the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42015019750) and was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results and conclusions: The literature search of five databases identified 338 publications, of which 5 met the inclusion criteria. All were retrospective cohort studies (evidence class 3b and 4). A significantly lower proportion of patients with a VSGS required CSF tapping compared to patients with a VAD (log OR ?4.43, 95?% CI ?6.14 to ?2.72). No other significant differences between the VAD and VSGS were identified in their rates of infection (log OR 0.03, 95?% CI ?0.77 to 0.84), obstruction (log OR 1.25, 95?% CI ?0.21 to 2.71), ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence (log OR ?0.06, 95?% CI ?0.93 to 0.82), subsequent shunt infection (log OR 0.23, 95?% CI ?0.61 to 1.06), mortality (log OR 0.37, 95?% CI ?0.95 to 1.70) or long-term disability (p?=?0.9). In all studies, there was a lack of standardised criteria, variations between surgeons in heterogeneous cohorts of limited sample size and a lack of neurodevelopmental follow-up.

Yet, two high-quality trials reached different conclusions about its effectiveness. Objective: To assess the overall evidence on the effectiveness of the central line bundle and also to illustrate issues related to appraising the effectiveness of QI interventions. Methods: We searched the English-language literature (MEDLINE to Sept 2014) for prospective evaluations of the central line bundle (hand hygiene, chlorhexidine skin antisepsis, maximum sterile barrier precautions, optimal catheter site selection, daily review of line necessity) on CLABSI. Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were calculated using a random effects model. Risk of bias was assessed on five domains: comparability of subjects, definition of intervention, assessment of outcome, statistical analysis and co-interventions/heterogeneity. Strength of the evidence was assessed following the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, a widely recommended framework for assessing the robustness of treatment effect and the likelihood of change as a result of future studies. Results: Across 59 studies, the central line bundle effectively reduced CLABSI by 56% (relative risk 0.44 (95% CI 0.39 to 0.50)). Studies that assessed bundle compliance at the individual patient level reported slightly higher reductions than other studies. Considerable heterogeneity was present in most subgroups. Most studies had unclear or high risk of bias, with only six (10%) studies exhibiting low risk of bias on at least four domains without any high risk. In this subset of higher-quality studies, the reduction was 52% (95% CI 32% to 66%) without heterogeneity. Applying the GRADE framework, the overall strength of the evidence was low, but moderate in quality for the six high-quality studies. This rating is typically interpreted as meaning that further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate. Conclusions: That the central line bundle could receive only a moderate evidence rating may suggest that the GRADE framework, developed mostly for traditional clinical therapies, requires modification for QI interventions. GRADE does not distinguish prospective trials (eg, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series) from lower-level observational studies. On the other hand, that the two highest quality studies reached different conclusions makes it difficult to conclude that future research would not change the effect estimate, especially given evidence of secular trends and the variability of co-interventions to ensure bundle compliance, which created heterogeneity across studies. ? 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

To characterize hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiology and assess country-specific population-level HCV prevalence in four countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Methods. Reports of HCV prevalence were systematically reviewed as per PRISMA guidelines. Pooled HCV prevalence estimates in different risk populations were conducted when the number of measures per risk category was at least five. Results. We identified 101 prevalence estimates. Pooled HCV antibody prevalence in the general population in Somalia, Sudan and Yemen was 0.9% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.3%-1.9%), 1.0% (95%CI: 0.3%-1.9%) and 1.9% (95%CI: 1.4%-2.6%), respectively. The only general population study from Djibouti reported a prevalence of 0.3% (CI: 0.2%-0.4%) in blood donors. In high-risk populations (e.g., haemodialysis and haemophilia patients), pooled HCV prevalence was 17.3%(95%CI: 8.6%-28.2%) in Sudan. In Yemen, three studies of haemodialysis patients reported HCV prevalence between 40.0%-62.7%. In intermediate-risk populations (e.g. healthcare workers, in patients and men who have sex with men), pooled HCV prevalence was 1.7% (95%CI: 0.0%-4.9%) in Somalia and 0.6% (95% CI: 0.4%-0.8%) in Sudan. Conclusion. National HCV prevalence in Yemen appears to be higher than in Djibouti, Somalia, and Sudan as well as most other MENA countries; but otherwise prevalence levels in this subregion are comparable to global levels. The high HCV prevalence in patients who have undergone clinical care appears to reflect ongoing transmission in clinical settings. HCV prevalence in people who inject drugs remains unknown.

There was also no difference of DGE incidence if only pylorus-preserving PD was considered and between the DGE grades A, B or C. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that antecolic reconstruction after PD is not superior to retrocolic reconstruction in terms of DGE. ? 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Randomized controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of new therapeutic modalities are of high priority, and the definition of the design of such trials raises debate about the use of placebo as a comparator. To support the use of placebo as a comparator, two main points need to be addressed: 1- the cure rate without any therapeutic intervention and 2- the damage caused by CL and its impact on patients. Objective The aim of this study was to systematically assess the spontaneous cure rate for American CL and to broaden the discussion about placebo use in CL trials. Methods The PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and the Cochrane manual were followed. The sources used were the PubMed and LILACS databases. Studies were included if they reported cure rates using placebo or no treatment in American CL. Results Thirteen studies of a total of 352 patients were ultimately included in this review. The summarized global cure rates for all Leishmania species according to the intention-to-treat analyses performed at approximately three (""initial cure"") and nine (""definitive cure"") months after ""no treatment"" or placebo use were 26% (CI95%: 16 to 40%) and 26% (CI95%:16 to 38%), respectively. Notably, a significantly lower cure rate was observed for L. braziliensis infection (6.4%, CI95%:0.2 to 20%) than for L. mexicana infection (44%, CI95%:19 to 72%), p = 0.002. Of note, relapse occurred in 20% of patients with initial healing (CI95%:9.2 to 38.9%). Conclusion These results clearly demonstrate a low spontaneous cure rate following no-treatment or placebo use, confirming that this strategy for the control group in CL studies expose patients to greater morbidity, especially for CL caused by L. braziliensis. Therefore, from this point, the crucial questionto consider regarding placebo use isthe seriousness of the suffering caused by this disease. ? 2016 Cota et al.

Multiple methods have been proposed to relieve this pressure and thus enhance wound healing and potentially prevent relapse. We aimed in this systematic review to find the best available evidence for off-loading methods. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and Scopus through October 2011. Pairs of independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. Predefined outcomes of interest included complete wound healing, time to complete wound healing, amputation, infection, and relapse rates. Results We identified 19 interventional studies, of which 13 were randomized controlled trials, including data from 1605 patients with diabetic foot ulcers using an off-loading method. The risk of bias in the included studies was moderate. This analysis demonstrated improved wound healing with total contact casting over removable cast walker, therapeutic shoes, and conventional therapy. There was no advantage of irremovable cast walkers over total contact casting. There was improved healing with half-shoe compared with conventional wound care. Therapeutic shoes and insoles reduced relapse rate in comparison with regular footwear. Data were sparse regarding other off-loading methods. Conclusions Although based on low-quality evidence (ie, evidence warranting lower certainty), benefits are demonstrated for use of total contact casting and irremovable cast walkers in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Reduced relapse rate is demonstrated with various therapeutic shoes and insoles in comparison with regular footwear. ? 2016 Society for Vascular Surgery."

A systematic search of English-language articles was performed using PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane Library to identify studies. The diagnostic value of PCT in predicting prognosis was determined using a bivariate meta-analysis model. The Q-test and I2 index were used to test heterogeneity. A total of 21 studies comprising 6007 patients were included. An elevated PCT level was a risk factor for death from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (risk ratio (RR) 4.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.98-6.43), particularly in patients with a low CURB-65 score. The commonly used cut-off, 0.5 ng/mL, had low sensitivity (SEN) and was not able to identify patients at high risk of dying. Furthermore, the PCT assay with functional SEN &lt;0.1 ng/mL was necessary to predict mortality in CAP in the clinic. For critically ill patients, an elevated PCT level was associated with an increased risk of mortality (RR 4.18, 95% CI: 3.19-5.48).

As a result, previous advice and guidelines need to be critically reviewed, especially with regard to transmission risks in different contexts. Methods: Scientific and grey literature were searched for articles about any African filovirus. Articles were screened for information about transmission (prevalence or odds ratios especially). Data were extracted from eligible articles and summarized narratively with partial meta-analysis. Study quality was also evaluated. Results: A total of 31 reports were selected from 6552 found in the initial search. Eight papers gave numerical odds for contracting filovirus illness; 23 further articles provided supporting anecdotal observations about how transmission probably occurred for individuals. Many forms of contact (conversation, sharing a meal, sharing a bed, direct or indirect touching) were unlikely to result in disease transmission during incubation or early illness. Among household contacts who reported directly touching a case, the attack rate was 32% [95% confidence interval (CI) 26-38%]. Risk of disease transmission between household members without direct contact was low (1%; 95% CI 0-5%). Caring for a case in the community, especially until death, and participation in traditional funeral rites were strongly associated with acquiring disease, probably due to a high degree of direct physical contact with case or cadaver. Conclusions: Transmission of filovirus is unlikely except through close contact, especially during the most severe stages of acute illness. More data are needed about the context, intimacy and timing of contact required to raise the odds of disease transmission. Risk factors specific to urban settings may need to be determined. ?

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all comparative trials, both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized. Our search yielded 15 trials recruiting 1830 patients. Four trials were RCTs and 11 were either one-arm intervention trials compared with historical controls or retrospective studies. There was a lower risk for non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days in patients given Bu-Flu regimen compared with those given Bu-Cy regimen (relative risk (RR) 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.92, 8 trials); however, there were no differences in all-cause mortality at 100 days (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.56-1.30, 9 trials) and at the end of study (RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.64-1.02, 13 trials). The risks of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and microbiologically documented infections were lower in patients given Bu-Flu regimen (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19-0.62, 8 trials and RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64-0.97, 2 trials, respectively); however, risk for SOS was no longer lower when performing sensitivity analysis according to RCTs. Engraftment kinetics, risk of grade 3-4 mucositis, GvHD, relapse and NRM at the end of the study were all similar between the two groups.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database for Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials enrolling patients who were transfused fresher vs older RBCs and reported outcomes of death, adverse events, and infection. Independently and in duplicate, reviewers determined eligibility, risk of bias, and abstracted data. We conducted random effects meta-analyses and rated certainty (quality or confidence) of evidence using the GRADE approach. Of 12 trials that enrolled 5229 participants, 6 compared fresher RBCs with older RBCs and 6 compared fresher RBCs with current standard practice. There was little or no impact of fresher vs older RBCs on mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-1.14; P 5.45; I2 5 0%, moderate certainty evidence) or on adverse events (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.91-1.14; P =.74; I2= 0%, low certainty evidence).

Methods: Seven databases were searched to identify studies reporting causes of hospitalizations among PLHIV from 1 January 2007 to 31 January 2015 irrespective of age, geographical region or language. The proportion of hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality attributable to TB was estimated using random effects meta-analysis. Results: From an initial screen of 9049 records, 66 studies were identified, providing data on 35,845 adults and 2792 children across 42 countries. Overall, 17.7% (95% CI 16.0 to 20.2%) of all adult hospitalizations were because of TB, making it the leading cause of hospitalization overall; the proportion of adult hospitalizations because of TB exceeded 10% in all regions except the European region. Of all paediatric hospitalizations, 10.8% (95% CI 7.6 to 13.9%) were because of TB. There was insufficient data among children for analysis by region. In-hospital mortality attributable to TB was 24.9% (95% CI 19.0 to 30.8%) among adults and 30.1% (95% CI 11.2 to 48.9%) among children.

Objective This current systematic review aimed to evaluate the available evidence for the association between the AUC0-24 /MIC ratio of vancomycin and its clinical effectiveness on hospitalized patients and to confirm the existing target value of 400. Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences, the Cochrane Library and two Chinese literature databases (CNKI, CBM) were systematically searched. Manual searching was also applied. Both RCTs and observational studies comparing the clinical outcomes of high AUC0-24 /MIC groups versus low AUC42-0/MIC groups were eligible. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. The primary outcomes were mortality and infection treatment failure. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated. Results No RCTs were retrieved. Nine cohort studies were included in the meta-analysis. Mortality rates were significantly lower in high AUC42-0/MIC groups (RR = 0.47, 95%CI = 0.31-0.70, p<0.001). The rates of infection treatment failure were also significantly lower in high AUC/ MIC groups and were consistent after correcting for heterogeneity (RR = 0.39, 95%CI = 0.28-0.55, p = 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that results were consistent whether MIC values were determined by broth microdilution (BMD) method or Etest method. In studies using the BMD method, breakpoints of AUC42-0/MIC all fell within 85% to 115% of 400. Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrated that achieving a high AUC0-24 /MIC of vancomycin could significantly decrease mortality rates by 53% and rates of infection treatment failure by 61%, with 400 being a reasonable target. ? 2016 Men et al.

Purpose: To determine the risk for HBV reactivation with and without antiviral prophylaxis and the effectiveness of prophylaxis in adults with solid tumors and chronic or resolved HBV infection. Data Sources: MEDLINE through 1 July 2015 and Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, TOXNET, and Scopus through 1 March 2015. Study Selection: 26 English-language observational studies and randomized, controlled trials in patients with chronic or resolved HBV receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors. Data Extraction: Study characteristics, quality, and risk of bias were assessed by 1 researcher and verified by another independent researcher. Data Synthesis: Random-effects model meta-analyses were used to estimate the risk and odds ratio (OR) of reactivation with versus without antiviral prophylaxis. Reactivation in chronic HBV without prophylaxis ranged from 4% to 68% (median, 25%) with substantial heterogeneity. Prophylaxis reduced the risk for HBV reactivation (OR, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.06 to 0.22]), HBV-related hepatitis (OR, 0.18 [CI, 0.10 to 0.32]), and chemotherapy interruption (OR, 0.10 [CI, 0.04 to 0.27]). In 3 studies of patients with resolved HBV infection, none received HBV prophylaxis and reactivation risk ranged from 0.3% to 9.0%. Limitations: Significant heterogeneity in underlying study populations and treatment regimens, incomplete baseline data, possibility of publication bias, and limited study quality. Most studies were observational and from Asia. Conclusion: In patients with chronic HBV receiving solid tumor chemotherapy, the risk for HBV reactivation is similar to the risk with other types of immunosuppressive therapy. Results support HBV screening and antiviral prophylaxis before initiation of chemotherapy for solid tumors.

Results: Eighteen cluster RCTs were identified; 13 school-based, 5 in child day care facilities or preschools. Studies were heterogeneous and had significant quality issues including small numbers of clusters and participants and inadequate randomisation. Individual study results suggest interventions may reduce children's absence, RT infection incidence and symptoms, and laboratory confirmed influenza-like illness. Evidence of impact on GI infection or symptoms was equivocal. Conclusions: Studies are generally not well executed or reported. Despite updating existing systematic reviews and identifying new studies, evidence of the effect of hand hygiene interventions on infection incidence in educational settings is mostly equivocal but they may decrease RT infection among children.

We performed a randomeffects meta-analysis and quantified heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We followed Cochrane Collaboration guidelines in conducting our review and PRISMA guidelines in reporting results. Results and discussion: We screened 3925 articles and identified 17 relevant publications. A meta-analysis found no evidence of increased HIV VL associated with HCV co-infection or between HIV VL and HCV treatment with pegylated interferon-alpha-2a/b and ribavirin. Conclusions: This finding is in contrast to the substantial increases in HIV VL observed with several other systemic infections. It presents opportunities to elucidate the biological pathways that underpin epidemiological synergy in HIV co-infections and may enable prediction of which co-infections are most important to epidemic control.

The OR of halitosis between H pylori-positive patients and H pylori-negative patients was 2.85 (95% CI: 1.40-5.83; P=0.004); The RR of halitosis after successful H pylori eradication in those H pylori-infected halitosis-positive patients was 0.17 (95% CI: 0.08-0.39; P<0.0001), compared with those patients without successful H pylori eradication. And the RR of halitosis before successful H pylori eradication therapy was 4.78 (95% CI: 1.45-15.80; P=0.01), compared with after successful H pylori eradication therapy. Conclusions: There is clear evidence that H pylori infection correlates with halitosis. H pylori infection might be important in the pathophysiological mechanism of halitosis, and H pylori eradication therapy may be helpful in those patients with refractory halitosis.

Other drugs, including tinidazole (TNZ) and albendazole (ABZ) have been included in the antigiardial armamentarium. Our aim was to assess the efficacy of ABZ compared with TNZ in Giardia infections in children. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were carried out. PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and LILACS were searched electronically until February 2015. Also relevant journals and references of studies included therein were hand-searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The meta-analysis was limited to RCTs evaluating the use of ABZ compared with TNZ in children with Giardia infection. The assessed outcome was parasitological efficacy. Prediction intervals (PI) were computed to better express uncertainties in the effect estimates. Five RCTs including 403 children were included. Overall, TNZ significantly outperformed ABZ without differences between subgroups defined by ABZ dosages [relative risk, (RR) 1.61 (95% CI): (1.40-1.85); P&lt;0.0001]. The 95% prediction interval range is 1.28-2.02. There was no significant heterogeneity (I2=0%; Q-test of heterogeneity P=0.4507. The number-needed-to-treat, the average number of patients who need to be treated with TNZ to gain one additional good outcome as compared with ABZ was 4, 95% CI: 3-5.

This parasite is seen communally in bile ducts and gallbladder of ruminants and sometimes accidentally in humans. The parasite is considered to be important from both economic and veterinary aspects since it has a direct impact on liver damage and results in significant loss of protein in human diet because infected livers are removed in slaughterhouses. This parasite is prevalent in Iran, so, this study was performed to determine the rate of dicrocoeliasis infection in Iran. Materials and methods: We sought to conduct a systematic review of articles published on some databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, IranMedex, Scopus, SID, IranDoc and Magiran, between 2000-2015. Results: Our search resulted in a total of 15 reports published about the prevalence of dicrocoeliasis infection. The random effect model was used for this meta-analysis. The relative prevalence rate of dicrocoelium was 3.1% (2.2-4.2%) in sheeps, 1.3% (0.9-1.9%) in goats, and 2.1% (1.1-3.5%) in cows. Conclusion: This study revealed high prevalence of dicrocoelium dentriticum infection among domestic animal in Iran, therefore, it is necessary to follow hygiene procedures in washing vegetables and adequate monitoring are also needed in Iranian abattoirs to ensure the infected livers are removed. ? 2016, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Helicobacter pylori is a common gastric disease-inducing pathogen. Although an increasing number of recent studies have shown that H. pylori is a risk factor for liver disease, the potential association between H. pylori infection and chronic hepatitis C still remains controversial. The aim of our meta-analysis was to evaluate a potential association between H. pylori infection and chronic hepatitis C. Methods. We searched the PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases between January 1, 1994, and May 1, 2015. Results. This study included a total of 1449 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 2377 control cases. The prevalence of H. pylori was significantly higher in patients with chronic hepatitis C than in those without chronic hepatitis C. The pooled odds ratio was 2.93. In a subgroup analysis, the odds ratios were 4.48 for hepatitis C virus- (HCV-) related cirrhosis and 5.45 for hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion. Our study found a strong association between H. pylori and chronic hepatitis C, particularly during the HCV progression stage; thus, we recommend active screening for H. pylori in patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Introduction: pNPWT has been suggested as a new method to prevent wound complications, specifically SSIs, by its application on closed incisional wounds. Methods: This review was conducted as part of the development of the Global Guidelines for prevention of SSIs commissioned by World Health Organization in Geneva. PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and the World Health Organization database between January 1, 1990 and October 7, 2015 were searched. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing pNPWT with conventional wound dressings and reporting on the incidence of SSI. Meta-analyses were performed with a random effect model. GRADE Pro software was used to qualify the evidence. Results: Nineteen articles describing 21 studies (6 randomized controlled trials and 15 observational) were included in the review. Summary estimate showed a significant benefit of pNPWT over conventional wound dressings in reducing SSIs in both randomized controlled trials and observational studies, odds ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.96; P=0.04) and odds ratio of 0.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.42; P<0.00001), respectively. This translates into lowering the SSI rate from 140 to 83 (49-135) per 1000 patients and from 106 to 34 (25-47) per 1000 patients, respectively. In stratified analyses, these results were consistent in both clean and clean-contaminated procedures and in different types of surgery, however results were no longer significant for orthopaedic/trauma surgery. The level of evidence as qualified with GRADE was however low. Conclusions: Low-quality evidence indicates that prophylactic NPWT significantly reduces the risk of SSIs.

Aim To evaluate long-term (?90 days) efficacy and safety of faecal microbiota transplantation for C. difficile infection and explore the factors affecting the faecal microbiota transplantation outcomes. Methods MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE were searched and only observational studies that utilised faecal microbiota transplantation for C. difficile infection with long-term follow-up duration (?90 days) were included. Primary cure rate, overall recurrence rate and early (<90 days) and late (?90 days) recurrence rate were calculated. Results Eighteen observational studies with 611 patients were included. The primary cure rate was 91.2% (95% confidence interval, CI 86.7-94.8%). The overall recurrence rate was 5.5% (95% CI 2.2-10.3%). The early recurrence rate and late recurrence rate were 2.7% (95% CI 0.7-6.0%) and 1.7% (95% CI 0.4-4.2%) respectively. Most adverse events were expected, short-lived, self-limited and manageable. The association between faecal microbiota transplantation therapy and adverse events such as inflammatory bowel disease flare, infectious disease and autoimmune disease was a concern but remained insignificant. Old age (?65 years) was identified as a risk factor for after faecal microbiota transplantation therapy. Upper gastrointestinal administration also results in less frequent primary cure. Conclusions Faecal microbiota transplantation seems to be a highly effective and robust therapy for recurrent C. difficile infection. However, more quality studies, such as randomised controlled trials and cohort studies with control groups, are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then, meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 13 RCTs involving 3 532 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis indicated that: the incidence of SSI in the perioperative supplemental oxygen administration group was lower than that in the control group (OR=0.68, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.99, P=0.04). There were no significiant differences between both groups in incidence of atelectasis, incidence of infection requiring reoperation and 30-day mortality after surgery (all P values &gt;0.05). Conclusions Perioperative supplemental oxygen administration could further decrease the risk of SSI in patients underwent abdominal surgery with general anesthesia, and does not increase the risk of other adverse events.

A growing number of studies have suggested that the practice of transactional sex may in part explain women's heightened risk, but evidence on the association between transactional sex and HIV has not yet been synthesized. We set out to systematically review studies that assess the relationship between transactional sex and HIV among men and women in sub-Saharan Africa and to summarize the findings through a meta-analysis. Methods: The search strategy included 8 databases, hand searches in 10 journals, and searches across 17 websites and portals for organizations as informed by expert colleagues. A systematic review of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies was carried out for studies on women and men who engage in transactional sex published up through 2014. Random effects meta-analysis was used to further examine the relationship between transactional sex and prevalent HIV infection across a subset of studies with the same exposure period. Analyses were conducted separately for men and women. Results: Nineteen papers from 16 studies met our inclusion criteria. Of these 16 studies, 14 provided data on women and 10 on men. We find a significant, positive, unadjusted or adjusted association between transactional sex and HIV in 10 of 14 studies for women, one of which used a longitudinal design (relative risk (RR)=2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22 -3.48). Out of 10 studies involving men, only 2 indicate a positive association between HIV and transactional sex in unadjusted or adjusted models. The meta-analysis confirmed general findings from the systematic review (unadjusted meta-analysis findings are significant for women (n=4; pooled odds ratio (OR)=1.54, 95% CI: 1.04-2.28; I2=42.5%, p=0.156), but not for men (n=4; pooled OR=1.47, 95% CI: 0.85-2.56; I2=50.8%, p=0.107). Conclusions: Transactional sex is associated with HIV among women, whereas findings for men were inconclusive. Given that only two studies used a longitudinal approach, there remains a need for better measurement of the practice of transactional sex and additional longitudinal studies to establish the causal pathways between transactional sex and HIV. ? 2016 Wamoyi J et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

We searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials and controlled observational studies that enrolled adults ?18 years old diagnosed with chronic HBV infection who received antiviral therapy. Data extraction was done by pairs of independent reviewers. We included 73 studies, of which 59 (15 randomized controlled trials and 44 observational studies) reported clinical outcomes. Moderate-quality evidence supported the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in patients with immune active chronic HBV infection in reducing the risk of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In immune tolerant patients, moderate-quality evidence supports improved intermediate outcomes with antiviral therapy. Only very low-quality evidence informed the questions about discontinuing versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-positive patients who seroconverted from hepatitis B e antigen to hepatitis B e antibody and about the safety of entecavir versus tenofovir. Noncomparative and indirect evidence was available for questions about stopping versus continuing antiviral therapy in hepatitis B e antigen-negative patients, monotherapy versus adding a second agent in patients with persistent viremia during treatment, and the effectiveness of antivirals in compensated cirrhosis with low-level viremia.

The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the available RCTs, comparing the effect of triclosan-coated suture with uncoated suture on the incidence of SSI after elective colorectal operations. As secondary endpoint of the analysis, we considered length of hospital stay after surgery. Methods:We performed a systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register searching for RCTs published from 1990 to 2015. To conduct these meta-analyses, we followed the guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: parallel-group RCTs in adult populations reporting the closure of the abdominal wall after elective colorectal operation with triclosan-coated suture or noncoated suture, and reporting the outcomes considered in the meta-analysis. Results: Six trials including 2168 patients (1102 treated and 1066 controls) provided data on SSIs. The overall rate was 11.7% (129/1102) in the triclosan group and 13.4% (143/1066) in the control group (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.13, P=0.220). Heterogeneity among studies was moderate (I2=44.9%). No evidence of publication bias was detectable.

Results: Seven RCTs involving 964 patients met the inclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis indicated that there were no significant differences in the 2 groups in terms of total blood loss ([mean difference (MD)=-14.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): -89.21 to 59.74, P=0.7], transfusion rates [RD=-0.02, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.02, P=0.39]; no significant differences were found regarding the incidence of adverse effects such as deep venous thrombosis [DVT] [RD=0.00, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01, P=1.00], PE [RD=0.00, 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.01, P=0.71], or wound infection [RD=-0.01, 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.04, P=0.66]). The pooled results showed that the intravenous groups had a lower postoperative hemoglobin decline (MD=-0.47, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.20, P=0.0006). It was probably due to insufficient data and the varied reporting of outcomes. There was some inherent heterogeneity due to the small sample size of each primary study. Conclusion: The topical and intravenous administrations of TXA have a similar effect on the decrease of blood loss without an increased risk of complications (DVT, PE, and wound infection). Intravenous TXA administration may have a maximum efficacy. Topical TXA administration may be preferred in patients who with high risk of thromboembolic events. However, larger, high-quality RCTs are required to explore the optimal regimen, dosage, timing still in the future in order to recommend TXA widespread use in total joint arthroplasty.

Methods We electronically searched databases including PubMed, The Cochrane Library (Issue 8, 2015), Web of Science, Ovid, CBM, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Data to collect case-control studies and cohort studies about the association between use of PPIs and CDI from January 1990 to October 2015. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 47 articles involving 50 studies with 309 620 cases were included. According to whether infected by clostridium difficile or not, these cases were divided into the case group (n=15 913) and the control group (n=293 707). The result of meta-analysis showed that the CDI rate of the PPIs therapy group was higher than that of the control group (OR=1.99, 95%CI 1.72 to 2.31, P&lt;0.01, I2=87%) but a significant heterogeneity was found among studies. So subgroup analyses were performed according to the type of study design, type of patients, sample size and NOS scores of included studies. The results showed that, within different subgroups, the CDI rate of the PPIs therapy group was higher than that of the control group with significance, but the heterogeneity among studies was still existed. Conclusion Current evidence shows the use of PPI is associate with a 2-fold increase of the risk of CDI. Due to limited quality of the included studies, the above conclusion needs to be verified by more high quality studies. ? 2016 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med. All rights reserved."

Two independent reviewers conducted a literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using the DCSD and CC for the treatment of redundant prepuce or phimosis in China and abroad. Nine RCTs (1898 cases) were included. Compared with the CC group, the DCSD group had a shorter operative time (standardized mean difference [SMD] =-21.44; 95% confidence intervals [95% CIs] [-25.08,-17.79]; P < 0.00001), shorter wound healing time (SMD =-3.66; 95% CI [-5.46,-1.85]; P < 0.0001), less intraoperative blood loss (SMD =-9.64; 95% CI [-11.37,-7.90]; P < 0.00001), better cosmetic penile appearance (odds ratio [OR] =8.77; 95% CI [5.90, 13.02]; P < 0.00001), lower intraoperative pain score, lower 24-h postoperative pain score, lower incidence of infection, less incision edema, and fewer adverse events. There were no differences between the CC and DCSD groups in the incidences of dehiscence, or hematoma.

Clostridium difficile infection is a leading cause of nosocomial diarrhea in developed countries. Studies evaluating the associations of increased risk of community-acquired CDAD and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have yielded inconclusive results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the odds of NSAID exposure in patients with CDAD versus patients without CDAD in both community-based and healthcare-associated settings. Methods. Relevant observational studies indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE up to February 2015 were analyzed and data were extracted from nine studies. Of these, eight studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results. A search of the databases resulted in 987 articles. The nine studies from which data were extracted involved over 39,000 subjects. The pooled odds ratio for history of NSAID use in participants with CDAD compared with controls was 1.41 (95% CI 1.06-1.87; p < 0.01), indicating a significant increased odds of CDAD among patients exposed to NSAIDs. Conclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its nature to demonstrate the association between the use of NSAIDs and increased risk of CDAD. Further studies to evaluate if any specific types of NSAIDs can increase the risk of CDAD are warranted. ? 2016 Nitipong Permpalung et al."

1315,McRae M.P.,Therapeutic Benefits of L-Arginine: An Umbrella Review of Meta-analyses,2016,Journal of Chiropractic Medicine,10.1016/j.jcm.2016.06.002,,"Objective L-Arginine is a semi-essential amino acid that is the substrate for nitric oxide production by vascular endothelial and immune cells. Nitric oxide production by these cells is essential for both blood pressure regulation and immune regulation. However, there is much discrepancy in the literature when it comes to randomized controlled studies, and so this umbrella review of published meta-analyses was performed to examine the efficacy of L-arginine's role as a therapeutic agent. Methods There was an overall search of the literature from January 1, 1980 through December 31, 2015 of three separate databases¡XPubMed, Cochrane Library, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature¡Xusing the following search strategy: (arginine) AND (meta-analysis OR systematic review). Only English language publications were retrieved that provided quantitative statistical analysis of outcomes on blood pressure and immune function. Results The 7 meta-analyses that were included in this umbrella review reported significant positive benefits for reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive adults by 2.2 to 5.4 mm Hg and 2.7 to 3.1 mm Hg, respectively, reducing diastolic blood pressure in pregnant women with gestational hypertension by 4.9 mm Hg, and reducing the length of stay in the hospital for surgical patients; in addition, 2 of the 3 meta-analyses indicated a 40% reduction in the incidence of hospital-acquired infections. However, these positive results should be considered with caution because statistically significant heterogeneity was observed in 5 of the 7 meta-analyses. Conclusions Some evidence appears to support the benefit of L-arginine supplementation for reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive adults and reducing the incidence of hospital-acquired infections and the length of stay in the hospital for surgical patients. Given the limitations of the included studies, interpretations should be made with caution. ? 2016"

Methods: In April 2016, a systematic computer-based search was conducted in the Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Chinese Wanfang database. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the PRISMA statement criteria. The primary endpoint was the range of motion (ROM), which represents the function after TKA. The Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Bellamy (WOMAC), pain at 24 h, 48 h and 7 day and hemoglobin (Hb) at 24 h after TKA were also to assess the effect of PRP on the function and pain after TKA. The complications of infection were also compiled to assess the safety of PRP. After testing for publication bias and heterogeneity across studies, data were aggregated for random-effects modeling when necessary. Results: Ten clinical trials with 1001 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results indicated that administration of PRP significantly increase ROM at third day (mean difference (MD) = 4.05, 95% CI = 1.58-6.52; P = 0.001) and 3 month postoperatively (MD = 3.12, 95% CI = 0.94-5.29; P = 0.005). There is no statistically difference between the two groups in terms of WOMAC questionnaire score at 3 month, pain intensity at 24 h, 48 h and 7 day and Hb at 24 h after TKA. There is no statistically significant difference between the PRP versus placebo in terms of the occurrence of infection (relative risk (RR) = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.19-2.14, P = 0.464). Conclusion: Based on the current meta-analysis, PRP can limitedly increase the ROM after TKA in short and long period. What¡¦s more, PRP has no effects on the WOMAC score, pain scores and the occurrence of infection. More RCTs and high quality studies are still needed to identify the efficacy and safety of PRP after TKA. ? 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved."

Methods: Electronic databases: Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane library, and Embase from inception to June 2016 were searched. RCTs that comparing topical with IV TXA for blood loss control in patients prepared for TKA were included in this metaanalysis. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to appraise risk of bias. The primary outcomes were needed for transfusion, total blood loss, and blood loss in drainage. Secondary outcomes are hemoglobin (Hb) value at 24-hour post TKA and complication (deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and infection). The efficacy of blood loss was tested by total blood loss, drainage volume, Hb drop, and the Hb value at 24 hours after TKA. The safety was measured by the occurrence of DVT and infection. Continuous outcomes were expressed as the mean difference with the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Discontinuous outcomes were expressed as the relative risk with 95% CIs. Stata 12.0 software (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) was used for the meta-analysis. Results: A total of 14 articles involving 1390 patients were finally included for this meta-analysis. The pooled results revealed that there were no significant difference between the need for transfusion, total blood loss, blood loss in drainage, Hb value at 24-hour post TKA, the occurrence of complications (infection and DVT) between topical administration of TXA and IV TXA. Conclusion: Topical TXA has similar efficacy for blood loss control to IV TXA without sacrificing safety in TKA. However, the dose of topical TXA and IV TXA is different, thus, optimal timing and dose of TXA are still needed to explore the maximum effect of TXA. Copyright ? 2016 the Author(s).

Methods:We interrogated the databases of Pubmed, Sciencedirect and Viley online library up to March 8, 2016. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated in a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model when appropriate. Results: In total, 12 case-control studies which containing 1580 HBV-HCC cases, 2033 HBV carrier controls, 395 HBV spontaneously recovered (SR) controls and 1116 healthy controls were included. Compared with GG genotype, the genotypes GA/ AA of G308A were associated with a significantly increased HBV-HCC risk when the controls were all healthy individuals (AA vs. GG, OR 2.483, 95%CI 1.243 to 4.959; GA vs. GG, OR 1.383, 95%CI 1.028 to 1.860; GA/AA vs. GG, OR 1.381, 95%CI 1.048 to 1.820). Meanwhile, only the AA vs. GG model of G238A and HBV-HCC showed a statistic significance when the controls were healthy individuals (OR 4.776, 95%CI 1.280 to 17.819). CT genotype of TNF-a C863T could increase HBV-HCC risk whenever the controls were healthy individuals, HBV carriers or HBV recovers. Conclusion: This meta-analysis shows that AA genotype in TNF-a G308A and TNF-a G238A and CT genotype in TNF-a C863T may increase HBV-HCC risk. Therefore, HBV infection seemed to be a more important factor for tumorigenesis of HCC than genetic predisposition in G308A of TNF-a, and interaction between TNF-a C863T polymorphisms and HBV infection might be associated with increased HCC risk.

These novel agent-based regimens showed greater benefit in terms of PFS of all subgroups irrespective of whether the patient received ASCT or not. The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was 0.64 [95% CI: 0.60-0.69] (P<0.00001). Improvements of OS could be found only in the bortezomib- and thalidomide-based regimens without ASCT. The pooled HRs were 0.74 [95% CI: 0.65-0.86] (P<0.0001) and 0.80 [95% CI: 0.70-0.90] (P=0.0004), respectively. Several AEs were shown more frequently in the novel agent-based regimens compared with controls such as hematologic events (neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia), gastrointestinal infection, peripheral neuropathy, thrombosis, and embolism events. In conclusion, in spite of the AEs, novel agent-based regimens are safe and effective for the treatment of MM. ? 2016 Xiaoxue Wang et al."

Therefore, this systemic review aimed to summarize the available epidemiologic evidence to evaluate the strength of association between IR and advanced liver fibrosis in these patients. Methods: We performed a systemic literature search in PubMed, OvidSP, and MEDLINE from January 1990 to April 2015 without language restriction using the following search terms: insulin resistance, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic hepatitis C. Publication bias was assessed using the Begg and Egger tests and with a visual inspection of funnel plot. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 2 software. Results: A total of 3659 participants with HCV infection from 14 studies were included in the analysis. After adjusting for publication bias, the relative risk (RR) for significant hepatic fibrosis among HCV subjects with IR was 1.63 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.34-2.01]. Subgroup analysis by genotypes showed RR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.52-3.06) for genotype 1; however, the association was no longer significant when we analyzed the data for HCV genotype 3; RR = 1.40 (95% CI, 0.8-2.45).

Some meta-analyses of case-controlled studies (CCSs) have shown that laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LTG) had some short-term advantages over open total gastrectomy (OTG). However, postoperative complications differed somewhat among the meta-analyses, and some CCSs included in the meta-analyses had mismatched factors between LTG and OTG. Methods. CCSs comparing postoperative complications between LTG and OTG were identified in PubMed and Embase. Studies matched for patients' status, tumor stage, and the extents of lymph-node dissection were included. Outcomes of interest, such as anastomotic, other intra-abdominal, wound, and pulmonary complications, were evaluated in a meta-analysis performed using Review Manager version 5.3 software. Result. This meta-analysis included a total of 2,560 patients (LTG, 1,073 patients; OTG, 1,487 patients) from 15 CCSs. Wound complications were significantly less frequent in LTG than in OTG (n = 2,430; odds ratio [OR] 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.85, P=0.01, I2 = 0%, and OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.17-0.52, P &lt; 0.0001, I2 = 0%).

Immunosuppressive treatment regimen, except for a 6-month trial of corticosteroids, has not been approved by the KDiGO guideline yet. Specific and effective treatment is still lacking. We decided to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) in the treatment of IgAN. Methods: Database from the Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, CBM, CNKI, and CENTRAL databases were searched and reviewed up to March 2016. Literature was screened by 2 independent reviewers accordingly. Clinical trials were analyzed using Stata 12.0. Results: Five random control trials and 2 nonrandomized concurrent control trials were selected and included in this study according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The rates of complete remission in patients with IgAN were significantly increased in the group of CNIs (RR 1.56, P=0.002). No statistical difference was observed in the rates of partial remission, or response between the CNIs and steroids alone. Additionally, CNIs resulted in a significant reduction in urinary protein (WMD 0.34, P=0.002) and increase in serum albumin level (WMD 1.89, P=0.013). No differences were found in the serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and rates of adverse effects including infection, hyperglycemia, and liver dysfunction. Conclusion: With present evidence, CNIs may be promising immunosuppressive agents for IgAN in future. However, large, longterm, multicenter trials are required to confirm our findings.

However, a Cochrane Review, published in 2004, found insufficient evidence to recommend their use in this context. This updated systematic review evaluates the effects of the NADs, lactulose and lactitol, for the treatment and prevention of HE in patients with cirrhosis. Thirty-eight randomized controlled trials, involving 1,828 patients, were identified through electronic and manual searches; 31 randomized controlled trials looked at the treatment of HE, while seven looked at its primary/secondary prevention. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that, compared to placebo/no intervention, NADs had a beneficial effect on HE (relative risk [RR] = 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.74, number needed to treat [NNT] = 4) and serious liver-related adverse events such as liver failure, variceal bleeding, serious infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.26-0.69, NNT = 50). Treatment was also associated with a reduction in mortality in patients with overt HE (RR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.94, NNT = 20), although not in patients with minimal HE. Meta-analyses of the prevention randomized controlled trials showed that NADs prevented the development of HE (RR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.33-0.68, NNT = 6), the risk of developing serious liver-related adverse events (RR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.33-0.70, NNT = 6), and reduced mortality (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.40-0.98, NNT = 20). Use of NADs was associated with nonserious gastrointestinal adverse events. There were no differences in the efficacy or safety of lactulose and lactitol. Conclusions: NADs have beneficial effects in the treatment and prevention of HE; their use, in this context, confers additional benefits including a reduction in serious liver-related morbidities and all-cause mortality.

Two investigators independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan 5.3 software and Stata 12 software. Results: Seven trials including 4256 patients were analysed. Compared with placebo, two different doses of EMPA significantly reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) [10?mg: weighted mean difference (WMD) ?0.57?%; 95?% confidence interval (CI) ?0.65 to ?0.49?%, P < 0.00001; 25?mg: WMD ?0.65?%; 95 % CI ?0.72 to ?0.57?%, P < 0.00001]. Compared with active comparators (two sitagliptin, one linagliptin and one glimepiride), 10?mg of EMPA provided a similar reduction in HbA1c [WMD ?0.10?%; 95 % CI ?0.23 to 0.03?%, P = 0.13], while 25?mg of EMPA provided a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c [WMD ?0.13?%; 95 % CI ?0.20 to ?0.06?%, P = 0.0005]. In addition, EMPA as add-on to MET also had a favourable effect on body weight and blood pressure. The risk of hypoglycaemia in the EMPA group was similar to the placebo group or active comparator group. Conclusions: EMPA as add-on to MET was well tolerated and provided additional benefits beyond glucose lowering, such as weight loss and blood pressure reduction.

The clinical impact of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics has been shown in the monitoring and treatment of a variety of infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. The objective of this systematic review is to investigate the impact of POC diagnostics on maternal outcomes for HIV-infected women. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review to evaluate the impact of POC diagnostics for improving desired healthcare outcomes for HIV-infected women. The search strategy will involve electronic databases including: Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialised Register; Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials, published in The Cochrane Library; PubMed; EBSCOhost and LILACS. The studies will be mapped in 2 stages: stage 1 will map studies descriptively by focus and method; stage 2 will involve additional inclusion criteria, quality assessment and data extraction undertaken by 2 reviewers in parallel. Evidence will be synthesised using relevant systematic research tools: meta-analysis and subgroup analysis will be conducted using RevMan and Stata 13 will be used for meta-regressions. We will follow recommendations described in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and the Cochrane Handbook for Intervention Reviews. Ethics and dissemination: We anticipate finding a large number of studies on POC diagnostic interventions on maternal outcomes in HIV-infected women, which, once summarised, will be useful to guide future diagnostic interventions. The protocol for the systematic review has been registered in PROSPERO. The study will be disseminated electronically and in print. It will also be presented to conferences related to HIV/AIDS, POC diagnostics and maternal health. Trial registration number: PROSPERO CRD42014015439."

Objective: To perform a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of drugs targeting £^-secretase in AD. Methods: Ten trials were identified involving 5,227 patients using electronic databases and manual review of reference lists. RCTs of at least two weeks duration involving a drug targeting £^-secretase were eligible. The main outcomes examined were adverse events and cognitive measures (ADAS-cog, MMSE, ADCS-ADL, and CDR-sb). A sub-group analysis was performed, excluding the £^-secretase modulator tarenflurbil, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of £^-secretase inhibitors only. Results: There was an increased risk of adverse events (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.38, 95 CI 1.091.73; p=0.01), serious adverse events (OR 1.50, 95 CI 1.221.84; p<0.001), and skin cancers (OR 4.77, 95 CI 2.838.06; p<0.001). There was significantly increased risk of infections (OR 1.36, 95 CI 1.131.63; p<0.001) in the subgroup analysis excluding tarenflurbil. Pooled results also revealed a worsening in ADAS-cog (difference in means 1.33, 95 CI 0.582.08; p<0.001) and MMSE (difference in means 0.66, 95 CI 0.96 to 0.35; p<0.001), but not ADCS-ADL or CDR-sb. Conclusion: The use of £^-secretase inhibitors is associated with significantly increased risk of serious adverse events including skin cancers, and worsening in cognitive indicators. This evidence indicates that £^-secretase may not be an appropriate target for clinical treatment of AD."

Depression and anxiety are common mental health problems in transplant populations. There is mixed evidence concerning whether they increase morbidity and mortality risks after transplantation. If such associations exist, additional risk reduction strategiesmay be needed.Methods. Four bibliographic databases were searched from1981 through September 2014 for studies prospectively examining whether depression or anxiety (determined with diagnostic evaluations or standardized symptomscales) affected risk for posttransplant mortality, graft loss, acute graft rejection, chronic rejection, cancer, infection, and rehospitalization. Results. Twenty-seven studies (10 heart, total n = 1738; 6 liver, n = 1063; 5 kidney, n = 49515; 4 lung, n = 584; 1 pancreas, n = 80; 1 mixed recipient sample, n = 205) were identified. In each, depression and/or anxiety were typically measured before or early after transplantation. Follow-up for outcomes was a median of 5.8 years (range, 0.50-18.0). Depression increased the relative risk (RR) of mortality by 65% (RR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.34-2.05; 20 studies). Meta-regression indicated that risk was stronger in studies that did (vs did not) control for potential confounders (P = .032). Risk was unaffected by type of transplant or other study characteristics. Depression increased death-censored graft loss risk (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.21- 2.26, 3 studies). Depression was not associated with other morbidities (each morbidity was assessed in 1-4 studies). Anxiety did not significantly increase mortality risk (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.85-2.27, 6 studies) or morbidity risks (assessed in single studies). Conclusions. Depression increases risk for posttransplant mortality. Few studies considered morbidities; the depression-graft loss association suggests that linkages with morbidities deserve greater attention. Depression screening and treatment may be warranted, although whether these activities would reduce posttransplant mortality requires study. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the evidence for tacrolimus use in the management of lupus nephritis.Thirteen controlled studies were identified (9 suitable for inclusion), using Cochrane database, SCOPUS, Web of Science and OVID (MEDLINE and EMBASE). Data on complete and partial remission rates, proteinuria reduction and adverse events was extracted and analysed using RevMan software.The meta-analysis showed that overall tacrolimus is more effective at inducing complete renal remission than IVCYC (p = 0.004), but there is no significant difference compared to MMF (p = 0.87). Multi-target TAC + MMF therapy is more effective than IVCYC only when partial remission is included (p = 0.0006). Frequency of key adverse effects seems comparable to other agents used in the management of lupus nephritis with fewer gastrointestinal side effects, leukopenia, menstrual disorders, infections and episodes of liver dysfunction reported, but more new onset hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Mortality was lower in the tacrolimus groups, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.15). Tacrolimus may be more effective at reducing proteinuria, but again this was not statistically significant. There are no controlled trials looking at use in pregnancy or juvenile patients, however case reports suggest potential efficacy and safety.In conclusion, in moderately severe lupus nephritis, there is some evidence supporting efficacy of tacrolimus or multi-target TAC + MMF over IVCYC, but no evidence supporting tacrolimus over MMF. Tacrolimus may be more effective at reducing proteinuria, having potential implications for long-term outcome. Key limitations of this study are the lack of long-term outcome data and the lack of high quality, large, blinded controlled trials in multi-ethnic groups. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V."

However, men represent only approximately 41% of those receiving antiretroviral therapy globally. There has been limited study of men's outcomes in treatment programmes, despite data suggesting that men living with HIV and engaged in treatment programmes have higher mortality rates. This systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) aims to assess differential all-cause mortality between men and women living with HIV and on antiretroviral therapy in LMIC. Methods: A SR was conducted through searching PubMed, Ovid Global Health and EMBASE for peer-reviewed, published observational studies reporting differential outcomes by sex of adults (?15 years) living with HIV, in treatment programmes and on antiretroviral medications in LMIC. For studies reporting hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality by sex, quality assessment using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (cohort studies) and an MA using a random-effects model (Stata 14.0) were conducted. Results: A total of 11,889 records were screened, and 6726 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. There were 31 included studies in the final MA reporting 42 HRs, with a total sample size of 86,233 men and 117,719 women, and total time on antiretroviral therapy of 1555 months. The pooled hazard ratio (pHR) showed a 46% increased hazard of death for men while on antiretroviral treatment (1.35-1.59). Increased hazard was significant across geographic regions (sub-Saharan Africa: pHR 1.41 (1.28-1.56); Asia: 1.77 (1.42-2.21)) and persisted over time on treatment (?12 months: 1.42 (1.21-1.67); 13-35 months: 1.48 (1.23-1.78); 36-59 months: 1.50 (1.18-1.91); 61 to 108 months: 1.49 (1.29-1.71)). Conclusions: Men living with HIV have consistently and significantly greater hazards of all-cause mortality compared with women while on antiretroviral therapy in LMIC. This effect persists over time on treatment. The clinical and population-level prevention benefits of antiretroviral therapy will only be realized if programmes can improve male engagement, diagnosis, earlier initiation of therapy, clinical outcomes and can support long-term adherence and retention. ? 2016 Beckham SW et al."

To inform progress, we conducted a systematic review of pre-ART interventions aiming to increase ART initiation in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and the ISI Web of Knowledge from 1 January 2008 to 1 March 2015, extended in PubMed to 25 May 2016, for English language publications pertaining to any country in sub-Saharan Africa and reporting on general adult populations. We included studies describing interventions aimed at increasing linkage to HIV care, retention in pre-ART or uptake of ART, which reported ART initiation as an outcome. We synthesized the evidence on causal intervention effects in meta-analysis of studies belonging to distinct intervention categories. Results and discussion: We identified 22 studies, which evaluated 25 interventions and included data on 45,393 individual patients. Twelve of twenty-two studies were observational. Rapid/point-of-care (POC) CD4 count technology (seven interventions) (relative risk, RR: 1.26; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.02-1.55), interventions within home-based testing (two interventions) (RR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.36-2.92), improved clinic operations (three interventions) (RR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.25-1.48) and a package of patient-directed services (three interventions) (RR: 1.54; 95% CI: 1.20-1.97) were all associated with increased ART initiation as was HIV/TB service integration (three interventions) (RR: 2.05; 95% CI: 0.59-7.09) but with high imprecision. Provider-initiated testing (three interventions) was associated with reduced ART initiation (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86-0.97). Counselling and support interventions (two interventions) (RR 1.08; 95% CI: 0.94-1.26) had no impact on ART initiation. Overall, the evidence was graded as low or moderate quality using the GRADE criteria. Conclusions: The literature on interventions to increase uptake of ART is limited and of mixed quality. POC CD4 count and improving clinic operations show promise. More implementation research and evaluation is needed to identify how best to offer treatment initiation in a manner that is both efficient for service providers and effective for patients without jeopardizing treatment outcomes. ? 2016 Fox M P et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

Methods: Relevant articles published in English (up to July 25, 2015) were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Knowledge. The outcomes of staple line hemorrhage and leakage, overall complications, operative time were pooled. Data synthesis and statistical analysis were performed using Stata 13.1 software. Results: Eight randomized controlled trials involving 791 patients (453 cases and 338 controls) were analyzed. Compared to performing no reinforcement, staple line reinforcement was associated with a lower risk of staple line hemorrhage (RR = 0.609, 95%CI = 0.439-0.846, P = 0.003) and overall complications (RR = 0.673, 95%CI = 0.507-0.892, P = 0.006).

In the present study, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the relationship between VDR FokI gene polymorphism and the risk of TB. Material and methods: Databases including PubMed and Embase were searched for genetic association studies of FokI polymorphism of vitamin D receptor (VDR) and TB. Data were extracted by two independent authors and the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated to assess the strength of the association between VDR FokI gene polymorphism and TB risk. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Results: Thirty-four studies with a total of 5669 cases and 6525 controls were reviewed in the present meta-analysis. A statistically significant correlation was found between VDR FokI gene polymorphism and increased TB risk in two comparison models: the homozygote model (ff vs. FF: OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.17-1.60; P heterogeneity = 0.001) and the recessive model (ff vs. Ff + FF: OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.14-1.52; Pheterogeneity = 0.006). Meta-regression found no source contributing to heterogeneity. However, sub-group analyses revealed that there was a statistically increased TB risk in the East and Southeast Asian population. Conclusions: Synthesis of the available studies suggests that homozygosity for the FokI polymorphism of the VDR gene might be associated with an increased TB risk, especially in the East and Southeast Asian population.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the accuracy of hrHPV testing in the management of women with AGC to detect underlying high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia or worse, and adenocarcinoma in situ or worse (AIS+). Additionally, the diagnosis of extra-cervical cancer was considered as an outcome in this review. A bibliographic database search (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL) identified twelve eligible studies. The occurrence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade two or worse including AIS+ (CIN2+/AIS+), was 19.8% among women with AGC, and 55.7% among women with AGC and concurrent squamous lesions (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse, ASC-US+). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of hrHPV-testing with Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) to detect CIN2+/AIS+ in women with AGC was 90.0% (95% CI = 85.1-93.4%) and 75.1% (95% CI = 64.8-83.2%), respectively. Women who were hrHPV-negative, demonstrated an increased risk for extra-cervical malignancy (endometrium, fallopian tube, ovary). In women of 50y and older, a hrHPV-negative result was linked with a 18.0% chance of extra-cervical malignancy, while the chance of cervical pre-cancer and cancer was 0.4 and 0.0%, respectively. In conclusion, given the high risk of underlying CIN2+/AIS+, women with AGC should be referred directly to colposcopy. However, hrHPV test results in combination with the age, appears to improve the diagnostic process by distinguishing the risk for cervical versus non-cervical lesions. ? 2015 UICC."

Early surgical treatment is recommended, but the ideal surgical technique is debated. Our objective was to quantify the effect of different surgical interventions on maximal (interincisal) mouth opening. Methods The systematic literature search (1960-2015) was based on PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Pooled mean differences and 95% confidence intervals between pre-operative and post-operative maximal mouth opening (in mm) were calculated with random-effects meta-analyses. The surgical interventions were grouped according to increasing complexity: gap arthroplasty, interposition arthroplasty and reconstruction arthroplasty. Results Thirty-eight articles were identified (1993-2015), including 1215 patients who underwent operations; 84% of the cases were caused by trauma, and 8% by infection. Gap arthroplasty (n = 463), interposition arthroplasty (n = 409) and reconstruction arthroplasty (n = 293) resulted in improved maximal mouth opening of 26.2 mm (95% CI, 24.1-28.2), 26.7 mm (95% CI, 24.6-28.8) and 30.6 mm (95% CI, 28.7-32.5), respectively, and 28.7 mm overall (95% CI, 26.7-29.2). The mean pooled post-operative maximal mouth opening ranged between 33.0 and 36.1 mm. Conclusions The maximal mouth opening improved most after reconstruction arthroplasty, and least after gap arthroplasty. However, the post-operative maximal mouth opening was similar for all techniques. ? 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery."

We aim to identify the mesh location associated with the lowest rate of recurrence following OVHR using a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search was performed for studies comparing at least two of four locations for mesh placement during OVHR (onlay, inlay, sublay, and underlay). Outcomes assessed were hernia recurrence and surgical site infection (SSI). Pairwise meta-analysis was performed to compare all direct treatment of mesh locations. A multiple treatment meta-analysis was performed to compare all mesh locations in the Bayesian framework. Sensitivity analyses were planned for the following: studies with a low risk of bias, incisional hernias, by hernia size, and by mesh type (synthetic or biologic). Twenty-one studies were identified (n = 5,891). Sublay placement of mesh was associated with the lowest risk for recurrence [OR 0.218 (95 % CI 0.06-0.47)] and was the best of the four treatment modalities assessed [Prob (best) = 94.2 %]. Sublay was also associated with the lowest risk for SSI [OR 0.449 (95 % CI 0.12-1.16)] and was the best of the 4 treatment modalities assessed [Prob (best) = 77.3 %]. When only assessing studies at low risk of bias, of incisional hernias, and using synthetic mesh, the probability that sublay had the lowest rate of recurrence and SSI was high. Sublay mesh location has lower complication rates than other mesh locations. While additional randomized controlled trials are needed to validate these findings, this network meta-analysis suggests the probability of sublay being the best location for mesh placement is high. ? 2015 Soci?t?

Several studies have tried to identify risk factors for PPB after gastric EMR and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), with controversial results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify significant risk factors for PPB after gastric EMR and ESD. Methods Three online databases were searched. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was computed for each risk factor using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q test and I2. Results Seventy-four articles were included. Pooled PPB rate was 5.1% (95% confidence interval, 4.5%-5.7%), which did not vary according to different study designs.

Procedure duration &gt; 60 minutes (OR, 2.05) and the use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists instead of proton pump inhibitors (OR, 2.13) were the procedural factors associated with PPB, whereas endoscopist experience and preprocedural proton pump inhibitors were not. Second-look endoscopy was not associated with decreased PPB (OR, 1.34; 95% confidence interval,.85-2.12). Conclusions Risk factors for PPB were identified that can help to guide management after gastric ESD, namely adjusting further management.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic yield, morbidity, and mortality of neuroendoscopic biopsy. Methods Medline and Embase were searched for original data on outcomes of neuroendoscopic biopsy. Summary estimates were achieved by applying a random effects model as per DerSimonian-Laird. Measures of heterogeneity and publication bias were also assessed. Meta-regression was used to assess the relative effect of rigid versus flexible endoscopy on the outcomes of interest. Data on study demographics, operative variables, histopathologies of identified lesions, and clinical features of intraventricular tumors were also collected. Results A total of 30 studies with 2069 total biopsies were included. Neuroendoscopic biopsies were performed concurrently with at least 1 other procedure in 82.7% (n = 1252/1513) of procedures. Germ cell tumors, astrocytomas, and non-neoplastic lesions accounted for most of reported intraventricular lesions at 26.6% (n = 423), 25.5% (n = 406), and 12.4% (n = 198), respectively. The combined diagnostic yield of 28 studies reporting 1995 total biopsies was 87.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.1%-90.9%) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 68.0%). The combined major morbidity of 17 studies reporting 592 total biopsies was 3.1% (95% CI 1.9%-5.1%). The combined mortality of 22 studies reporting 991 total biopsies was 2.2% (95% CI 1.3%-3.6%). There was no significant heterogeneity for major morbidity and mortality (both I2 = 0). Among included studies, 50% (n = 14) reported using a rigid endoscope exclusively. The results of meta-regression demonstrated no significant differences in diagnostic yield when comparing studies using rigid versus flexible endoscopes exclusively. Conclusions These results indicate that neuroendoscopic biopsy has a very good diagnostic yield and reasonably low complication rate. The procedure seems most advantageous for diagnosis of intraventricular lesions where cerebrospinal fluid diversion is an additional therapeutic requirement. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies have described the effectiveness of ESI in the management of radiculopathy. However, controversy exists regarDing the route that is most beneficial and effective with respect to the administration of epidural steroids, as both transforaminal (TF) and caudal (C) routes are commonly used. This analysis reviewed studies comparing the effectiveness of TFESIs with that of C-ESIs in the treatment of radiculopathy as a means of proviDing pain relief and improving functionality. This meta-analysis was performed to guide clinical decision-making. The study was a systematic review of comparative studies. A systematic literature search was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for trials written in English. The randomized trials and observational studies that met our inclusion criteria were subsequently included. Two reviewers, respectively, extracted data and estimated the risk of bias. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3. Six prospective and 2 retrospective studies involving 664 patients were included. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing only the 6 prospective studies. Although slight pain and functional improvements were noted in the TF-ESI groups compared with the C-ESI groups, these improvements were neither clinically nor statistically significant. The limitations of this meta-analysis resulted primarily from the weaknesses of the comparative studies and the relative paucity of patients included in each study. Both the TF and C approaches are effective in reducing pain and improving functional scores, and they demonstrated similar efficacies in the management of lumbosacral radicular pain.

However, the benefits and adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially in severe CAP, have not been well assessed. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases from inception to May 2015 were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that evaluated use of corticosteroids in adult patients with CAP were included. The quality of outcomes was evaluated using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The Mantel-Haenszel method with random-effects modeling was used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Nine eligible RCTs (1,667 patients) and six cohort studies (4,095 patients) were identified. The mean corticosteroid dose and treatment duration were 30 mg/day methylprednisolone for 7 days. Corticosteroids did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43-1.21; evidence rank, low) in patients with CAP and patients with severe CAP (RCTs: RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.43-1.21; evidence rank, low; cohort studies: RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.86-1.17 ). Corticosteroids treatment was associated with a decreased risk of ARDS (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.08-0.59) and may reduce lengths of hospital and ICU stay, duration of IV antibiotic treatment, and time to clinical stability. Corticosteroids were not associated with increased rates of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Short-Term treatment with corticosteroids is safe and may reduce the risk of ARDS, shortening the length of the disease in patients with CAP.

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of this third-line salvage therapy. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of trials published in PubMed up to January 2015 relating to the use of third-line salvage therapy following failure of intravenous corticosteroids and infliximab or cyclosporine. Pooled outcome rates for each salvage strategy and pooled odds ratio comparing the two strategies were calculated using the random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q and I2 statistics. Results The search strategy yielded 40 articles of which 4 were eligible for inclusion. Four articles assessed patients who were treated with infliximab after failure of cyclosporine and 2 articles assessed the use of cyclosporine after failure of infliximab. There were 138 patients using infliximab as a third-line salvage therapy and 30 patients using cyclosporine. When comparing these two strategies, there was no significant difference in clinical response (RR 1.03, 95%CI 0.7-1.46 P=0.87), clinical remission (RR 0.69, 95%CI 0.30-1.57 P=0.37), or colectomy at 12 months (RR 1.14, 95%CI 0.79-1.67 P=0.48).

To construct the World Health Organization's global guidance on adherence interventions, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of using peers for achieving adequate adherence and viral suppression. Methods: We searched for randomized clinical trials of peer-based interventions to promote adherence to ART in HIV populations. We searched six electronic databases from inception to July 2015 and major conference abstracts within the last three years. We examined the outcomes of adherence and viral suppression among trials done worldwide and those specific to low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) using pairwise and network meta-analyses. Results and discussion: Twenty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. We found similar results between pairwise and network meta-analyses, and between the global and LMIC settings. Peer supporter+Telephone was superior in improving adherence than standard-of-care in both the global network (odds-ratio [OR]=4.79, 95% credible intervals [CrI]: 1.02, 23.57) and the LMIC settings (OR=4.83, 95% CrI: 1.88, 13.55). Peer support alone, however, did not lead to improvement in ART adherence in both settings. For viral suppression, we found no difference of effects among interventions due to limited trials. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that peer support leads to modest improvement in adherence. These modest effects may be due to the fact that in many settings, particularly in LMICs, programmes already include peer supporters, adherence clubs and family disclosures for treatment support. Rather than introducing new interventions, a focus on improving the quality in the delivery of existing services may be a more practical and effective way to improve adherence to ART. ? 2016 Kanters S et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

The effects on the retina are usually self limited, although some people are left with irreversible vision loss due to progressive and permanent photoreceptor damage or RPE atrophy. There have been a variety of interventions used in CSC, including, but not limited to, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. However, it is not known whether these or other treatments offer significant advantages over observation or other interventions. At present there is no evidence-based consensus on the management of CSC. Due in large part to the propensity for CSC to resolve spontaneously or to follow a waxing and waning course, the most common initial approach to treatment is observation. It remains unclear whether this is the best approach with regard to safety and efficacy. Objectives: To compare the relative effectiveness of interventions for central serous chorioretinopathy. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2015, Issue 9), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to October 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 5 October 2015. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any intervention for CSC with any other intervention for CSC or control. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We pooled data from all studies using a fixed-effect model. For interventions applied to the eye (i.e. not systemic interventions), we synthesized direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis model. Main results: We included 25 studies with 1098 participants (1098 eyes) and follow-up from 16 weeks to 12 years. Studies were conducted in Europe, North and South America, Middle East, and Asia. The trials were small (most trials enrolled fewer than 50 participants) and poorly reported; often it was unclear whether key aspects of the trial, such as allocation concealment, had been done. A substantial proportion of the trials were not masked. The studies considered a variety of treatments: anti-VEGF (ranibizumab, bevacizumab), PDT (full-dose, half-dose, 30%, low-fluence), laser treatment (argon, krypton and micropulse laser), beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, Helicobactor pylori treatment, and nutritional supplements (Icaps, lutein); there were only one or two trials contributing data for each comparison. We downgraded for risk of bias and imprecision for most analyses, reflecting study limitations and imprecise estimates. Network meta-analysis (as planned in our protocol) did not help to resolve this uncertainty due to a lack of trials, and problems with intransitivity, particularly with respect to acute or chronic CSC. Low quality evidence from two trials suggested little difference in the effect of anti-VEGF (ranibizumab or bevacizumab) or observation on change in visual acuity at six months in acute CSC (mean difference (MD) 0.01 LogMAR (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution), 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.03; 64 participants). CSC had resolved in all participants by six months. There were no significant adverse effects noted. Low quality evidence from one study (58 participants) suggested that half-dose PDT treatment of acute CSC probably results in a small improvement in vision (MD -0.10 logMAR, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.02), less recurrence (risk ratio (RR) 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.81) and less persistent CSC (RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.02) at 12 months compared to sham treatment. There were no significant adverse events noted. Low quality evidence from two trials (56 participants) comparing anti-VEGF to low-fluence PDT in chronic CSC found little evidence for any difference in visual acuity at 12 months (MD 0.03 logMAR, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.15). There was some evidence that more people in the anti-VEGF group had recurrent CSC compared to people treated with PDT but, due to inconsistency between trials, it was difficult to estimate an effect. More people in the anti-VEGF group had persistent CSC at 12 months (RR 6.19, 95% CI 1.61 to 23.81; 34 participants). Two small trials of micropulse laser, one in people with acute CSC and one in people with chronic CSC, provided low quality evidence that laser treatment may lead to better visual acuity (MD -0.20 logMAR, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.11; 45 participants). There were no significant adverse effects noted. Other comparisons were largely inconclusive. We identified 12 ongoing trials covering the following interventions: aflibercept and eplerenone in acute CSC; spironolactone, eplerenone, lutein, PDT, and micropulse laser in chronic CSC; and micropulse laser and oral mifepristone in two trials where type of CSC not clearly specified. Authors' conclusions: CSC remains an enigmatic condition in large part due to a natural history of spontaneous improvement in a high proportion of people and also because no single treatment has provided overwhelming evidence of efficacy in published RCTs. While a number of interventions have been proposed as potentially efficacious, the quality of study design, execution of the study and the relatively small number of participants enrolled and followed to revealing endpoints limits the utility of existing data. It is not clear whether there is a clinically important benefit to treating acute CSC which often resolves spontaneously as part of its natural history. RCTs comparing individual treatments to the natural history would be valuable in identifying potential treatment groups for head-to-head comparison. Of the interventions studied to date, PDT or micropulse laser treatment appear the most promising for study in future trials. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration."

Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds may be at greater need for chlamydia screening, but existing evidence on the variation of prevalence with social position is inconclusive. We carried out a systematic review to examine variation in chlamydia prevalence in populations and possible sources of this variation. Methods: Studies were eligible if they reported chlamydia prevalence derived from population-based samples that included young people aged 15-24 years from Europe, North America or Australia. Systematic searches of the following databases were undertaken from their inception to November 2014: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and PsychINFO. There were no restrictions by language or publication date. Independent screening for eligibility and data extraction were carried out by two reviewers. Where possible, data were pooled in a meta-analysis using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was further investigated using meta-regression techniques. Results: Of 1248 unique titles and abstracts and 263 potentially relevant full texts, 29 studies were eligible for inclusion. There was relatively strong evidence that disadvantaged young people had an increased risk of having a chlamydia infection across multiple measures of disadvantage, including lower educational attainment (OR 1.94, 95 % CI: 1.52 to 2.47), lower occupational class (OR 1.49, 95 % CI: 1.07 to 2.08) and residence in deprived areas (OR 1.76, 95 % CI: 1.15 to 2.71) with an overall OR of 1.66 (95 % CI: 1.37 to 2.02). Socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with chlamydia infection in both men and women. There was weaker evidence that prevalence estimates also varied by gender and age. Conclusions: This review provides evidence of a consistent association between socioeconomic disadvantage and higher risk of Chlamydia infection. This association may reflect a number of factors including social variation in engagement with Chlamydia control programmes. Chlamydia screening could therefore reduce or increase health inequalities, depending on service provision and uptake by different socioeconomic groups. ? 2015 Crichton et al."

METHODS: Bibliographical searches for randomized trials comparing hybrid and other therapies were performed in pubmed, the Cochrane Library and relevant congresses up to February 2015 using the following keywords (all fields and/or MeSH): (""Helicobacter pylori "" or ""H. pylori "") and (""hybrid therapy"" or ""sequential-concomitant therapy""). Metaanalyses were performed with Cochrane Review Manager 5.1. The random effect model proposed by DerSimonian and Laird and the Mantel-Haenszel method were used to estimate the pooled relative risk and 95%CI of the efficacy outcomes between hybrid therapy and other eradication therapies. RESULTS: Eight studies (2516 subjects) met entry criteria. The antimicrobial resistance in the study groups ranged from 6.9% to 23.5%. The mean cure rates of hybrid therapy by intention-to-treat (ITT) and perprotocol analyses were 88.5% (n = 1207; range: 80.0% to 97.4%) and 93.3% (n = 1109; range: 85.7% to 99.1%), respectively. Meta-analysis showed there was no significant difference in ITT eradication rate between hybrid and sequential therapy (relative risk: 1.01; 95%CI: 0.92-1.11). Subgroup analysis revealed hybrid therapy was more effective than sequential therapy in the non-Italian populations (95%CI: 1.01-1.18) and was only less effective in one, Italian population (95%CI: 0.83-0.98). There was no significant difference in eradication rate between hybrid therapy and concomitant therapy (95%CI: 0.93-1.02). No head-tohead comparisons of hybrid therapy and standard triple therapy or bismuth quadruple therapy were found. However, a multicenter, randomized trial showed that reverse hybrid therapy was superior to standard triple therapy (95.5% vs 88.6% ITT; P = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Hybrid therapy appears to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for H. pylori infection in the era of increasing antibiotic resistance. ? The Author(s) 2015.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of pharmacokinetic studies,2015,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,10.1093/jac/dkv080,,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to summarize antiretroviral drug concentrations in breast milk (BM) and exposure of breast-fed infants. Methods: This was a systematic review of pharmacokinetic studies of HIV-positive women taking antiretrovirals that measured drugs in BM. The quality of pharmacokinetic and laboratory methods was assessed using pre-defined criteria. Pooled ratios and 95% CIs were calculated using the generalized inverse variance method and heterogeneity was estimated by the I2 statistic. PubMed Central, SCOPUS and LactMed databases were searched. No date or language restrictions were applied. Searches were conducted up to 10 November 2014. Clinical relevance was estimated by comparing ingested dose with the recommended therapeutic dose for each drug. Results: Twenty-four studies were included. There was substantial variability in the clinical and laboratory methods used and in reported results. Relative to maternal plasma (MP), NRTIs accumulate in BM, with BM:MP ratios (95% CI estimates) from 0.89 to 1.21 (14 studies, 1159 paired BM and MP samples). NNRTI estimates were from 0.71 to 0.94 (17 studies, 965 paired samples) and PI estimates were from 0.17 to 0.21 (8 studies, 477 paired samples). Relative to the recommended paediatric doses, a breast-fed infant may ingest 8.4% (95% CI 1.9-15.0), 12.5% (95% CI 2.6-22.3) and 1.1% (95% CI 0-3.6) of lamivudine, nevirapine and efavirenz, respectively, via BM. Conclusions: Transfer to untreated infants appears quantitatively important for some NRTIs and NNRTIs.

Whether lumbar fusion is more effective than nonsurgical treatment of discogenic low back pain (DLBP) is controversial. Several randomized controlled trials that compared conservative treatment and fusion surgery had conflicting conclusions. OBJECTIVE: To compare between the effectiveness of lumbar fusion and nonsurgical intervention in patients with chronic low back pain caused by disc degeneration. METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, the Science Citation Index, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and references of relevant papers published from 1990 to 2013 were searched. Related data matching standards established for this research were extracted and statistically analyzed by using the RevMan (5.2) software. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials with a total of 889 patients revealed no difference in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score for DLBP between the fusion surgery and nonsurgical groups (mean difference, 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.02 to 2.14). Postsurgical complication rate significantly differed between the 2 groups (risk ratio, 22.11; 95% CI, 55.99-81.60). CONCLUSIONS: Fusion surgery was not superior to nonsurgical treatment in terms of changes in ODI scores for DLBP. Fusion surgery resulted in surgical complications. Longer follow-up observation is necessary regarding condition-specific disability, pain, and life satisfaction. ? 2015 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved."

A systematic search for the years 1989-2014 was conducted in the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases. Studies on hepatitis C in HCWs were included if they incorporated either a control group or reference data for the general population. The study quality was classified as high, moderate or low. Pooled effect estimates were calculated to determine the odds of occupational infection. Heterogeneity between studies was analysed using the ?2 test (p<0.10) and quantified using the I2 test. 57 studies met our criteria for inclusion and 44 were included in the meta-Analysis. Analysis of high and moderate quality studies showed a significantly increased OR for HCV infection in HCWs relative to control populations, with a value of 1.6 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.42). Stratification by study region gave an OR of 2.1 in low prevalence countries; while stratification by occupational groups gave an increased prevalence for medical (OR 2.2) and for laboratory staff (OR 2.2). The OR for professionals at high risk of blood contact was 2.7. The pooled analysis indicates that the prevalence of infection is significantly higher in HCWs than in the general population. The highest prevalence was observed among medical and laboratory staff. Prospective studies that focus on HCW-specific activity and personal risk factors for HCV infection are needed."

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the most virulent causative agent, and a monovalent vaccine against EV71 will soon become commercially available in China. An improved understanding of EV71 epidemiology would aid policy decisions regarding childhood immunization in China. We aimed to assess and summarize information to date from individual seroepidemiologic studies of EV71 in mainland China to determine patterns of the age-specific risk of infection. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of children aged 0-15 years, published in English or Chinese, was conducted. Estimates of seroprevalence were summarized by age group. A mixed-effects regression model was used to explore factors covarying with EV71 seroprevalence. Results: We identified 42 published studies, 15 in English. We found that an average of 78% of neonates was seropositive to EV71 infection, but such maternally conferred immunity almost completely waned by 5 months. The seroprevalence of EV71 antibody increased directly with age among preschool children, from 26% (95% confidence interval: 18%-33%) at 1 year to 70% (95% confidence interval: 62%-78%) at 5 years. Age of subjects, sample size, sampling year, sampling method, geographic latitude and publication language were associated with variations of individual seroprevalence estimates. Conclusions: Seroprevalence of EV71 antibody gradually declined during the first 5 months in infants. Infection of EV71 was most likely to occur between 2 and 4 years. Our findings may be useful in informing population-based EV71 vaccination strategies. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Studies reporting sensitivity and specificity data compared to a reference standard (reverse transcriptase PCR [RT-PCR], immunofluorescence, or viral culture) were considered. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study characteristics, diagnostic-accuracy estimates, and study quality. Accuracy estimates were pooled using bivariate random-effects regression models. Heterogeneity was investigated with prespecified subgroup analyses. Seventy-one articles met inclusion criteria. Overall, RSV RADT pooled sensitivity and specificity were 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76% to 83%) and 97% (95% CI, 96% to 98%), respectively. Positive- and negative- likelihood ratios were 25.5 (95% CI, 18.3 to 35.5) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.24), respectively. Sensitivity was higher in children (81% [95% CI, 78%, 84%]) than in adults (29% [95% CI, 11% to 48%]). Because of this disparity, further subgroup analyses were restricted to pediatric data (63 studies). Test sensitivity was poorest using RT-PCR as a reference standard and highest using immunofluorescence (74% versus 88%; P<0.001). Industry-sponsored studies reported significantly higher sensitivity (87% versus 78%; P=0.01). Our results suggest that the poor sensitivity of RSV RADTs in adults may preclude their use in this population.

Laparoscopy has been extensively applied to colorectal surgery providing significant benefits on short- and long-term outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis of the current evidence comparing the short-term outcomes of laparoscopic Hartmann¡¦s reversal (LHR) to open Hartmann¡¦s reversal (OHR). Methods: A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane database was performed. Comparative studies reporting short-term outcomes of LHR versus OHR with an intention-to-treat analysis were considered for eligibility. Primary outcome was 30-day morbidity. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, 30-day reoperations, length of hospital stay (LOS), operating time, and estimated blood loss. Results: Thirteen studies comparing 862 patients (403 LHR vs 459 OHR) were included. There was no difference in mortality, while LHR was associated with a reduced overall postoperative 30-day morbidity (OR, 0.24; 95?% CI, 0.16 to 0.34). Wound infections (OR, 0.54; 95?% CI, 0.35 to 0.85) and ileus (OR, 0.47; 95?% CI, 0.25 to 0.87) were more common after OHR. LOS was shorter in the laparoscopic group as it was the time to flatus. Meta-regression analysis showed that the results were independent from potential effect modifiers. Conclusions: LHR has less short-term complications than OHR in terms of overall morbidity, wound infection, and postoperative ileus. LOS is shorter in the LHR group, while no significant difference exists in the operating time. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings on unbiased populations. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Certain Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are well-established risk factors for carcinoma of the uterine cervix and for a subset of head and neck carcinomata: however their true importance in different populations and anatomical subsites remains unclear. The major risk factors in Asia Pacific remain smoked/smokeless tobacco, areca nut, alcohol abuse and poor diet, with limited evidence for HPVs. We review published studies of association of HPV with anatomical site-specific Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) in these populations and attempt a meta-analysis. Materials and methods: From MEDLINE/PubMed/WEB-of SCIENCE/EMBASE/Scopus databases we found 67 relevant studies with a total of 7280 cases: 15 case-control studies met our inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, totaling 1106 cases & 638 controls. HPV detection rates, sample site and size, and methods of tissue preservation and HPV detection were tabulated for each study. Results: Studies were heterogeneous in terms of sample selection and method of detection of HPVs. Most were of limited quality. Averaging data from 67 studies of HNSCC, the prevalence of HPV of any subtype is approximately 36%. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was the most used detection method and HPV16 the most common genotype reported. Meta-analyses of case-control studies from this region reveal significant heterogeneity but suggest higher HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal cancer (OR: 14.66; 95%CI: 6.09-35.26) compared to oral cavity cancer and laryngeal cancer; (OR: 4.06; 95%CI: 3.05-5.39 & OR: 3.23; 95%CI: 1.37-7.61) respectively. Conclusion: In view of the significant association of HPV with HNSCC, studies with accurate subsite classification and more sensitive detection methods are necessary. Accurate data from this geographical region are essential to inform public health policies and treatment decisions, especially as studies from Europe and North America reveal HPV-driven cancers to be less aggressive, permitting treatment de-intensification. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Whether patients may benefit from aerosolised colistin as adjunctive treatment was contradictory. We aimed to clarify the safety and efficacy of administering aerosolised and intravenous (IV-AS) colistin versus intravenous (IV) colistin alone in patients with NP caused by MDR-GNB. Two reviewers independently evaluated and extracted data from PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Primary outcomes were clinical response rate, all-cause mortality (ICU or hospital), microbiological eradication and nephrotoxicity. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated and significance was determined by the Z test. Nine eligible studies involving 672 participants were included. The overall clinical response rate (improvement and cure) was significantly higher in the IV-AS group than that in the IV group [OR = 1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-2.53; P = 0.0005]. Patients treated with IV-AS colistin showed a higher rate of pathogen eradication (OR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.11-2.49; P = 0.01) and lower all-cause mortality compared with IV colistin (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.50-0.95; P = 0.02). Nephrotoxicity did not differ significantly between IV-AS and IV groups (five studies; 383 patients) (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.69-1.80; P = 0.67).

Research has typically focussed on the prevalence, concentration, and transmission of zoonoses from farm animals to humans, yet there are gaps in our understanding of these factors among animals in contact with the public who don't live on or visit farms. This study aims to quantify, through a systematic review and meta-Analysis, the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter carriage in household pets and petting zoo animals. Four databases were accessed for the systematic review (PubMed, CAB direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science) for papers published in English from 1992-2012, and studies were included if they examined the animal population of interest, assessed prevalence or concentration with fecal, hair coat, oral, or urine exposure routes (although only articles that examined fecal routes were found), and if the research was based in Canada, USA, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Studies were reviewed for qualitative synthesis and meta-Analysis by two reviewers, compiled into a database, and relevant studies were used to create a weighted mean prevalence value. There were insufficient data to run a meta-Analysis of concentration values, a noted study limitation. The mean prevalence of Campylobacter in petting zoo animals is 6.5% based on 7 studies, and in household pets the mean is 24.7% based on 34 studies. Our estimated concentration values were: 7.65x103cfu/g for petting zoo animals, and 2.9x105cfu/g for household pets. These results indicate that Campylobacter prevalence and concentration are lower in petting zoo animals compared with household pets and that both of these animal sources have a lower prevalence compared with farm animals that do not come into contact with the public. There is a lack of studies on Campylobacter in petting zoos and/or fair animals in Canada and abroad. Within this literature, knowledge gaps were identified, and include: A lack of concentration data reported in the literature for Campylobacter spp. in animal feces, a distinction between ill and diarrheic pets in the reported studies, noted differences in shedding and concentrations for various subtypes of Campylobacter, and consistent reporting between studies. ? 2015 Pintar et al.

The goal of this meta-analysis was to determine if ND indeed reduced the risk of infection and death in cancer patients compared to regular diets (RD). We identified studies in cancer patients that compared the effect of ND vs. RD on the risk of infections and mortality of any cause. The overall effect was calculated by use of a random effects model. Four studies were identified encompassing 918 patients. There was no difference in major infection or mortality rates between ND and RD groups. When analyzing for the overall composite outcome of any infection or fever, the hazard ratio was significantly higher in the ND arm (relative risk = 1.18, confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.34, P= 0.007). When the analysis was restricted to only the randomized trials, both groups had a comparable composite outcome. This meta-analysis shows no superiority with respect to mortality or infection of using a neutropenic diet in cancer patients. Larger studies are needed that study a broader range of nutritional issues, including the microbiome, in this patient population. Until then, it may be time to relax the restrictions of ND.

Last search was on March 19, 2015. Extracted data from individual studies were summarized and summary proportions of eyes healed and complications for different subgroups were estimated. Results: Twenty-five studies were included (2 randomized controlled trials, 13 case series, and 10 case reports) with a total of 210 eyes of 209 patients, of which 175 eyes underwent CXL. Causative microorganisms were bacteria, fungi, acanthamoeba, and Herpes simplex virus in 96, 32, 11, and 2 cases, respectively. Coinfections were present in 13 and cause was inconclusive in 21 cases. Sixteen of 175 eyes received no additional antibiotics, whereas 159 underwent CXL as an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment. Proportion of eyes healed with CXL was 87.2% (95% confidence interval (CI), 81.9%, 91.8%). For bacterial keratitis, the proportion of eyes healed was 85.7% (95% CI, 78.5%, 91.7%), whereas 10/11 and 25/32 eyes with acanthamoeba and fungal keratitis, respectively, were healed (available data not sufficient to provide a valid proportion analysis). Treatment resulted in corneal melting and tectonic keratoplasty in both Herpes simplex virus cases. Conclusions: CXL seems promising in the management of infectious keratitis, excluding viral infections. However, more randomized controlled trials are required to assess its efficacy.

The rate of refracture, malunion, infectious recurrence, knee stiffness, amputation, limb edema and peroneal nerve palsy was respectively 4%, 7%, 5%, 12%, 4%, 13% and 13%. Conclusions: Our systematic review showed that the patients with infected nonunion of tibia and femur treated by Ilizarov methods had a low rate of poor bone and functional results. Therefore, Ilizarov methods may be a good choice for the treatment of infected nonunion of tibia and femur. ? 2015 Yin et al.

The effect of antibiotic and antiseptic prophylaxis on outcomes for this type of surgery has not been adequately reviewed. A systematic search of the main databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating antibiotics and antiseptics was conducted to evaluate the predetermined endpoints of infection, adverse events, costs, quality of life, and concentration levels of antibiotics. A meta-analysis using pooled effect estimates and fixed-effect and random-effect models of risk ratios (RR), calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI), was utilized. Thirty (30) RCTs examined the effects of antibiotic and antiseptic prophylaxis on infections after primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) (total of 11,597 participants) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (total of 6,141 participants). For THA, preoperative systemic intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic prophylaxis may be effective in reducing the incidence of infection after THA from 6 months to ?5 years. For TKA, there is no RCT evidence that antibiotics and/or antiseptics have any effect on infection rate. Preoperative systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in primary THA may be effective at reducing infection rate. There is no evidence that timing, route of administration, or concentration levels have an effect on reducing infections, adverse events, or costs in THA or TKA. Many of the trials included in this study were published in the 1980s and 1990s. Thus, it would be important to replicate a number of them based on current patient demographics and incidence of bacterial resistance. Copyright ? 2015 Voigt et al."

The reason of steroid resistance is still unclear, but cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection may be a potential cause in some IBD patients. We carried out a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between CMV infection and steroid-resistant IBD. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to June 2014, with no language restrictions, for observational studies. Additional references were obtained from reviewed articles. Results: Eleven studies involving 867 IBD patients were included in the meta-analysis. Steroid resistance rate was 70.0?% in CMV-positive IBD patients, which was significantly higher than that in CMV-negative IBD patients (RR?=?2.12, 95?% CI?=?1.72¡V2.61). There was significant heterogeneity in the included eleven studies (I2?=?57.6?%).

The analysis was also broadened to examine any differences in acquisition risk between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. A search using Medline/PubMed, Cochrane and CINHAL yielded 2577 citations between 1984 and 2014. Reviews were assessed in accordance with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). Just seven articles met the inclusion criteria, namely: (a) papers were peer reviewed, (b) pathogen acquisition prevalence rates were reported, (c) articles were written in English; and (d) had minimal or no risk of bias based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). One study was an extension of a previous study and was discarded. Employing NOS provided little difference between the studies, with five studies receiving eight-star and two studies receiving seven-star ratings, respectively. Overall, pooled acquisition odds ratio for study pathogens (meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; vancomycin-resistant enterococcus; Clostridium difficile; acinetobacter; extended-spectrum £]-lactamase-producing coliforms; pseudomonas) was 2.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.65-2.77]. When comparing data between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, the pooled acquisition odds ratio for Gram-negatives was 2.65 (95% CI: 2.02-3.47) and 1.89 (95% CI: 1.62-2.21) for Gram positives. The findings have important implications for infection control professionals, environmental cleaning services and patients, since current practices fail to adequately reduce acquisition risk. Although there may be non-preventable sources of acquisition, revised practices require collaborative work between all responsible staff in order to reduce this risk to a minimum. ? 2015 The Healthcare Infection Society."

Studies that met our minimum requirements were evaluated using inclusion and exclusion criteria and the Oxford Quality Scale. Those with a score of 3 or more on this Scale were included and their data were extracted and analysed. For evaluation of the risk of infection the absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, and 95% CI were calculated. For evaluation of the risk of an adverse effect the absolute risk increase, number needed to harm, and 95% CI were calculated using the Risk Reduction Calculator. Each meta-analysis was made with the help of the Mantel-Haenszel random effects model, and estimates of risk (OR) and 95% CI were calculated using the Review Manager 5.3, from the Cochrane Library. A significant risk was assumed when the lower limit of the 95% CI was greater than 1. Probabilities of less than 0.05 were accepted as significant. The results showed that there was no reduction in the risk of infection when amoxicillin was given before or after operation compared with an untreated group or placebo.

Body piercing represents a progressively popular sociocultural phenomenon which is also a potential exposure approach for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Conclusions from those researches with statistically risk assessment of body piercing on HBV and HCV transmission are contradictory. Systematically analyze the association between body piercing and the risk of transmitting hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus for general population. Make evidence-based recommendations to the current practice and wake up public awareness of this health-threatening behavior. Comprehensive and high sensitivity search strategies were performed to exhaustively search related studies before 15 January 2015 (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WANFANG, CNKI datasets for published literatures, and Google and Google scholars for related grey articles). Two authors identified relevant studies for the review, abstracted data, and assessed literature quality independently and critically according to the selection criteria and quality assessment standard. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to estimate risk of HBV and HCV infection in relation to body piercing status. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the source of heterogeneity and test the robust of the results. A total of 40 studies were included in this systematic review (10 for Hep-B, 26 for Hep-C, 4 for both Hep-B and Hep-C), the pooled OR (95% CI) for the association between body piercing and transmission of HBV/HCV is 1.80 (1.18, 2.75) and 1.83 (1.27, 2.64), respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that highest risk of body piercing related to hepatitis C infection was for former soccer and veterans with OR of 4.63 (2.65, 8.10), while strongest association between body piercing and hepatitis B was for samples derived from students/community with OR of 2.40 (1.44, 4.02). The current systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that body piercing is significantly associated with the transmission of HBV as well as HCV, having body piercing probably can increase the risk of getting infected. Evidence from this study strongly recommends that comprehensive and effective programs should be established to provide safer piercing practice. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

As no published study reported mortality in standard BMI groups (&lt;18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25-29.9, ?30kg/m2), the most adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) according to a pre-defined list of covariates were obtained from authors and pooled by random-effect model across each BMI category.

Methods: Two review authors independently searched for the relevant randomized controlled clinical trials from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, IndMed, LILACS, and clinical trials registry www.clinicaltrials.gov. Primary outcomes for this review included: change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and risk of occurrence of genital mycotic infections at 26 weeks. We combined results using mean difference (MD) for continuous data, and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data. Results: Of the 124 identified reports, five RCTs with 3565 participants were eligible for the meta-analysis. All included studies had compared canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg once daily with placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. We judged that most of the studies had low risk of bias or unclear risk of bias in five major domains. Canagliflozin 300 mg once daily led to a significant decrease in HbA1c levels (IV Fixed-0.77, 95% CI [-0.90,-0.64] P < 0.00001) and FPG levels (IV Fixed-2.08; 95% CI [-2.32,-1.84], P <0.00001), body weight, systolic blood pressure and triglyceride levels after 26 weeks as compared to placebo. There was a also a significant difference in the efficacy of canagliflozin 300 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg once daily in favour of canagliflozin. Both doses of canagliflozin led to genital mycotic infections among males and females, urinary tract infections, pollakiuria, polyuria and postural dizziness. Conclusions: Canagliflozin significantly decreases HbA1c and FPG levels and body weight as compared to placebo among patients with inadequate glycemic control with an earlier regime of glucose lowering agents.

A common approach involves temporary treatment of hydrocephalus in these patients with a ventriculosubgaleal shunt (VSGS), ventricular access device (VAD), or external ventricular drain (EVD) until it becomes evident that the patient needs and can tolerate permanent CSF diversion (i.e., ventriculoperitoneal shunt). The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a robust and comprehensive summary of the published literature regarding the clinical outcomes and complications of these 3 techniques as temporizing measures in the management of prematurity-related PHVD/PHH. Methods The authors searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library for studies published through December 2013 on the use of VSGSs, VADs, and/or EVDs as temporizing devices for the treatment of hydrocephalus following IVH in the premature neonate. Data pertaining to patient demographic data, study methods, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from eligible articles. For each of the 3 types of temporizing device, the authors performed meta-analyses examining 6 outcomes of interest, which were rates of 1) obstruction; 2) infection; 3) arrest of hydrocephalus (i.e., permanent shunt independence); 4) mortality; 5) good neurodevelopmental outcome; and 6) revision. Results Thirty-nine studies, representing 1502 patients, met eligibility criteria. All of the included articles were observational studies; 36 were retrospective and 3 were prospective designs. Nine studies (n = 295) examined VSGSs, 24 (n = 962) VADs, and 9 (n = 245) EVDs. Pooled rates of outcome for VSGS, VAD, and EVD, respectively, were 9.6%, 7.3%, and 6.8% for obstruction; 9.2%, 9.5%, and 6.7% for infection; 12.2%, 10.8%, and 47.3% for revision; 13.9%, 17.5%, and 31.8% for arrest of hydrocephalus; 12.1%, 15.3%, and 19.1% for death; and 58.7%, 50.1%, and 56.1% for good neurodevelopmental outcome.

Paratuberculosis. The latter has been debated for a century due to pathogenic and clinical similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease (108 studies) in humans and recently for involvement in other human diseases; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (2), sarcoidosis (3), diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) (7) and type 2 (3), multiple sclerosis (5) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (2). Meta-analytical results indicated a significant positive association, consistently across different laboratory methods for Crohn's disease [odds ratio (OR) range 4¡P26-8¡P44], T1DM (OR range 2¡P91-9¡P95) and multiple sclerosis (OR range 6¡P5-7¡P99). The latter two and the thyroiditis hypothesis require further investigation to confirm the association. Meta-regression of Crohn's disease studies using DNA detection methods indicated that choice of primers and sampling frame (e.g. general population vs. hospital-based sample) explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity. Other epidemiological studies demonstrated a lack of association between high-risk occupations and development of Crohn's disease. Due to knowledge gaps in understanding the role of M.

Methods: Records of HCV incidence and prevalence were reviewed systematically and synthesized following PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analyses were implemented using a DerSimonian-Laird random effects model with inverse variance weighting to estimate HCV prevalence among various at risk populations. A risk of bias assessment was incorporated. Results: The search identified one HCV incidence and 76 HCV prevalence measures. HCV incidence was only assessed among people who inject drugs (PWID), and was reported at 66.7 per 100 person-years. Meta-analyses estimated HCV prevalence at 0.7% among the general population (range 0-9.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.5-0.9%), 32.6% among PWID (range 9.5-70.0%, 95% CI 24.5-41.3%), and 2.3% among populations at intermediate risk (range 0.0-8.3%, 95% CI 1.3-3.7%). No data were available for other high risk populations such as hemodialysis, thalassemia, and hemophilia patients. Conclusions: HCV prevalence among the general population in Afghanistan is comparable to global levels. Data are needed for the level of infection among key clinical populations at high risk of infection.

Recently, international targets have emphasized the importance of long-term virological suppression as a key measure of program performance. Methods.We systematically reviewed publications and conference abstracts published between January 2006 and May 2013 that reported virological outcomes among human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected adults receiving first-line ART for up to 5 years in LMICs. Summary estimates of virological suppression after 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months of ART were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis assumed all participants who were lost to follow-up, died, or stopped ART as having virological failure. Results.Summary estimates of virological suppression remained >80% for up to 60 months of ART for all 184 included cohorts.

There are no formal guidelines, and this may be due to a lack of formal summary of the data. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in April 2014 including all randomised control trials on prophylactic antibiotic use for FC. The main outcome measures were confirmed bacteriuria on mid-stream urine (MSU), asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic bacteriuria. A meta-analysis was conducted with difference between groups expressed as an odds ratio (OR) and control group risk. Results: 5,107 patients were included, 2,173 in placebo and 2,934 in the antibiotic group. The OR for all three outcomes favoured the antibiotic group; the risk of developing symptomatic bacteriuria was 0.06 times more likely in the control group (OR 0.34), 0.054 (OR 0.40) for developing asymptomatic bacteriuria and 0.109 for confirming bacteriuria on MSU (OR 0.36).

Conclusions: Antibiotic prophylaxis did confer a reduction in cases of symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria but the NNT were high. Therefore, the authors cannot advocate the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for routine FC procedures. ? 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE between inception and January 2014, including all studies reporting seasonal incidence of GBS. We included a retrospective cohort study of patients with GBS at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford 2001-2012 and determined the seasonal variation in GBS incidence and length of stay. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) for winter versus summer was pooled across studies by fixed and random effects meta-analysis weighted by inverse variance, stratified by geographical region, infectious prodrome and GBS subtype. Results: Across 9836 patients from 42 studies there was a 14% increased risk of GBS in winter versus summer (IRR=1.14, 1.02-1.27, p=0.020), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I2=77%, p&lt;0.0001), including significant seasonal variation in Oxford (n=140; p=0.037) for winter versus summer (IRR=1.92, 1.18-3.11, p=0.004) but a non-significantly reduced length of stay for winter versus other seasons (15 vs 21 days, p=0.08). Across all studies, there was greater seasonal variation with respiratory prodrome (IRR=3.06, 1.84-5.11, p&lt;0.0001) than diarrhoeal prodrome (IRR=1.10, 0.60-2.00, p=0.76) and a greater incidence in winter in Western countries (IRR=1.28), the Far East (IRR=1.20) and Middle East (IRR=1.12), with a lower incidence in the Indian subcontinent (IRR=0.86) and Latin America (IRR=0.75). Discussion: Incidence of GBS was greater in winter than summer, but this was not evident in all geographical regions. This is likely to be related to regional variation in prodromal illnesses. ? 2015, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

To our knowledge, no systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the overall safety profile of CZP has been performed. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the adverse event (AE) patterns of CZP versus a control in patients with IMIDs. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the FDA database for clinical trials up to March 2014. Eligible studies were those that compared the safety profile of CZP to a control group in patients with IMIDs. The following data were extracted: number of patients experiencing AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), adverse drug reactions (ADRs), withdrawals due to AEs, fatal AEs, infectious AEs and SAEs, upper respiratory tract infections, injection-site reactions, neoplasms, and tuberculosis. Results: A total of 2023 references were identified and 18 randomized controlled trials were included. The main pooled risk ratios of CZP-treated versus control patients were as follows: AEs 1.09 (95?% confidence interval, CI 1.04¡V1.14), SAEs 1.50 (95?% CI 1.21¡V1.86), ADRs 1.20 (95?% CI 1.03¡V1.39), infectious AEs 1.28 (95?% CI 1.13¡V1.45), infectious SAEs 2.17 (95?% CI 1.36¡V3.47), and upper respiratory tract infections 1.34 (95?% CI 1.15¡V1.57). Conclusion: Safety data on CZP suggest an overall favorable tolerability profile, with infections being the most common AE. However, CZP-treated patients had a twofold higher risk of infectious SAEs than control patients. Large observational studies and data from national registries are needed to detect rare AEs, which might occur after long-term exposures to CZP. ? 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland."

Methods: A literature search was performed from inception to February 2015. Studies that reported relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios comparing the risks of C. difficile-associated diarrhea in patients with CKD or ESRD versus those without CKD or ESRD were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95?% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Twenty studies (nine case¡Vcontrol, seven cohort, and four cross-sectional studies with 162,218,041 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled RRs of C. difficile-associated diarrhea in patients with CKD and ESRD were 1.95 (95?% CI 1.81¡V2.10) and 2.63 (95?% CI 2.04¡V3.38), respectively. When meta-analysis was limited only to cohort and case¡Vcontrol studies with confounder-adjusted analysis, the pooled RRs of C. difficile-associated diarrhea in patients with CKD and ESRD were 1.89 (95?% CI 1.75¡V2.05) and 2.50 (95?% CI 1.49¡V4.17), respectively. The pooled RR of recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhea in patients with CKD was 2.61 (95?% CI 1.53¡V4.44). Data on the risk of recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhea were limited. Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrates significantly increased risks of incident and recurrent C. difficile-associated diarrhea in patients with CKD.

Here, we present a meta- and systematic analysis of adult studies published between 1994 and 2015 with the aim of updating existing quantitative reviews and providing a comprehensive cover of the six most commonly studied outcomes¡Xmortality, infection, renal dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), thrombotic complications and prolonged hospital length of stay. Methods: Computerised searches of Pubmed and EMBASE identified publications that reported target outcomes and PRBC storage duration prior to transfusion. Bibliographies of relevant literature were manually searched to incorporate missed studies. Randomised controlled trial (RCT) data was meta-analysed using a random effects model with Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.1 software. Observational investigations were systematically reviewed. Results: Sixty-four papers were selected covering 462,581 patients with the majority of studies being observational in nature. Meta-analysis of eight RCTs demonstrated a trend towards decreased mortality with stored PRBC transfusion; albeit this effect was not statistically significant (OR 0.91, 95?% CI 0.78¡V1.05, p?=?0.20). In a small subset of intensive care unit (ICU), cardiac surgery and trauma patients; observational studies suggested that prolonged storage may be correlated with increased mortality. Trauma and cardiac surgery patients appeared to be most susceptible to the potential infectious complications of stored PRBCs. Stored PRBCs were unlikely to affect thrombotic complications or hospital length of stay. There were inadequate data to determine whether stored PRBCs had clinically relevant effects on renal dysfunction and MODS. Conclusion: Although literature presents a concerning picture of potential storage complications, current findings are too inconsistent to drive changes in clinical practice. Results from current RCTs will likely play a role in PRBC age guidelines for cardiac surgery and ICU patients. However, these studies may be less efficacious at detecting small effects that are limited to specific subpopulations. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM."

Methods: Chinese and English peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and February 2013 were systematically searched. Standard meta-analysis methods were used to calculate the pooled HIV prevalence, in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Results: The national HIV prevalence among FSWs declined from 0.74% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.37-1.49%) in 2000-2002 to 0.40% (95% CI 0.31-0.53%) in 2009-2011.

In this paper we synthesize existing data on the natural history of HCV among PWID, including fibrosis progression rates (FPR) and the incidence of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We conducted electronic and manual searches for published and unpublished literature. Reports were eligible if they (i) included participants who were chronically infected with HCV and reported current or previous injection drug use; (ii) presented original data on disease progression in a study sample comprised of at least 90% PWID; (iii) published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2013; and (iv) included data from upper-middle- or high-income countries. Quality ratings were assigned using an adaptation of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We estimated pooled FPRs using the stage-constant and stage-specific methods, and pooled incidence rates of CC, DC, and HCC. Results: Twenty-one reports met the study inclusion criteria. Based on random-effect models, the pooled stage-constant FPR was 0.117 METAVIR units per year (95% CI, 0.099-0.135), and the stage-specific FPRs were F0. ¡÷. F1, 0.128 (95% CI 0.080, 0.176); F1. ¡÷. F2, 0.059 (95% CI 0.035, 0.082); F2. ¡÷. F3, 0.078 (95% CI 0.056, 0.100); and F3. ¡÷. F4, 0.116 (95% CI 0.070, 0.161). The pooled incidence rates of CC, DC, and HCC were 6.6 (95% CI 4.8, 8.4), 1.1 (95% CI 0.8, 1.4), and 0.3 (95% CI -0.1, 0.6) events per 1000 person-years, respectively. Following the stage-constant estimate, average time to cirrhosis is 34 years post-infection, and time to METAVIR stage F3 is 26 years; using the stage-specific estimates, time to cirrhosis is 46 years and time to F3 is 38 years. Conclusion: Left untreated, PWID with chronic HCV infection will develop liver sequelae (including HCC) in mid- to late-adulthood. Delaying treatment with the new drug regimens until advanced fibrosis develops prolongs the period of infectiousness to perhaps thirty years. Scaling up of effective HCV prevention and early engagement in care and treatment will facilitate the elimination HCV as a source of serious disease in PWID. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V."

We conducted a meta-Analysis of published literature to compare patient adherence, clinical, and cost outcomes of STR to MTR. Published literature in English between 2005 and 2014 was searched using Embase, PubMed (Medline in-process), and ClinicalTrials.Gov databases. Two-level screening was undertaken by 2 independent researchers to finalize articles for evidence synthesis. Adherence, efficacy, safety, tolerability, healthcare resource use (HRU), and costs were assessed comparing STR to MTR. A random-effects meta-Analysis was performed and heterogeneity examined using meta-regression. Thirty-five articles were identified for qualitative evidence synthesis, of which 9 had quantifiable data for meta-Analysis (4 randomized controlled trials and 5 observational studies). Patients on STR were significantly more adherent when compared to patients on MTR of any frequency (odds ratio [OR]: 2.37 [95% CI: 1.68, 3.35], P<0.001; 4 studies), twice-daily MTR (OR: 2.53 [95% CI: 1.13, 5.66], P0.02; 2 studies), and once-daily MTR (OR: 1.81 [95% CI: 1.15, 2.84], P0.01; 2 studies). The relative risk (RR) for viral load suppression at 48 weeks was higher (RR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.15], P.0003; 3 studies) while RR of grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities was lower among patients on STR (RR: 0.68 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.94], P0.02; 2 studies). Changes in CD4 count at 48 weeks, any severe adverse events (SAEs), grade 3 to 4 AEs, mortality, and tolerability were found comparable between STR and MTR. Several studies reported significant reduction in HRU and costs among STR group versus MTR. Study depicted comparable tolerability, safety (All-SAE and Grade 34 AE), and mortality and fewer Grade 3 to 4 lab abnormalities and better viral load suppression and adherence among patients on FDCcontaining STR versus MTR; literature depicted favorable HRU and costs for STRs.

Moreover, S. boulardii reduced the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea; however, this reduction was significant only in children (2 randomised controlled trials, n = 579, RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08-0.73) and not in adults (9 randomised controlled trials, n = 1441, RR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.47-1.34). Conclusions This meta-analysis confirms that S. boulardii is effective in reducing the risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in children and adults. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

This review compared two of the main treatment alternatives: quinolone or macrolide monotherapy versus their combination with £]-lactams. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including adult inpatients and outpatients with CAP that compared treatment with any respiratory fluoroquinolone or macrolide administered as single agent with combination therapy of a £]-lactam plus either a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide (four separate comparisons) were conducted. The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical and microbiological failure, treatment discontinuation and adverse events. A comprehensive search was conducted with no date, language or publication status restrictions. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals are reported. Sixteen RCTs randomising 4809 patients were included. All but one included hospitalised patients. Mortality was low, and no differences between groups were observed in all comparisons. Quinolone monotherapy resulted in significantly less clinical failures [RR = 0.72 (0.57-0.91)], treatment discontinuations [RR = 0.65 (0.54-0.78)] and diarrhoea [RR = 0.13 (0.05-0.34)] compared with £]-lactam/macrolide combinations (nine trials). Addition of a £]-lactam to quinolones did not improve outcomes (three trials). In all comparisons, treatment discontinuation and diarrhoea were more frequent in patients receiving combination therapy with a £]-lactam. Overall, there is no evidence for a benefit of £]-lactam/macrolide or £]-lactam/quinolone combination therapies over monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone. The ecological implications of selecting fluoroquinolone or £]-lactam monotherapy as the preferred regimen for hospitalised CAP among adults should be further investigated. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

The two-stage revision strategy has been claimed as being the ""gold standard"" for treating prosthetic joint infection. The one-stage revision strategy remains an attractive alternative option; however, its effectiveness in comparison to the two-stage strategy remains uncertain. Objective. To compare the effectiveness of one- and two-stage revision strategies in treating prosthetic hip infection, using re-infection as an outcome. Design. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, manual search of bibliographies to March 2015, and email contact with investigators. Study Selection. Cohort studies (prospective or retrospective) conducted in generally unselected patients with prosthetic hip infection treated exclusively by one- or two-stage revision and with reinfection outcomes reported within two years of revision. No clinical trials were identified. Review Methods. Data were extracted by two independent investigators and a consensus was reached with involvement of a third. Rates of re-infection from 38 one-stage studies (2,536 participants) and 60 two-stage studies (3,288 participants) were aggregated using random-effect models after arcsine transformation, and were grouped by study and population level characteristics. Results. In one-stage studies, the rate (95% confidence intervals) of re-infection was 8.2% (6.0-10.8). The corresponding re-infection rate after two-stage revision was 7.9% (6.2-9.7). Reinfection rates remained generally similar when grouped by several study and population level characteristics. There was no strong evidence of publication bias among contributing studies. Conclusion. Evidence from aggregate published data suggest similar re-infection rates after one- or twostage revision among unselected patients. More detailed analyses under a broader range of circumstances and exploration of other sources of heterogeneity will require collaborative pooling of individual participant data. ? 2015 Kunutsor et al.

Studies looking at acquired drug resistance (ADR) are diverse with respect to geographical distribution, HIV co-infection rates, retreatment status and programmatic factors such as regimens administered and directly observed therapy. Our objective was to examine and consolidate evidence from clinical studies of the multifactorial aetiology of acquired rifamycin and/or isoniazid resistance within the scope of a single systematic review. This is important to inform policy and identify key areas for further studies. Methods. Case-control and cohort studies and randomised controlled trials that reported ADR as an outcome during antitubercular treatment regimens including a rifamycin and examined the association of at least 1 risk factor were included. Post hoc, we carried out random effects Mantel-Haenszel weighted meta-analyses of the impact of 2 key risk factors 1) HIV and 2) baseline drug resistance on the binary outcome of ADR. Heterogeneity was assessed used I2 statistic. As a secondary outcome, we calculated median cumulative incidence of ADR, weighted by the sample size of the studies. Results. Meta-analysis of 15 studies showed increased risk of ADR with baseline mono- or polyresistance (RR 4.85 95% CI 3.26 to 7.23, heterogeneity I2 58%, 95% CI 26 to 76%). Meta-analysis of 8 studies showed that HIV co-infection was associated with increased risk of ADR (RR 3.02, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.11); there was considerable heterogeneity amongst these studies (I2 81%, 95% CI 64 to 90%). Non-adherence, extrapulmonary/disseminated disease and advanced immunosuppression in HIV co-infection were other risk factors noted. The weighted median cumulative incidence of acquired multi drug resistance calculated in 24 studies (assuming whole cohort as denominator, regardless of follow up DST) was 0.1% (5th to 95th percentile 0.07 to 3.2%). Conclusion. Baseline drug resistance and HIV co-infection were significant risk factors for ADR. There was a trend of positive association with non-adherence which is likely to contribute to the outcome of ADR. The multifactorial aetiology of ADR in a programmatic setting should be further evaluated via appropriately designed studies. ? 2015 Rockwood et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited."

However, it is unclear whether the risk of urinary tract injury increases with previous CS during LH. Methods: PubMed and Embase databases were searched for all studies on previous history of CS and risk of urinary tract injuries during and after LH. Reference lists of the identified studies, reviews, and other relevant publications were also searched. Urinary tract injuries or related complications were the outcomes of interest. Meta-analysis was conducted using an inverse-variance weighted random-effects model. Results: A total of 7 studies including 3,191 patients were identified in the meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95?% confidence interval (CI) of urinary tract injury were 3.48 (1.86¡V6.50) for previous CS compared with no previous CS. However, only two studies reported sufficient data on ureteral injury, and the combined RR was 1.83 (95?% CI 0.19¡V17.26). All seven studies reported the outcomes of bladder injury, and the pooled RR was 3.75 (95?% CI 1.96¡V7.17). Stratified analyses showed a basically consistent result with the overall analysis except for that by 1¡V2 times of previous CS (RR 2.32, 95?% CI 0.56¡V9.56). Conclusions: Previous CS is significantly associated with development of bladder injury during LH. No significant association was found yet between previous CS and risk of ureteral injury. Given the limited number of studies, more future studies are required to confirm the associations. ? 2015, The International Urogynecological Association."

A Meta-analysis,2015,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,10.1007/s11999-015-4347-1,25981715,"Background: Distal radius fractures are common, costly, and increasing in incidence. Percutaneous K-wire fixation and volar locking plates are two of the most commonly used surgical treatments for unstable dorsally displaced distal radius fractures. However, there is uncertainty regarding which of these treatments is superior. Questions/purposes: We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to determine whether patients treated with volar locking plates (1) achieved better function (2) attained better wrist motion, (3) had better radiographic outcomes, and (4) had fewer complications develop than did patients treated with K-wires for dorsally displaced distal radius fractures. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (inception to 2014, October Week 2), EMBASE (inception to 2014, Week 42), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant randomized controlled trials; we supplemented these searches with manual searches. We included studies of extraarticular and intraarticular distal radius fractures. Adjunctive external fixation was acceptable as long as the intent was to use only K-wires where possible and external fixation was used in less than 25% of the procedures. We considered a difference in the DASH scores of 10 as the minimal clinically important difference. We performed quality assessment with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and evaluated the strength of recommendations using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Seven randomized trials with a total of 875 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Results: Patients treated with volar locking plates had slightly better function than did patients treated with K-wires as measured by their DASH scores at 3?months (mean difference [MD], 7.5; 95% CI, 4.4¡V10.6; p?<?0.001) and 12?months (MD, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2¡V6.3; p?=?0.004). Neither of these differences exceeded the a priori-determined threshold for clinical importance (10 points). There was a small early advantage in flexion and supination in the volar locking plate group (3.7¢X [95% CI, 0.3¢X¡V7.1¢X; p?=?0.04] and 4.1¢X [95% CI, 0.6¢X¡V7.6¢X; p?=?0.02] greater, respectively) at 3?months, but not at later followups (6 or 12?months). There were no differences in radiographic outcomes (volar tilt, radial inclination, and radial height) between the two interventions. Superficial wound infection was more common in patients treated with K-wires (8.2% versus 3.2%; RR?=?2.6; p?=?0.001), but otherwise no difference in complication rates was found. Conclusions: Despite the small number of studies and the limitations inherent in a meta-analysis, we found that volar locking plates show better DASH scores at 3- and 12-month followups compared with K-wires for displaced distal radius fractures in adults; however, these differences were small and unlikely to be clinically important. Further research is required to better delineate if there are specific radiographic, injury, or patient characteristics that may benefit from volar locking plates in the short term and whether there are any differences in long-term outcomes and complications.

Subsequent loss of joint function can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. Corticosteroids are known to have beneficial effects on the rate and extent cartilage destruction in arthritis through a variety of mediators such as synovial RANKL expression, mast cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Investigation into sepsis at other sites has suggested improved outcomes with corticosteroid use despite the theoretical risks. This study therefore set out to review current literature with regards to a possible beneficial effect for corticosteroids in Septic Arthritis. Methods: A computerised search of the databases MEDLINE and CINAHL was conducted during November 2014 using the EBSCOhost web search engine in order to identify research articles relating to the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of septic arthritis. The search strategy revealed 223 unique articles which were subjected to inclusion/exclusion criteria assessment. 6 articles were selected for study inclusion. These consisted of 3 human studies (2 double-blind randomised controlled trials & 1 double-blind non-randomised controlled trial), and 3 animal studies (3 non-blinded non-randomised controlled trials). Quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) was only possible regarding two primary outcomes for two of the included studies - time to normalisation of CRP and duration of IV antibiotic therapy. Results: All current published evidence in humans is focused upon children. Overall results did however reveal a consensus between these studies for a reduced duration of symptoms and a reduction in inflammatory markers. Animal data suggested a protective effect on the articular cartilage with the addition of corticosteroids to antibiotic therapy. No article noted an adverse effect associated with steroid use. Findings were consistent with systematic reviews of corticosteroid use in other bacterial infections. Conclusions: Despite the promising outlook, issues' regarding generalisability of results and a lack of large randomised controlled trial data necessitates further assessment of the safety and efficacy of steroid use in adults before treatment recommendations can be made. Long term safety data and the determinations of the optimum route, dose and timing of corticosteroids are also required. ? 2015 Farrow."

Both HIV-diagnosed (HIV-D) and HIV-nondiagnosed (HIV-N) MSM report a variety of reasons for intentional and unintentional nonuse of condoms. Elucidating and comparing reasons for continued engagement in condomless anal sex specific to both HIV-D and HIV-N MSM likely is important to identifying effective prevention. Methods: This study employed meta-analytic methods to evaluate and compare correlates to condomless anal sex in both HIV-D and HIV-N MSM from primary studies from 1993 to February 2013. Results: Of the 19 individual correlates assessed within the subgroup of HIV-D MSM, variables that achieved significant effect were alcohol, mind-altering substance use, sexual-enhancement medication, intentional condom nonuse, self-efficacy, attitudes toward condom use, social support, gay identity, compulsivity, trading sex, and number of sex partners. Those that were statistically non-significant were intention to use a condom, perceived risk, perceived norms, perceived responsibility, HIV medical management, treatment optimism, mental health, and setting. Of the 12 correlates assessed within the subgroup of HIV-N MSM, variables that achieved significant effect were alcohol, mind-altering substance use, intentional condom nonuse, attitudes toward condom use, perceived risk, and setting. Those observed as statistically non-significant were perceived norms, social support, gay identity, mental health, trading sex, and number of sex partners. Conclusion: Study results have clinical implications that may guide future prevention research and practice by highlighting risk variables shared between HIV-N and HIV-D MSM, as well as variables observed to be unique to each group that may warrant more tailored intervention.

The results of the present meta-analysis (13 studies, 4155 COPD patients, NAC n=1933; placebo or controls n=2222) showed that patients treated with NAC had significantly and consistently fewer exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD (relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.84; p<0.01), although this protective effect was more apparent in patients without evidence of airway obstruction. However, high doses of NAC were also effective in patients suffering from COPD diagnosed using spirometric criteria (relative risk 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.82; p=0.04). NAC was well tolerated and the risk of adverse reactions was not dose-dependent (low doses relative risk 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97; p=0.40; high doses relative risk 1.11, 95% CI 0.89-1.39; p=0.58). The strong signal that comes from this meta-analysis leads us to state that if a patient suffering from chronic bronchitis presents a documented airway obstruction, NAC should be administered at a dose of ?1200 mg per day to prevent exacerbations, while if a patient suffers from chronic bronchitis, but is without airway obstruction, a regular treatment of 600 mg per day seems to be sufficient. ?

All trials were classed as having a high risk of bias. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that nutritional therapy reduced mortality 0.80 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.99). The result was not confirmed in sequential analysis. Fixed-effect analysis suggested that nutrition prevented overt hepatic encephalopathy (0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.96) and infection (0.66; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.98, respectively), but the results were not confirmed in random-effects analyses. Conclusion: Our review suggests that nutritional therapy may have beneficial effects on clinical outcomes in cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis. High-quality trials are needed to verify our findings. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S."

We searched all randomized controlled trials published in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, and Clinical Trials.gov. The grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation framework was used to assess the quality of evidence. Seven studies were included (n = 520). Treated participants showed prolonged total sleep time (TST) by 24.36 minutes (P =.02). Sleep efficacy (SE) was marginally improved (P =.07). This effect was stronger under a longer intervention period lasting more than 4 weeks (P =.02). Conversely, cognitive function did not change significantly. Additionally, there was no report of severe adverse events. Given the current studies, we conclude that melatonin therapy may be effective in improving SE and prolonging TST in patients with dementia; however, there is no evidence that this improvement impacts cognitive function. ?

Use of barbed suture in total knee arthroplasty is still at nascent stage with only few studies comparing it with the standard closure techniques. The purpose of this review was to appraise the clinical outcomes of barbed suture use in closure of total knee arthroplasty. Methods: We searched the Cochrane library, PubMed and EMBASE up to December 2014 for clinical trials comparing the outcomes of closure of total knee arthroplasty with barbed sutures versus standard sutures. When there was no high heterogeneity, we used a fixed effects model. Dichotomous variables were presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95?% confidence intervals (CIs), and continuous data were measured as measured differences with 95?% CIs. Results: Five studies were included, with sample size ranging from 178 to 416. Fixed effect analysis showed that superficial infection was higher with barbed suture (RR 1.54, 95?% CI 0.36¡V2.59, P?=?0.94). The barbed sutures have significantly lower closure time (MI ?2.74, CI ?3.06, ?2.42, P?<?0.00001). There was no difference in terms of deep infection, wound dehiscence, arthrofibrosis and total operative time. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis showed that the use of barbed sutures was associated with increased superficial infection rate and shorter estimated closure time. More RCTs are needed to examine the efficacy and safety of the barbed sutures. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag France."

Materials and methods: A systematic review using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase Classic, Embase, AMED, the Cochrane Library, Open Grey, Orthopaedic Proceedings, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, US National Institute for Health Trials Registry, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The search was conducted on 3rd October 2014 and no language limits were applied. Inclusion criteria were all clinical study designs comparing external fixation with open reduction internal fixation of bicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Studies of only one treatment modality were excluded, as were those that included unicondylar tibial plateau fractures. Treatment effects from studies reporting dichotomous outcomes were summarised using odds ratios. Continuous outcomes were converted to standardized mean differences to assess the treatment effect, and inverse variance methods used to combine data. A fixed effect model was used for meta-analyses. Results: Patients undergoing external fixation were more likely to have returned to preinjury activities by six and twelve months (P?=?0.030) but not at 24?months follow-up. However, external fixation was complicated by a greater number of infections (OR 2.59, 95?% CI 1.25¡V5.36, P?=?0.01). There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of deep infection, venous thromboembolism, compartment syndrome, or need for re-operation between the two groups. Conclusion: Although external fixation and ORIF are associated with different complication profiles, both are acceptable strategies for managing bicondylar tibial plateau fractures.

In the last decades pirfenidone an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent has shown benefit in inhibit collagen production and has also demonstrated benefit in decline progression in IPF in physiological outcomes as Forced vital capacity (FVC), in clinical outcomes such as progression free survival (PFS) and a benefit in mortality but no in clinically relevant outcomes as exacerbations or worsening of IPF. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of physiological and clinical outcomes of pirfenidone compared to placebo in IPF. We performed a search with no language restriction. Two researchers performed literature search, quality assessment, data extraction and analysis. And was performed a summary of findings table following the GRADE approach. Results: We included 5 RCTs (Randomized controlled trials) in analysis. The meta-analysis resulted in a decrease in all cause-mortality (RR 0.52 IC 0.32-0.88) and IPF related mortality (RR 0.32 IC 0.14-0.75); other outcomes evaluated were worsening of IPF (RR 0.64 IC 0.50-0.83) and acute exacerbation (RR: 0.72 IC 0.30-1.66 respectively). Also there was a decrease in progression free survival (PFS) (RR 0.83 IC 0.74-0.92) compared to placebo. Conclusions: We observed significant differences in physiologic and clinically relevant outcomes such as reduction in all-cause mortality, IPF related mortality, worsening and exacerbation of IPF and PFS.

Therefore, we undertook this study of 91 published studies and made subgroup comparisons of hVISA/VISA incidence in different study years, locations, and types of clinical samples. We also analyzed the genetic backgrounds of these strains. Methods: A systematic literature review of relevant articles published in PubMed and EMBASE from January 1997 to August 2014 was conducted. We selected and assessed journal articles reporting the prevalence rates of hVISA/VISA. Results: The pooled prevalence of hVISA was 6.05% in 99,042 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains and that of VISA was 3.01% in 68,792 MRSA strains. The prevalence of hVISA was 4.68% before 2006, 5.38% in 2006-2009, and 7.01% in 2010-2014. VISA prevalence was 2.05%, 2.63%, and 7.93%, respectively. In a subgroup analysis of different isolation locations, the prevalence of hVISA strains was 6.81%in Asia and 5.60%in Europe/America, and that of VISA was 3.42%and 2.75%, respectively. The frequencies of hVISA isolated from blood culture samples and from all clinical samples were 9.81% and 4.68%, respectively, and those of VISA were 2.00% and 3.07%, respectively. The most prevalent genotype was staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) II, which accounted for 48.16% and 37.74% of hVISA and VISA, respectively. Sequence Type (ST) 239 was most prevalent. Conclusion: The prevalence of hVISA/VISA has been increasing in recent years, but has been grossly underestimated. Its incidence is higher in Asia than in Europe/America. hVISA is isolated from blood culture samples more often than from other samples. These strains are highly prevalent in epidemic MRSA strains. This study clarifies the epidemiology of hVISA/VISA and indicates that the detection of these strains and the control of nosocomial infections must be strengthened. ? 2015 Zhang et al.

This study aimed at determining the efficacy of rapamycin and rapalogs for reducing the size of TSC-associated solid tumors in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Methods: Our data sources included electronic searches of the PubMed. We included into our meta-analysis any type of non-randomized study that reported the use of rapamycin and rapalogs for reducing the size of TSC-associated solid tumors in patients with TSC. Data was entered into Cochrane Review Manager Version 5.3 and analyzed. Results: Four case reports and 4 clinical trials were included. Five patients from the case reports (all with SEGA) and 91 patients from the clinical trials (41 with SEGA, 63 with kidney angiomyolipoma and 5 with liver angiomyolipoma) were included into the analysis. Volume and diameter of SEGAs were significantly reduced by mean difference of 1.23 cc (95 % CI -2.32 to -0.13; p = 0.03) and 7.91 mm (95 % CI -11.82 to -4.01; p < 0.0001), respectively.

The primary endpoints included an early clinical treatment response (ECTR) defined as cessation of lesion spread at 48 to 72 h postrandomization and the test-of-cure (TOC) response defined as total resolution of the infection at 7 to 14 days posttreatment. The systematic review identified no placebo-controlled trials in ABSSSI, 4 placebo-controlled trials in uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection as a proxy for placebo in ABSSSI, 12 linezolid trials in ABSSSI, 3 ceftaroline trials in ABSSSI, and 2 trials for nonantibacterial treatment. The ECTR rates at 48 to 72 h and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 78.7% (95% CI, 61.1 to 96.3%) for linezolid, 74.0% (95% CI, 69.7 to 78.3%) for ceftaroline, and 59.0% (95% CI, 52.8 to 65.3%) for nonantibacterial treatment. The early clinical treatment effect could not be estimated, given no available placebo or proxy for placebo data for this endpoint. Clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity influenced the selection of trials for the meta-analysis of the TOC treatment effect estimation. The pooled estimates of the TOC treatment response were 31.0% (95% CI, 6.2 to 55.9%) for the proxy for placebo, 88.1% (95% CI, 81.0 to 95.1%) for linezolid, and 86.1% (95% CI, 83.7 to 88.6%) for ceftaroline.

Our analysis was mainly focused on the cutoff level. Meta-analysis was performed using conventional meta-analytical pooling and bivariate analysis. Our meta-analysis covered 28 individual studies, in which 896 out of 4214 patients were identified as IFI positive. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (AUC-SROC) curve were 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-0.81], 0.81 (95% CI, 0.80-0.83), 21.88 (95% CI, 12.62-37.93), and 0.8855, respectively. Subgroup analyses indicated that in cohort studies, the cutoff value of BDG at 80 pg/mL had the best diagnostic accuracy, whereas in case-control studies the cutoff value of 20 pg/mL had the best diagnostic accuracy; moreover, the AUC-SROC in cohort studies was lower than that in case-control studies. The cutoff value of 60 pg/mL has the best diagnostic accuracy with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group criteria as a reference standard. The 60 pg/mL cutoff value has the best diagnostic accuracy with the Fungitell assay compared to the BDG detection assay. The cutoff value of 20 pg/mL has the best diagnostic accuracy with the Fungitec G-test assay, and the cutoff value of 11 pg/mL has the best diagnostic accuracy with the Wako assay. Serum BDG detection is highly accurate for diagnosing IFIs. As such, 60 pg/mL of BDG level can be used as the best cutoff value to distinguish patients with IFIs from patients without IFI (mainly due to Candida and Aspergillus). ? 2014."

However there has been no systematic review on non-prescription antimicrobial use in these settings. This review thus intended to establish the burden, risk factors and effects of antimicrobial self-medication in Low and Middle Income Countries. Methods: In 2012, we registered a systematic review protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42012002508). We searched PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Embase databases using the following terms; ""self-medication"", ""non-prescription"", ?£á?self-treatment', ""antimicrobial"", ""antimalarial"", ""antibiotic"", ""antibacterial"" ""2002-2012"" and combining them using Boolean operators. We performed independent and duplicate screening and abstraction of study administrative data, prevalence, determinants, type of antimicrobial agent, source, disease conditions, inappropriate use, drug adverse events and clinical outcomes of antibiotic self-medication where possible. We performed a Random Effects Meta-analysis. Results: A total of thirty four (34) studies involving 31,340 participants were included in the review. The overall prevalence of antimicrobial self-medication was 38.8 % (95 % CI: 29.5-48.1). Most studies assessed non-prescription use of antibacterial (17/34: 50 %) and antimalarial (5/34: 14.7 %) agents. The common disease symptoms managed were, respiratory (50 %), fever (47 %) and gastrointestinal (45 %). The major sources of antimicrobials included, pharmacies (65.5 %), leftover drugs (50 %) and drug shops (37.5 %). Twelve (12) studies reported inappropriate drug use; not completing dose (6/12) and sharing of medicines (4/12). The main determinants of antimicrobial self-medication include, level of education, age, gender, past successful use, severity of illness and income. Reported negative outcomes of antimicrobial self-medication included, allergies (2/34: 5.9 %), lack of cure (4/34: 11.8 %) and causing death (2/34: 5.9 %). The commonly reported positive outcome was recovery from illness (4/34: 11.8 %).

Additionally, diabetic foot ulcers impose a significant economic burden on our health care systems as a result of complications such as infection, hospitalisation and amputation. The current gold standard treatment for diabetic foot ulcers is total contact casting. However, the rate of ulcer recurrence is high, indicating the need for more effective long-term treatment options. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically identify, critique and evaluate all literature investigating the effectiveness of Achilles tendon lengthening, gastrocnemius recession and selective plantar fascia release in healing and preventing diabetic foot ulcers. Review: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library from the earliest available date to November 2014. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Data from randomised-controlled trials were analysed using random effects meta-analysis. For all other studies, data were analysed descriptively. Eleven studies (614 participants) were included in the review, with a median sample size of 29 participants. Meta-analysis of two randomised-controlled trials found that there was no statistically significant difference between Achilles tendon lengthening or gastrocnemius recession and total contact casting for time to healing of diabetic foot ulcers (mean difference, MD, 8.22 days; 95 % CI, -18.99 to 35.43; P = 0.55; I  2  = 34 %) and the rate of ulcers healed (risk ratio, RR, 1.06; 95 % CI, 0.94 to 1.20; P = 0.34; I  2  = 41 %). The rate of ulcer recurrence was significantly lower following Achilles tendon lengthening or gastrocnemius recession than total contact casting (RR, 0.45; 95 % CI, 0.28 to 0.72; P < 0.001; I  2  = 0 %). Conclusions: Achilles tendon lengthening and gastrocnemius recession appear to be effective surgical treatments for healing diabetic foot ulcers. The rate of ulcer recurrence was lower following Achilles tendon lengthening or gastrocnemius recession procedures compared to total contact casting treatment alone. Therefore, these surgical procedures may provide viable treatment options for the management and prevention of diabetic foot ulcers. Further rigorous randomised-controlled trials with longer follow-up are required to determine the long-term effectiveness and safety of these procedures. ? 2015 Dallimore and Kaminski."

Conclusion: In short-term outcomes (5?years or less, with follow-up of 0¡V5?years), TKA had higher postoperative complications than UKA, but had lower revision rates. There was only one study that reported long-term survivorship (more than 5?years, with follow-up of 5¡V15?years). Further research that assesses long-term survivorship is necessary to better evaluate UKA and TKA in the treatment of unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag France."

METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE databases was conducted using various combination of the following stoma repair, laparoscopic, parastomal, and hernia. Case reports, studies with less than 5 patients, and articles not written in English were excluded. Eligible studies were further scrutinized with the 2011 levels of evidence from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Two authors reviewed and analyzed each study. If there was any discrepancy between scores, the study in question was referred to another author. A meta-analysis was performed using both random and fixed-effect models. Publication bias was evaluated using Begg's funnel plot and Egger's regression test. The primary outcome analyzed was recurrence of parastomal hernia. Secondary outcomes were mesh infection, surgical site infection, obstruction requiring reoperation, death, and other complications. Studies were grouped by operative technique where indicated. Except for recurrence, most postoperative morbidities were reported for the overall cohort and not by approach so they were analyzed across approach. RESULTS: Fifteen articles with a total of 469 patients were deemed eligible for review. Most postoperative morbidities were reported for the overall cohort, and not by approach. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was 1.8% (95%CI: 0.8-3.2), and there was no difference between techniques. The most common postoperative complication was surgical site infection, which was seen in 3.8% (95%CI: 2.3-5.7). Infected mesh was observed in 1.7% (95%CI: 0.7-3.1), and obstruction requiring reoperation also occurred in 1.7% (95%CI: 0.7-3.0). Other complications such as ileus, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection were noted in 16.6% (95%CI: 11.9-22.1). Eighty-one recurrences were reported overall for a recurrence rate of 17.4% (95%CI: 9.5-26.9). The recurrence rate was 10.2% (95%CI: 3.9-19.0) for the modified laparoscopic Sugarbaker approach, whereas the recurrence rate was 27.9% (95%CI: 12.3-46.9) for the keyhole approach. There were no intraoperative mortalities reported and six mortalities during the postoperative course. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic intraperitoneal mesh repair is safe and effective for treating parastomal hernia. A modified Sugarbaker approach appears to provide the best outcomes. ? The Author(s) 2015."

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Cochrane Library, and the EPOC register (December 2009 to February 2014); studies selected by the same search terms in previous systematic reviews (1980-2009). Review methods Included studies were randomised controlled trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after trials, and interrupted time series studies implementing an intervention to improve compliance with hand hygiene among healthcare workers in hospital settings and measuring compliance or appropriate proxies that met predefined quality inclusion criteria. When studies had not used appropriate analytical methods, primary data were re-analysed. Random effects and network meta-analyses were performed on studies reporting directly observed compliance with hand hygiene when they were considered sufficiently homogeneous with regard to interventions and participants. Information on resources required for interventions was extracted and graded into three levels. Results Of 3639 studies retrieved, 41 met the inclusion criteria (six randomised controlled trials, 32 interrupted time series, one non-randomised trial, and two controlled before-after studies). Meta-analysis of two randomised controlled trials showed the addition of goal setting to WHO-5 was associated with improved compliance (pooled odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 1.76; I2=81%). Of 22 pairwise comparisons from interrupted time series, 18 showed stepwise increases in compliance with hand hygiene, and all but four showed a trend for increasing compliance after the intervention. Network meta-analysis indicated considerable uncertainty in the relative effectiveness of interventions, but nonetheless provided evidence that WHO-5 is effective and that compliance can be further improved by adding interventions including goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability. Nineteen studies reported clinical outcomes; data from these were consistent with clinically important reductions in rates of infection resulting from improved hand hygiene for some but not all important hospital pathogens. Reported costs of interventions ranged from $225 to $4669 (?146-?3035; £á204- £á4229) per 1000 bed days. Conclusion Promotion of hand hygiene with WHO-5 is effective at increasing compliance in healthcare workers. Addition of goal setting, reward incentives, and accountability strategies can lead to further improvements.

Materials and Methods A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve comparative studies of robotic and laparoscopic colectomy. The databases searched were PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from January 2000 to October 2014. The Odds ratio, Risk difference and Mean difference were used as the summary statistics. Results A total of 12 studies, which included a total of 4,148 patients who had undergone robotic or laparoscopic colectomy, were included and analyzed. RC demonstrated a longer operative time (MD 41.52, P<0.00001) and higher cost (MD 2.42, P<0.00001) than did LC. The time to first flatus passage (MD-0.51, P = 0.003) and the length of hospital stay (MD-0.68, P = 0.01) were significantly shorter after RC. Additionally, the intraoperative blood loss (MD-16.82, P<0.00001) was significantly less in RC. There was also a significantly lower incidence of overall postoperative complications (OR 0.74, P = 0.02) and wound infections (RD-0.02, P = 0.03) after RC. No differences in the postoperative ileus, in the anastomotic leak, or in the conversion to open surgery rate and in the number of harvested lymph nodes outcomes were found between the approaches. Conclusions The present meta-Analysis, mainly based on observational studies, suggests that RC is more time-consuming and expensive than laparoscopy but that it results in faster recovery of bowel function, a shorter hospital stay, less blood loss and lower rates of both overall postoperative complications and wound infections.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of short-term outcomes,2015,International Journal of Colorectal Disease,10.1007/s00384-015-2324-5,26194990,"Purpose: Several studies compared the outcomes of laparoscopically completed colorectal resections (LCR) to those requiring conversion to open surgery (COS). However, a comparative analysis between COS patients and patients undergoing planned open surgery (POS) would be useful to clarify if the conversion can be considered a simple drawback or a complication, being cause of additional postoperative morbidity. The aim of this study is to perform a meta-analysis of current evidences comparing postoperative outcomes of COS patients to POS patients. Methods: A systematic search of Medline, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Scopus was performed to identify studies reporting short-term outcomes of COS and POS patients. Primary outcomes were 30-day overall morbidity and length of postoperative hospital stay. Data were analyzed with fixed-effect modeling, and sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Twenty studies involving 30,656 patients undergoing POS and 1935 COS patients were selected. The mean conversion rate was 0.17. Similar 30-day overall morbidity and length of postoperative hospital stay were found in COS and POS patients. Wound infection (OR 1.43, 95?% CI 1.12 to 1.83, p < 0.01) was higher in the COS group. Other results were robust. Outcomes were comparable for patients undergoing resection for different natures of the disease (benign vs. malignant) and at different sites (colon vs. rectum). Conclusion: Conversions from laparoscopic to open procedure during colorectal resection are not associated with a poorer postoperative outcome compared to patients undergoing planned open surgery, except for a higher risk of wound infection. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether ultrasound guidance of subclavian vein catheterization reduces catheterization failures and adverse events compared to the traditional ""blind"" landmark method. All forms of ultrasound were included (dynamic 2D ultrasound, static 2D ultrasound, and Doppler). Data Sources: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL (from inception to September 2014). Study Selection: Randomized controlled trials of ultrasound compared to landmark technique for subclavian catheterization in adult populations were considered. Outcomes of interest included safety and failure of catheterization. Data Extraction: Adverse event data were analyzed according to Peto's method and expressed as odd ratios and 95% CIs. Failure of catheterization was analyzed with inverse variance random effects modeling and expressed as risk ratios and 95% CI. Data Synthesis: Six hundred and one studies were reviewed and 10 met inclusion criteria (n = 2,168 participants). Six used dynamic 2D ultrasound (n = 719), one used static 2D ultrasound (n = 821), and three used Doppler-guided insertion techniques (n = 628). Overall complication rates were reduced with ultrasound use compared to the landmark group (odd ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41-0.69). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that dynamic 2D ultrasound reduced inadvertent arterial puncture, pneumothorax, and hematoma formation. No difference in failure of catheterization was noted between the ultrasound group and the landmark method (risk ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.48-1.51). Subgroup analysis of dynamic 2D ultrasound demonstrated a significant decrease in failed catheterization (risk ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.92). Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided subclavian catheterization reduced the frequency of adverse events compared with the landmark technique. Our findings support the use of dynamic 2D ultrasound for subclavian catheterization to reduce adverse events and failed catheterization. ? 2015 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."

Soluble CD14 subtype (sCD14-ST), recently re-named presepsin, was identified as a new marker for the diagnosis of sepsis in several reports. However, the findings were based on the results of individual clinical trials, rather than a comprehensive and overall estimation. Thus, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled accuracy of presepsin in patients with sepsis suspect. Methods A comprehensive electronic search was performed via internet retrieval system up to 15 December 2014. Methodological quality assessment was applied by using the QUADAS2 tool. The diagnostic value of presepsin in sepsis was evaluated by using the pooled estimate of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio, as well as summary receiver operating characteristics curve. Results Nine studies with 10 trials and 2159 cases were included in the study. Only two trials had low concerns regarding applicability, whereas all trials were deemed to be at high risk of bias. Heterogeneity existed in the non-threshold effect, but not in the threshold effect. The pooled sensitivity of presepsin for sepsis was 0.78 (0.76-0.80), pooled specificity was 0.83 (0.80-0.85), pooled positive likelihood ratio was 4.63 (3.27-6.55), pooled negative likelihood ratio was 0.22 (0.16-0.30), and pooled diagnostic odds ratio was 21.73 (12.81- 36.86). The area under curve of summary receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.89 (95%CI: 0.84 to 0.94) and Q? index was 0.82 (95%CI: 0.77 to 0.87). Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates that presepsin had some superiority in the management of patients, and may be a helpful and valuable biomarker in early diagnosis of sepsis. However, presepsin showed a moderate diagnostic accuracy in differentiating sepsis from nonsepsis which prevented it from being recommended as a definitive test for diagnosing sepsis in isolation, but the results should be interpreted cautiously. ? 2015 Wu et al."

However, no single study has been large enough to definitively determine whether fibrin sealant is safe and effective. We report a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of fibrin sealant in total knee arthroplasty. Methods: Articles published before August, 2012 were identified from PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other internet databases. Relevant journals and the recommendations of expert panels were also searched manually. We included only high-quality RCTs. Two independent reviewers searched and assessed the literature. Relevant data were analysed using RevMan 5.0. Results: Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria.

The objective of this research is to systematically review the literature and determine the risk of fetal, neonatal and maternal death associated with cholera during pregnancy. Materials and Methods Medline, Global Health Library, and Cochrane Library databases were searched using the key terms cholera and pregnancy for articles published in any language and at any time before August 2013 to quantitatively summarize estimates of fetal, maternal, and neonatal mortality. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each selected study. Randomeffect non-linear logistic regression was used to calculate pooled rates and 95% CIs by time period. Studies from the recent period (1991-2013) were compared with studies from 1969-1990. Relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% CIs were obtained by comparing mortality of selected recent studies with published national normative data from the closest year. Results The meta-analysis included seven studies that together involved 737 pregnant women with cholera from six countries. The pooled fetal death rate for 4 studies during 1991-2013 was 7.9% (95% CIs 5.3-10.4), significantly lower than that of 3 studies from 1969-1990 (31.0%, 95% CIs 25.2-36.8). There was no difference in fetal death rate by trimester. The pooled neonatal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.8% (95% CIs 0.0-1.6), and 6.4% (95% CIs 0.0-20.8) for 1969-1990. The pooled maternal death rate for 1991-2013 studies was 0.2% (95% CIs 0.0-0.7), and 5.0% (95% CIs 0.0-16.0) for 1969-1990. Compared with published national mortality estimates, the RR for fetal death of 5.8 (95% CIs 2.9-11.3) was calculated for Haiti (2013), 1.8 (95% CIs 0.3-10.4) for Senegal (2007), and 2.6 (95% CIs 0.5-14.9) for Peru (1991); there were no significant differences in the RR for neonatal or maternal death. Conclusion Results are limited by the inconsistencies found across included studies but suggest that maternal cholera is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly fetal death. These findings can inform a research agenda on cholera in pregnancy and guidance for the timely management of pregnant women with cholera. ? 2015 Tran et al.

However, the usefulness of the NRS 2002 for predicting is controversial. This meta-analysis was to examine whether a preoperative evaluation of nutritional risk by NRS 2002 provided prediction of postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Methods: A systematic literature search for published papers was conducted using the following online databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library, EBSCO, CRD databases, Cinahl, PsycInfo and BIOSIS previews. The pooled odds ratio (OR) or weight mean difference (WMD) was calculated using a random-effect model or a fix-effect model. Results: Eleven studies with a total of 3527 patients included in this study. Postoperative overall complications were more frequent in nutritional risk patients versus patients without nutritional risk (the pooled OR 3.13 [2.51, 3.90] p<0.00001). The pooled OR of mortality for the nutritional risk group and non-nutritional risk group was 3.61 [1.38, 9.47] (p = 0.009). Furthermore, the postoperative hospital stay was significant longer in the preoperative nutritional risk group than in the nutritional normal group (WMD 5.58 [4.21, 6.95] p<0.00001). Conclusions: The present study has demonstrated that patients at preoperative nutritional risk have increased complication rates, high mortality and prolonged hospital stay after surgery. However, NRS 2002 needs to be validated in larger samples of patients undergoing abdominal surgery by better reference method. ? 2015 Sun et al.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to synthesize the evidence on the comparative effectiveness and safety of oral mechanical bowel preparation versus no preparation or enema. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CINAHL without any language restrictions (last search on September 6, 2013). We also searched the US Food and Drug Administration Web site and ClinicalTrials.gov and supplemented our searches by asking technical experts and perusing reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: We included English-language, full-text reports of randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized comparative studies of patients undergoing elective colon or rectal surgery. For adverse events we also included single-group cohort studies of at least 200 participants. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included oral mechanical bowel preparation, oral mechanical bowel preparation plus enema, enema only, and no oral mechanical bowel preparation or enema. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anastomotic leakage, all-cause mortality, wound infection, peritonitis/intra-abdominal abscess, reoperation, surgical site infection, quality of life, length of stay, and adverse events were measured. We synthesized results across studies qualitatively and with Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 18 randomized clinical trials, 7 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 6 single-group cohorts were included. In meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials, the credibility intervals of the summary OR included the null value of 1.0 for comparisons of oral mechanical bowel preparation and either no oral preparation or enema for overall mortality, anastomotic leakage, wound infection, peritonitis, surgical site infection, and reoperation. These results were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. Evidence on adverse events was sparse. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by weaknesses in the underlying evidence, such as incomplete reporting of relevant information, exclusion of non-English and relevant unpublished studies, and possible missed indexing of nonrandomized studies.

Objective This study evaluated differences in outcome variables between percutaneous and open pedicle screws for traumatic thoracolumbar fractures. Methods A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was performed. The variables of interest included postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, kyphosis angle, and vertebral body height, as well as intraoperative blood loss and operative time. The results were pooled by calculating the effect size based on the standardized difference in means. The studies were weighted by the inverse of the variance, which included both within- and between-study error. Confidence intervals were reported at 95%. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I 2. Results After two-reviewer assessment, 38 studies were eliminated. Six studies were found to meet inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The combined effect size was found to be in favor of percutaneous fixation for blood loss and operative time (p &lt; 0.05); however, there were no differences in vertebral body height (VBH), kyphosis angle, or VAS scores between open and percutaneous fixation. All of the studies demonstrated relative homogeneity, with I 2 &lt; 25. Conclusions Patients with thoracolumbar fractures can be effectively managed with percutaneous or open pedicle screw placement. There are no differences in VBH, kyphosis angle, or VAS between the two groups. Blood loss and operative time were decreased in the percutaneous group, which may represent a potential benefit, particularly in the polytraumatized patient.

A Network Meta-analysis,2015,Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,10.1007/s11999-015-4224-y,25724836,"Background: Open tibial shaft fractures are one of the most devastating orthopaedic injuries. Surgical treatment options include reamed or unreamed nailing, plating, Ender nails, Ilizarov fixation, and external fixation. Using a network meta-analysis allows comparison and facilitates pooling of a diverse population of randomized trials across these approaches in ways that a traditional meta-analysis does not. Questions/purposes: Our aim was to perform a network meta-analysis using evidence from randomized trials on the relative effect of alternative approaches on the risk of unplanned reoperation after open fractures of the tibial diaphysis. Our secondary study endpoints included malunion, deep infection, and superficial infection. Methods: A network meta-analysis allows for simultaneous consideration of the relative effectiveness of multiple treatment alternatives. To do this on the subject of surgical treatments for open tibial fractures, we began with systematic searches of databases (including EMBASE and MEDLINE) and performed hand searches of orthopaedic journals, bibliographies, abstracts from orthopaedic conferences, and orthopaedic textbooks, for all relevant material published between 1980 and 2013. Two authors independently screened abstracts and manuscripts and extracted the data, three evaluated the risk of bias in individual studies, and two applied Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to bodies of evidence. We included all randomized and quasirandomized trials comparing two (or more) surgical treatment options for open tibial shaft fractures in predominantly (ie,?>?80%) adult patients. We calculated pooled estimates for all direct comparisons and conducted a network meta-analysis combining direct and indirect evidence for all 15 comparisons between six stabilization strategies. Fourteen trials published between 1989 and November 2011 met our inclusion criteria; the trials comprised a total of 1279 patients surgically treated for open tibial shaft fractures. Results: Moderate confidence evidence showed that unreamed nailing may reduce the likelihood of reoperation compared with external fixation (network odds ratio [OR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23¡V0.62; p?<?0.05), although not necessarily compared with reamed nailing (direct OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.45¡V1.24; p?=?0.25). Only low- or very low-quality evidence informed the primary outcome for other treatment comparisons, such as those involving internal plate fixation, Ilizarov external fixation, and Ender nailing. Method ranking based on reoperation data showed that unreamed nailing had the highest probability of being the best treatment, followed by reamed nailing, external fixation, and plate fixation. CIs around pooled estimates of malunion and infection risk were very wide, and therefore no conclusive results could be made based on these data. Conclusion: Current evidence suggests that intramedullary nailing may be superior to other fixation strategies for open tibial shaft fractures. Use of unreamed nails over reamed nails also may be advantageous in the setting of open fractures, but this remains to be confirmed. Unfortunately, these conclusions are based on trials that have had high risk of bias and poor precision. Larger and higher-quality head-to-head randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these conclusions and better inform clinical decision-making.

Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis,2015,International Journal of Colorectal Disease,10.1007/s00384-015-2304-9,26137968,"Purpose: While definitive long-term results are not yet available, the global safety and oncologic adequacy of laparoscopic surgery for right colectomy remain controversial. The aim of the study was to evaluate differences in safety of laparoscopic right colectomy, compared with open surgery, with particular attention to cancer patients. Methods: A systematic review from 1991 to 2014 was performed searching the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (PROSPERO Registration number: CRD42014015256). We included randomised and controlled clinical studies comparing laparoscopic and open resection for rectal cancer. Primary endpoints were 30?days mortality and overall morbidity. Then, a meta-analysis was conducted by a fixed-effect model, performing a sensitivity analysis by a random-effect model. Relative risk (RR) was used as an indicator of treatment effect; a RR less than 1.0 was in favour of laparoscopy. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot, heterogeneity by the I2 test and subgroup analysis on oncologic patients. Results: Twenty-seven studies, representing 3049 patients, met the inclusion criteria; only 2 were randomised for a total of 211 patients. Mortality was observed in 1.2?% of patients in the laparoscopic group and in 3.4?% of patients in the open group. The overall RR was 0.45 (95?% CI 0.21¡V0.93, p = 0.031). The raw incidence of overall complications was significantly lower in the laparoscopic group (16.8?%) compared to the open group (24.2?%). The overall RR was 0.81 (95?% CI 0.70¡V0.95, p = 0.007). Conclusions: Based on the evidence of few randomised and mostly controlled series, mortality and morbidity were significantly lower after laparoscopy compared to open surgery. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether there is a correlation between Merkel cell carcinoma and Merkel cell polyomavirus. Studies assessing the relationship between Merkel cell carcinoma and Merkel cell polyomavirus from January 2008 to August 2014 were pooled from Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews and Google Scholar. From each study we collected the first author's last name, publication year, country of origin, type of study design, characteristics of participants, possible variables incorporated into the multivariable analyses and the risk ratio (RR) for Merkel cell carcinoma associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus combined with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Methodological assessment of the study was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Crude RR was calculated from the data provided in each article. Meta-analyses for the global RR and for the proportion of positives in both case and control samples were performed. In addition, in order to explore the sources of heterogeneity among the studies, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses are also provided. A total of 22 studies were identified for the analysis. The pooled RR from random-effects analysis was determined to be 6¡P32 (95% CI, 4¡P02-9¡P93).

Material and methods: A meta-analysis was performed by analyzing all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English that compared SILA and CTLA for appendicitis in adults and children. These studies compared these two methods from different angles including outcomes of interest, patient characteristics, operative time, pain visual analogue scales scores (VAS scores), length of hospital stay, time to return to full activity, resumption of diet, postoperative complications and cosmetic results The risk ratios (RR) and mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed to assess the outcome. Results:Seven recent RCTs encompassing 1170 patients (586 SILA and 584 CTLA cases) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that conversion rate, drain inserted, reoperation, length of hospital stay, resumption of normal diet and postoperative complications were statistically comparable between the two groups. The postoperative abdominal pain within 24 h was -0.57 in favor of the SILA technique (p = 0.05). Compared with CTLA, SILA showed a better cosmetic satisfaction score (SMD, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32-0.83; p < 0.0001) and shorter time to recover normal activity (WMD, -0.69; 95% CI, -1.11-0.26; p = 0.001). However, SILA has a longer operative time (WMD, 5.38; 95% CI, 2.94-7.83; p < 0.0001). Conclusions:In selected patients, SILA was confirmed to be as safe and effective as CTLA.

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of the benefits and adverse events (AEs) of cannabinoids. DATA SOURCES: Twenty-eight databases from inception to April 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials of cannabinoids for the following indications: nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, appetite stimulation in HIV/AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity due to multiple sclerosis or paraplegia, depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorder, psychosis, glaucoma, or Tourette syndrome. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. All review stages were conducted independently by 2 reviewers. Where possible, data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patient-relevant/disease-specific outcomes, activities of daily living, quality of life, global impression of change, and AEs. RESULTS: A total of 79 trials (6462 participants) were included; 4 were judged at low risk of bias. Most trials showed improvement in symptoms associated with cannabinoids but these associations did not reach statistical significance in all trials. Compared with placebo, cannabinoids were associated with a greater average number of patients showing a complete nausea and vomiting response (47% vs 20%; odds ratio [OR], 3.82 [95% CI, 1.55-9.42]; 3 trials), reduction in pain (37% vs 31%; OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.99-2.00]; 8 trials), a greater average reduction in numerical rating scale pain assessment (on a 0-10-point scale; weighted mean difference [WMD], -0.46 [95% CI, -0.80 to -0.11]; 6 trials), and average reduction in the Ashworth spasticity scale (WMD, -0.36 [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.05]; 7 trials). There was an increased risk of short-term AEs with cannabinoids, including serious AEs. Common AEs included dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, somnolence, euphoria, vomiting, disorientation, drowsiness, confusion, loss of balance, and hallucination. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity. There was low-quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids were associated with improvements in nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy, weight gain in HIV infection, sleep disorders, and Tourette syndrome.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Main outcom e measures Pain and physical function. Data sources Systematic searches for benefits and harms were carried out in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to August 2014. Only studies published in 2000 or later were included for harms. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials assessing benefit of arthroscopic surgery involving partial meniscectomy, debridement, or both for patients with or without radiographic signs of osteoarthritis were included. For harms, cohort studies, register based studies, and case series were also allowed. Results The search identified nine trials assessing the benefits of knee arthroscopic surgery in middle aged and older patients with knee pain and degenerative knee disease. The main analysis, combining the primary endpoints of the individual trials from three to 24 months postoperatively, showed a small difference in favour of interventions including arthroscopic surgery compared with control treatments for pain (effect size 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.26). This difference corresponds to a benefit of 2.4 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 4.3) mm on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. When analysed over time of follow-up, interventions including arthroscopy showed a small benefit of 3-5 mm for pain at three and six months but not later up to 24 months. No significant benefit on physical function was found (effect size 0.09, -0.05 to 0.24). Nine studies reporting on harms were identified. Harms included symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (4.13 (95% confidence interval 1.78 to 9.60) events per 1000 procedures), pulmonary embolism, infection, and death. Conclusions The small inconsequential benefit seen from interventions that include arthroscopy for the degenerative knee is limited in time and absent at one to two years after surgery.

While long-lasting insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are highly effective interventions, this study tests the hypothesis that improved housing can reduce malaria by decreasing house entry by malaria mosquitoes. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess whether modern housing is associated with a lower risk of malaria than traditional housing, across all age groups and malaria-endemic settings. Six electronic databases were searched to identify intervention and observational studies published from 1 January, 1900 to 13 December, 2013, measuring the association between house design and malaria. The primary outcome measures were parasite prevalence and incidence of clinical malaria. Crude and adjusted effects were combined in fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses, with sub-group analyses for: overall house type (traditional versus modern housing); screening; main wall, roof and floor materials; eave type; ceilings and elevation. Results: Of 15,526 studies screened, 90 were included in a qualitative synthesis and 53 reported epidemiological outcomes, included in a meta-analysis. Of these, 39 (74 %) showed trends towards a lower risk of epidemiological outcomes associated with improved house features. Of studies assessing the relationship between modern housing and malaria infection (n?=?11) and clinical malaria (n?=?5), all were observational, with very low to low quality evidence. Residents of modern houses had 47 % lower odds of malaria infection compared to traditional houses (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0¢X53, 95 % confidence intervals (CI) 0¢X42-0¢X67, p?<?0¢X001, five studies) and a 45-65 % lower odds of clinical malaria (case-control studies: adjusted OR 0¢X35, 95 % CI 0¢X20-0¢X62, p <0¢X001, one study; cohort studies: adjusted rate ratio 0¢X55, 95 % CI 0¢X36-0¢X84, p?=?0¢X005, three studies). Evidence of a high risk of bias was found within studies. Conclusions: Despite low quality evidence, the direction and consistency of effects indicate that housing is an important risk factor for malaria.

Globally, an increase in NTM infections has been reported from many countries around the world. However, limited information is available about the prevalence of NTM infections in Iran. Material and Methods: The data of the prevalence of NTM infections were collected from databases such as PubMed, Web of science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, Iranmedex, and Scientific Information Database. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (V2.0, Biostat) software was used to analyze the data. Results: The meta-analyses showed that the prevalence of NTM infections was 10.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.3-15.9) among culture-positive cases of tuberculosis (TB) in Iran. The further stratified analyses indicated that the prevalence of NTM was higher in studies that were done after year 2000. Additionally, M. simiae (43.3% [95% CI 36.8-50.0]), M. intracellucar (27.3% [95% CI 0.7-95.5]) and M. fortuitum (22.7% [95% CI 16.1-30.9]) were the most prevalent NTM species, respectively. Discussion: The relatively high prevalence of NTM infections (10.2%) among culture positive cases for TB underlines the need for greater enforcement of infection control strategies. Establishment of appropriate diagnostic criteria and management guidelines for NTM diseases and expanding the number and quality of regional reference laboratories may facilitate more accurate action for prevention and control of NTM infections in Iran. ? 2015 Nasiri et al.

Several factors may be contributing to this, including mobile populations, which if infected, may spread the disease. A wide range of estimates have been published for S. japonicum infections in mobile populations, and a synthesis of these data will elucidate the relative risk presented from these groups. Methods: A literature search for publications up to Oct 31, 2014 on S. japonicum infection in mobile populations in previously endemic but now non-endemic regions was conducted using four bibliographic databases: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, VIP Chinese Journal Databases, and PubMed. A meta-analysis was conducted by pooling one arm binary data with MetaAnalyst Beta 3.13. The protocol is available on PROSPERO (No. CRD42013005967). Results: A total of 41 studies in Chinese met the inclusion criteria, covering seven provinces of China. The time of post-interruption surveillance ranged from the first year to the 31st year. After employing a random-effects model, from 1992 to 2013 the pooled seroprevalence ranged from 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5-1.6%) in 2003 to 2.3% (95% CI: 1.5-3.4) in 1995; from the first year after the disease had been interrupted to the 31st year, the pooled seroprevalence ranged from 0.6% (95% CI: 0.2-2.1%) in the 27th year to 4.0% (95%CI: 1.3-11.3%) in the second year. The pooled seroprevalence in mobile populations each year was significantly lower than among the residents of endemic regions, whilst four papers reported a lower level of infection in the mobile populations than in the local residents out of only 13 papers which included this data. Conclusions: The re-emergence of S. japonicum in areas which had previously interrupted transmission might be due to other factors, although risk from re-introduction from mobile populations could not be excluded. ? 2015 Bian et al.

As with most education efforts, CDC's influenza-related communications are often informed by formative research. Methods: A qualitative meta-analysis of 29 unpublished, primarily qualitative CDC-sponsored studies related to flu and flu vaccination knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (KABs). The studies, undertaken between 2000 and 2013, involved focus groups, in-depth interviews, message testing and surveys. Some involved health care professionals, while others involved members of the public, including sub-populations at risk for severe illness. Findings: The themes that emerged suggested progress in terms of KABs related to influenza and influenza vaccination, but also the persistence of many barriers to vaccine acceptance. With respect to the public, recurring themes included limited understanding of influenza and immunization recommendations, indications of greater sub-group recognition of the value of flu vaccination, continued resistance to vaccination among many, and overestimation of the effectiveness of non-vaccine measures. Seven cognitive facilitators of vaccination were identified in the studies along with six cognitive barriers. For health care providers, the analysis suggests greater knowledge and more favorable beliefs, but many misperceptions persist and are similar to those held by the public. KABs often differed by type or category of health care provider. Conclusions: The themes identified in this qualitative analysis illustrate the difficulty in changing KABs related to influenza and influenza vaccine, particularly on the scope and scale needed to greatly improve uptake. Even with an influenza pandemic and more vaccine options available, public and some health care provider perceptions and beliefs are difficult and slow to change. This meta-analysis does, however, provide important insights from previously unpublished information that can help those who are promoting influenza vaccination to health care providers, the general public and specific populations within the general population. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Because pharmaceutical care might contribute to improved adherence to treatment, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of pharmaceutical interventions on ART via a systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCT). Methods Study selection, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Results and discussion A total of 681 studies were located; only four of these met the inclusion criteria and were analysed. The summary measure corresponding to the outcome adherence to treatment was 1¡P47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0¡P81-2¡P65), and the measure corresponding to the outcome virologic suppression was 1¡P95 (95% CI: 0¡P61-6¡P25). What is new and conclusion The results suggest that pharmaceutical interventions might contribute to improved adherence to ART and the achievement of virologic suppression, although the differences between the intervention and control groups were not statistically significant. Pharmaceutical interventions might be more efficacious in populations with low adherence to treatment and greater vulnerability. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pharmaceutical interventions on antiretroviral therapy (ART) via a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.

Objectives: The aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of RCTs investigating the surgical and postsurgical outcomes of elective incisional hernia by open versus laparoscopic method. Data sources: A search of PubMed, Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials published between January 1993 and September 2013 was performed using medical subject headings (MESH) ¡§hernia,¡¨ ¡§incisional,¡¨ ¡§abdominal,¡¨ ¡§randomized/randomised controlled trial,¡¨ ¡§abdominal wall hernia,¡¨ ¡§laparoscopic repair,¡¨ ¡§open repair¡¨, ¡§human¡¨ and ¡§English¡¨. Study eligibility criteria, participants and interventions: Prospective RCTs comparing surgical treatment of only incisional hernia (and not primary ventral hernias) using open and laparoscopic methods were selected. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Data extraction and critical appraisal were carried out independently by two authors (AA and MAM) using predefined data fields. The outcome variables analyzed included (a) hernia diameter; (b) operative time; (c) length of hospital stay; (d) overall complication rate; (e) bowel complications; (f) reoperation; (g) wound infection; (h) wound hematoma or seroma; (i) time to oral intake; (j) back to work; (k) recurrence rate; and (l) postoperative neuralgia. These outcomes were unanimously decided to be important since they influence the practical and surgical approach towards hernia management within hospitals and institutions. The quality of RCTs was assessed using Jadad¡¦s scoring system. Random effects model was used to calculate the effect size of both binary and continuous data. Heterogeneity amongst the outcome variables of these trials was determined by the Cochran Q statistic and I2 index. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Results: Sufficient data were available for the analysis of twelve clinically relevant outcomes. Statistically significant reduction in bowel complications was noted with open surgery compared to the laparoscopic repair in five studies (OR 2.56, 95?% CI 1.15, 5.72, p?=?0.02). Comparable effects were noted for other variables which include hernia diameter (SMD ?0.27, 95?% CI ?0.77, 0.23, p?=?0.29), operative time (SMD ?0.08, 95?% CI ?4.46, 4.30, p?=?0.97), overall complications (OR ?1.07, 95?% CI ?0.33, 3.42, p?=?0.91), wound infection (OR 0.49, 95?% CI 0.09, 2.67, p?=?0.41), wound hematoma or seroma (OR 1.54, 95?% CI 0.58, 4.09, p?=?0.38), reoperation rate (OR ?0.32, 95?% CI 0.07, 1.43, p?=?0.14), time to oral intake (SMD ?0.16, 95?% CI ?1.97, 2.28, p?=?0.89), length of hospital stay (SMD ?0.83, 95?% CI ?2.22, 0.56, p?=?0.24), back to work (SMD ?3.14, 95?% CI ?8.92, 2.64, p?=?0.29), recurrence rate (OR 1.41, 95?% CI 0.81, 2.46, p?=?0.23), and postoperative neuralgia (OR 0.48, 95?% CI 0.16, 1.46, p?=?0.20). Conclusions: On the basis of our meta-analysis, we conclude that laparoscopic and open repair of incisional hernia is comparable. A larger randomized controlled multicenter trial with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria and standardized techniques for both repairs is required to demonstrate the superiority of one technique over the other. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag France."

METHODS: We electronically searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from January 1980 to December 2013 to identify relevant studies reporting risk factors for NODM after liver transplantation. Two authors independently assessed the trials for inclusion and extracted the data. Discrepancies were resolved in consultation with a third reviewer. All statistical analyses were performed with the RevMan5.0 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, United Kingdom). Pooled odds ratios (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using either a fixed effects or a random effects model, based on the presence (I2 &lt; 50%) or absence (I2 &gt; 50%) of significant heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty studies with 4580 patients were included in the meta-analysis, all of which were retrospective. The meta-analysis identified the following significant risk factors: hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (OR = 2.68; 95%CI: 1.92-3.72); a family history of diabetes (OR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.09-2.63, P &lt; 0.00001); male gender (OR = 1.53; 95%CI: 1.24-1.90; P &lt; 0.0001); impaired fasting glucose (IFG; OR = 3.27; 95%CI: 1.84-5.81; P &lt; 0.0001); a family history of diabetes (OR = 1.69; 95%CI: 1.09-2.63; P = 0.02); use of tacrolimus (OR = 1.34; 95%CI: 1.03-1.76; P = 0.03) and body mass index (BMI)(WMD = 1.19, 95%CI: 0.69-1.68, P &lt; 0.00001).

However, there is clinical uncertainty over optimal management. This study aimed to examine the safety and effectiveness of surgical management for treatment of VCFs with osteopenia compared with non-surgical treatment. Methods: We conducted a systematic search through electronic databases from inception to June 2014, with no limits on study data or language. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating surgical versus non-surgical interventions for treatment of patients with VCFs due to osteopenia were considered. Primary outcomes were pain and adverse effects. A randomeffects model was used to calculate the pooled mean difference (MD) or risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Sixteen reports (11 studies) met the inclusion criteria, and provided data for the meta-analysis with a total of 1,401 participants. Compared with conservative treatment, surgical treatment was more effective in reducing pain (short-term: MD -2.05, 95% CI -3.55 to -0.56, P=0.007; mid-term: MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.62, P=0.002; long-term: MD -1.24, 95% CI -2.20 to -0.29, P=0.01) and disability on the Roland-Morris Disability score (short-term: MD -4.97, 95% CI -8.71 to -1.23, P=0.009), as well as improving quality of life on the Short-Form 36 Physical Component Summary score (short-term: MD 5.53, 95% CI 1.45 to 9.61, P=0.008) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis score (short-term: MD -5.01, 95% CI -8.11 to -1.91, P=0.002). Indirect comparisons between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty found no evidence that the treatment effect differed across the two interventions for any outcomes assessed. Compared with the sham procedure, surgical treatment showed no evidence of improvement in pain relief and physical function. Based on these two comparisons, no significant difference between groups was noted in the pooled results for adverse events. Conclusion: Compared to conservative treatment, surgical treatment was more effective in decreasing pain in the short,mid and long terms. However, no significant mid- and long-term differences in physical function and quality of life was observed. Little good evidence is available for surgical treatment compared with that for sham procedure. PV and BK are currently used to treat VCFs with osteopenia, with little difference in treatment effects. Evidence of better quality and from a larger sample size is required before a recommendation can be made. ? 2015 Guo et al."

Methods: A computerized literature search was conducted to identify studies that assessed the diagnostic value of 16S rRNA gene PCR test for bloodstream infections. Study quality was assessed using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each study. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was used to summarize overall test performance. Statistical analysis was performed in Meta-DiSc 1.4 and Stata/SE 12.0 software. Results: Twenty-eight studies were included in our meta-analysis. Using random-effect model analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, and DOR were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.89), 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.95), 12.65 (95% CI, 8.04-19.90), 0.14 (95% CI, 0.08-0.24), and 116.76 (95% CI, 52.02-262.05), respectively. The SROC curve indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.9690 and the maximum joint sensitivity and specificity (Q?) was 0.9183. In addition, heterogeneity was statistically significant but was not caused by the threshold effect. Conclusion: Existing data suggest that 16S rRNA gene PCR test is a practical tool for the rapid screening of sepsis.

Previous trials have shown conflicting results concerning the efficacy of high or low doses of daunorubicin to induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to resolve this controversial issue. We compared the efficacy and safety of high doses of daunorubicin (HD-DNR) and traditional low doses of daunorubicin (LD-DNR) or idarubicin (IDA) during induction therapy of newly diagnosed AML. Data of 3,824 patients from 1,796 articles in the literature were retrieved and six randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival (EFS). The secondary outcomes included complete remission (CR), relapse, and toxicity. The meta-analysis results suggest that comparing HD-DNR with LD-DNR, there were significant differences in CR (RR = 1.19, 95%CI[1.12,1.18], p<0.00001), OS(HR = 0.88, 95% CI[0.79,0.99], p = 0.002), and EFS (HR = 0.86, 95%CI [0.74, 1.00], p = 0.008), but not in DFS, relapse, and toxicity. There were no statistically significant differences in any other outcomes between HD-DNR and IDA. The analysis indicates that compared with LD-DNR, HD-DNR can significantly improve CR, OS and EFS but not DFS, and did not increase occurrence of relapse and toxicity. ? 2015 Gong et al.

Despite current prophylactic measures, rates of SSIs have been reported in up to 15% of patients undergoing spine surgery. The adjunctive local application of vancomycin powder in spine surgery is a low-cost strategy to help reduce SSIs. Vancomycin is active against skin pathogens that can potentially contaminate the wound during spinal surgery. The local application of vancomycin in its powder form ensures adequate surgical-site concentrations while minimizing adverse effects caused by undetectable systemic distribution. However, clinical studies have produced conflicting results, and the clinical evidence behind the use of vancomycin powder in modern spinal surgery practices is not clear. Purpose To examine the current clinical evidence on the use of vancomycin powder in spine surgery. Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of literature. Methods A comprehensive search of the English literature was conducted with PubMed (MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria consisted of intrawound vancomycin powder use in spine surgery as a prophylactic agent for SSIs. Studies that investigated nonspine surgeries, selected patients on the basis of clinical suspicion, or included patients with infections were excluded. Studies that compared intrawound vancomycin in spine surgery against their standard practice were pooled in the meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Results A total of 671 abstracts were reviewed, and 18 papers met inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in this review. These included 1 randomized controlled trial, 13 comparative studies, and 4 case series. The level of evidence in hierarchical order was as follows: 1 level II, 13 level III, and 4 level IV. Fourteen of the studies, 1 randomized controlled trial and 13 comparative studies, were eligible for the meta-analysis. The odds of developing a deep infection with intrawound vancomycin powder were 0.23 times the odds of experiencing an infection without intrawound vancomycin (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.50, P = 0.0002, I2 = 47%). For combined superficial and deep infections the odds ratio was 0.43 (95% confidence interval 0.22-0.82, P = 0.01, I2 = 36%). Conclusions Numerous clinical studies have confirmed the safety of using vancomycin powder in the surgical site. The pooled clinical data supports the use of vancomycin to prevent SSIs in adult spine surgeries. The majority of the supporting literature is class III evidence. Existing studies use different definitions for surgical site infections and different pre-, peri-, and postoperative antibiotic regimens. Further high-quality investigations should use standardized protocols to confirm these findings. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL and CINAHL were searched in October 2013. PRISMA guidelines were followed. The quality of included studies was assessed by the Newcastle¡VOttawa scale (NOS). Sixteen eligible non-randomised studies were included. A total of 27,155 hand hygiene moments were observed. Meta-analysis using a random effects model indicated that a range of strategies, such as educational campaigns, musical parodies, reminders, easy access to hand hygiene sanitisers, UV sensors and performance feedback, improved HHC [odds ratio (OR) 2.04; 95?% confidence interval (CI) 1.40, 2.97]. Significant statistical heterogeneity was noted. Studies which specifically provided performance feedback at either the individual or group levels reported a more significant improvement in HHC compared to those that did not (OR 2.81; 95?% CI 1.32, 5.96 vs. OR 1.55; 95?% CI 1.13¡V2.11). Strategies to improve HHC in NICUs seem to be more effective when they include performance feedback at the personal or group levels. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) specifically assessing the benefits of performance feedback in improving HHC are needed. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

However, the incidence and risk factors for complications associated with anterior lumbar spine surgery (ALS) have not been fully elucidated. Purpose: To identify and document types of complications and complication rates associated with ALS, determine risk factors for these events, and evaluate the effect of measures used to decrease complication rates. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A systematic review of the English-language literature was conducted for articles published between January 1992 and December 2013. A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify articles reporting complications associated with ALS. For each complication, the data were combined using a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial probability distribution and a random effect based on the study. Predictors used were the type of procedure (open, minimally invasive, or laparoscopic), the approach used (transperitoneal vs. retroperitoneal), use of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2, use of preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA), and the utilization of an access surgeon. Open surgery was used as a reference category. Results: Seventy-six articles met final inclusion criteria and reported complication rates in 11,410 patients who underwent arthrodesis and/or arthroplasty via laparoscopic, mini-open, and open techniques. The overall complication rate was 14.1%, with intraoperative and postoperative complication rates of 9.1% and 5.2%, respectively. Only 3% of patients required reoperation or revision procedures. The most common complications reported were venous injury (3.2%), retrograde ejaculation (2.7%), neurologic injury (2%), prosthesis related (2%), postoperative ileus (1.4%), superficial infection (1%), and others (1.3%). Laparoscopic and transperitoneal procedures were associated with higher complication rates, whereas lower complication rates were observed in patients receiving mini-open techniques. Our analysis indicated that the use of recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 was associated with increased rates of retrograde ejaculation; however, there may be limitations in interpreting these data. Data regarding the use of preoperative CTA and an access surgeon were limited and demonstrated mixed benefit. Conclusions: Overall complication rates with ALS are relatively low, with the most common complications occurring at a rate of 1% to 3%. Complication rates are related to surgical technique, approach, and implant characteristics. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the use of preventative measures including CTA and the use of an access surgeon. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Most surveys have assessed the level of response to vaccine by measuring the titers of anti-HBs. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the Iranian published data on the rate of vaccine-responders versus non-responders. Moreover, the impact of variables such as age, gender, type of vaccine, etc. on the levels of responsiveness was evaluated. Evidence Acquisition: All published papers on this topic in Iranian and international journals with affiliation of ¡§Iran¡¨ were reviewed using standard Keywords up to 2014. We included our study to healthy participants with no previous HBV infection and who had already received a complete course of HB vaccine. The estimated prevalence and 95% confidence intervals in 28 eligible articles for HBV vaccine responders (anti-HBs > 10 IU/mL) and non-responders (10 <) were analyzed by random effect method due to between-study heterogeneity. Results: The age of subjects was between 6 months and 15 years old. Overall, 5991 (51.5%) were male and 4571 (48.5%) females. Overall, 80% were responders to vaccine versus 20% nonresponders. With increase in age, the number of responders to vaccine decreased significantly (P = 0.001). There was no strong difference between responders versus nonresponders to vaccine for gender, types of vaccine, ethnicity and living area. Conclusions: The results arose from this meta-analysis highlighted the safety of vaccine and its effectiveness in stimulating immune response of vaccines, despite being different in generation, manufacturers and types.

In the meta-analysis, the weighted mean differences (WMDs) in change scores for psychiatric symptoms were in favor of aripiprazole (-4.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 7.04 to -1.77) and risperidone (-1.48, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.61) compared to placebo. In cognitive effects, WMDs in change scores for the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C) were in favor of aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine and quetiapine which ranged from a -0.30 points mean difference (95% CI:-0.59 to -0.01) in the aripiprazole trials to -0.43 (95% CI:-0.62 to -0.25) in the risperidone group. Patients receiving atypical antipsychotics showed no difference in risk for injuries or falls (P?>?0.05), significantly higher risks (P?<?0.05) for somnolence, urinary tract infection, edema and abnormal gait. However, there was no significant evidence for death reported. Conclusion: Aripiprazole and risperidone are able to improve psychiatric symptoms and slow decline in cognition function at average 12 weeks in patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia. However, high adverse events may offset the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in dementia. ? 2015 Tan et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

HPV16/18 are the predominant oncogenic genotypes, causing approximately 70% of global cervical cancer cases. The vast majority of the women studied in previous analyses were from Europe, North America, Asia, and most recently Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite the high burden of cervical cancer morbidity and mortality in Africa, a robust meta-analysis of HPV genotype prevalence and distribution in African women is lacking. Methods and Findings: We systematically searched 14 major databases from inception to August 2013 without language restriction, following the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Seventy-one studies from 23 African countries were identified after screening 1162 citations and data abstracted and study quality appraised from 195 articles. HPV type-specific prevalence and distribution was estimated from 17,273 cases of women with normal cervical cytology; 1019 women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS); 1444 women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL); 1571 women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL); and 4,067 cases of invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). Overall prevalence of HPV16/18 were 4.4% and 2.8% of women with normal cytology, 12.0% and 4.4% with ASCUS, 14.5% and 10.0% with LSIL, 31.2% and 13.9% with HSIL, and 49.7% and 18.0% with ICC, respectively. Study limitations include the lack of adequate data from Middle and Northern African regions, and variations in the HPV type-specific sensitivity of different genotyping protocols. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive assessment of the overall prevalence and distribution of HPV genotypes in African women with and without different cervical neoplasias. We have established that HPV16/18 account for 67.7% of ICC cases among African women. Based on our findings, we highly recommend the administration of existing prophylactic vaccines to younger women not infected with HPV16/18 and an increase in HPV screening efforts for high-risk genotypes to prevent cervical cancer.

Preventing these infections has benefited from multidisciplinary infection control strategies and new antibiotics, but the problem persists. Probiotics are effective in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea and may also be a beneficial strategy for C. difficile infections, but randomized controlled trials are scarce. This meta-analysis pools 21 randomized, controlled trials for primary prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) and four trials for secondary prevention of C. difficile recurrences and assesses the efficacy of specific probiotic strains. Four probiotics significantly improved primary CDI prevention: (Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei DN114001, a mixture of L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum, and a mixture of L. acidophilus, L. casei and L. rhamnosus). None of the tested probiotics significantly improved secondary prevention of CDI. More confirmatory randomized trials are needed to establish if probiotics are useful for preventing C. difficile infections. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

To assess the magnitude of healthcareassociated TB (HCA-TB) transmission from HCWs to patients and colleagues, we searched three electronic databases up to February 2014 to select primary studies on HCA-TB incidents in which a HCW was the index case and possibly exposed patients and co-workers were screened.We identified 34 studies out of 2,714 citations. In 29 individual investigations, active TB was diagnosed in 3/6,080 (0.05%) infants, 18/3,167 (0.57%) children, 1/3,600 (0.03%) adult patients and 0/2,407 HCWs. The quantitative analysis of 28 individual reports showed that combined proportions of active TB among exposed individuals were: 0.11% (95% CI 0.04-0.21) for infants, 0.38% (95% CI 0.01-1.60) for children, 0.09% (95% CI 0.02-0.22) for adults and 0.00% (95% CI 0.00-0.38) for HCWs. Combined proportions of individuals who acquired TB infection were: 0.57% (95% CI 7.28E-03-2.02) for infants, 0.9% (95% CI 0.40-1.60) for children, 4.32% (95% CI 1.43-8.67) for adults and 2.62% (95% CI 1.05-4.88) for HCWs. The risk of TB transmission from HCWs appears to be lower than that recorded in other settings or in the healthcare setting when the index case is not a HCW. To provide a firm evidence base for the screening strategies, more and better information is needed on the infectivity of the source cases, the actual exposure level of screened contacts, and the environmental characteristics of the healthcare setting.

The objective of our systematic review and meta-analysis was to critically assess the efficacy of topical antibiotics in terms of preventing postsurgical wound infections in the dermatology outpatient setting. Methods: PubMed, Embase, MD Consult, Science Direct, Springer Link, DynaMed and Cochrane online medical databases were searched from 1980 to 2013. Results: Using random effects modeling, the pooled odds ratio of developing a postsurgical wound infection was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.42-1.19). Discussion: Pooled data of the four trials in the meta-analysis did not show a statistically significant difference in incidence of postsurgical wound infections between topical antibiotics and petrolatum/paraffin. In the setting of moist occlusive dressings, there is no statistically significant difference in prophylactic efficacy between applying and not applying ointment to surgical wounds. Wounds at increased risk of developing surgical site infections include wounds in diabetics, wounds located in certain anatomic regions, and wounds created by some surgical procedures. Conclusions: Petrolatum should be used instead of topical antibiotics as a prophylactic measure to prevent postsurgical wound infections in the outpatient dermatologic setting. ? 2014 Informa UK Ltd."

The authors argue that normal approximation does not always properly reflect the underlying uncertainty of the original discrete data. Furthermore, in the presence of rare events the results from this approximation can be very poor. This review proposes a Bayesian meta-analysis to address binary outcomes from sparse data and also introduces a simple way to examine the sensitivity of the quantities of interest in the meta-analysis with respect to the structure dependence selected. The findings suggest that for binary outcomes data it is possible to develop a Bayesian procedure, which can be directly applied to sparse data without ad hoc corrections. By choosing a suitable class of linking distributions, the authors found that a Bayesian robustness study can be easily implemented. For illustrative purposes, an example with real data is analyzed using the proposed Bayesian meta-analysis for binomial sparse data. ? 2015 Informa UK, Ltd."

Objective: To assess the effectiveness of wound edge protectors in open abdominal surgery in reducing surgical site infections. Evidence Review: A systematic literature search was conducted according to a prespecified review protocol in a variety of data-bases combined with hand-searches for randomized controlled trials on wound edge protectors in patients undergoing laparotomy. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of included trials was conducted. Findings: We identified 16 randomized controlled trials including 3695 patients investigating wound edge protectors published between 1972 and 2014. Critical appraisal uncovered a number of methodological flaws, predominantly in the older trials. Wound edge protectors significantly reduced the rate of surgical site infections (risk ratio 0.65; 95%CI, 0.51-0.83; p = 0.0007; I2 = 52%). The results were robust in a number of sensitivity analyses. A similar effect size was found in the subgroup of patients undergoing colorectal surgery (risk ratio 0.65; 95%CI, 0.44-0.97; p = 0.04; I2 = 56%). Of the two common types of wound protectors double ring devices were found to exhibit a greater protective effect (risk ratio 0.29; 95%CI, 0.15-0.55) than single-ring devices (risk ratio 0.71; 95%CI, 0.54-0.92), but this might largely be due to the lower quality of available data for double-ring devices. Exploratory subgroup analyses for the degree of contamination showed a larger protective effect in contaminated cases (0.44; 95%CI, 0.28-0.67; p = 0.0002, I2 = 23%) than in clean-contaminated surgeries (0.72, 95%CI, 0.57-0.91; p = 0.005; I2 = 46%) and a strong effect on the reduction of superficial surgical site infections (risk ratio 0.45; 95%CI, 0.24-0.82; p = 0.001; I2 = 72%).

However, their utility depends upon the overall performance of individual tests. Methods: A literature search was conducted using the metasearch engine Metta¡Â, a query interface for retrieving articles from five leading medical databases. Studies were included if they employed point-of-care tests to detect antibodies of hepatitis C virus and compared the results with reference tests. Two reviewers performed a quality assessment of the studies and extracted data for estimating test accuracy. Findings:Thirty studies that had evaluated 30 tests fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The overall pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood-ratio, negative likelihood-ratio and diagnostic odds ratio for all tests were 97.4% (95% CI: 95.9-98.4), 99.5% (99.2-99.7), 80.17 (55.35-116.14), 0.03 (0.02-0.04), and 3032.85 (1595.86 - 5763.78), respectively. This suggested a high pooled accuracy for all studies. We found substantial heterogeneity between studies, but none of the subgroups investigated could account for the heterogeneity. Genotype diversity of HCV had no or minimal influence on test performance. Of the seven tests evaluated in the meta-regression model, OraQuick had the highest test sensitivity and specificity and showed better performance than a third generation enzyme immunoassay in seroconversion panels. The next highest test sensitivities and specificities were from TriDot and SDBioline, followed by Genedia and Chembio. The Spot and Multiplo tests produced poor test sensitivities but high test specificities. Nine of the remaining 23 tests produced poor test sensitivities and specificities and/or showed poor performances in seroconversion panels, while 14 tests had high test performances with diagnostic odds ratios ranging from 590.70 to 28822.20. Conclusions:Performances varied widely among individual point-of-care tests for diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection.

Restrictive compared with liberal transfusion strategies were not associated with risk of death (0.86, 0.74 to 1.01, 5707 patients, nine lower risk of bias trials), overall morbidity (0.98, 0.85 to 1.12, 4517 patients, six lower risk of bias trials), or fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction (1.28, 0.66 to 2.49, 4730 patients, seven lower risk of bias trials). Results were not affected by the inclusion of trials with unclear or high risk of bias. Using trial sequential analyses on mortality and myocardial infarction, the required information size was not reached, but a 15% relative risk reduction or increase in overall morbidity with restrictive transfusion strategies could be excluded. Conclusions Compared with liberal strategies, restrictive transfusion strategies were associated with a reduction in the number of red blood cell units transfused and number of patients being transfused, but mortality, overall morbidity, and myocardial infarction seemed to be unaltered. Restrictive transfusion strategies are safe in most clinical settings. Liberal transfusion strategies have not been shown to convey any benefit to patients. ? BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2015."

Studies that investigated the comparing effectiveness or complications between both groups and provided sufficient data of interest were included in this meta-analysis. Results: Thirteen studies fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis, which included 479 participants in PF group and 457 in IF group. Compared to PFs, IFs outperformed PFs associated with a reduced surgery time, a shorter incision, rapid union time, better shoulder function recovery at 6months and fewer complications of symptomatic hardware, refracture after hardware removal and hypertrophic scar. In other aspects such as functional recovery at 12months and 24months follow-up, shoulder motion range, complications of superficial infection,temporary brachial plexus lesion, nonunion, malunion, delayed union, implant failure, major revision needed, both techniques were comparable.

Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality, and Stata 11.0 was used to analyze data.Results: The main factors associated with infection after spinal surgery were idiopathic scoliosis (OR, 0.303; 95?% CI, 0.202¡V0.453), neuromuscular scoliosis (OR, 2.269; 95?% CI, 1.576¡V3.267), ambulatory status (OR, 0.241; 95?% CI, 0.078¡V0.747), previous spinal surgery (OR, 4.564; 95?% CI, 1.892¡V11.009), sacral vertebrae fused (OR, 2.717; 95?% CI, 1.836¡V4.020), and allograft (OR, 8.498; 95?% CI, 4.030¡V17.917). There was no sufficient evidence to reveal that male gender, age, body mass index, preoperative curve, preoperative urinary tract infection, combined anterior-posterior approach, estimated blood loss, and operating room time could lead to infection after spinal surgery.Conclusions: We identified some risk factors which could be used to prevent the onset of surgical site infection in pediatric spinal deformity surgery. However, the results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity among the studies. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

HAP emissions are an established lung carcinogen; however, associations with other cancer sites have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies. Using fixed-effects models, utilizing the adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) from each study, we evaluated the association between HAP and cervical neoplasia (663 cases and 1747 controls) and upper aero-digestive tract cancers (6022 cases and 15 325 controls). We found that HAP was associated with cervical neoplasia (OR = 6.46; 95% CI = 3.12-13.36; 4 studies); oral (OR = 2.44; 95% CI = 1.87-3.19; 4 studies; 1000 cases/3450 controls); nasopharyngeal (OR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.4 2-2.29; 6 studies; 2231 cases/2160 controls); pharyngeal (OR = 3.56; 95% CI = 2.22-5.70; 4 studies; 1036 cases/3746 controls); and laryngeal (OR = 2.35; 95% CI = 1.72- 3.21; 5 studies; 1416 cases/4514 controls) cancers. The elevated risk for esophageal cancer (OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 0.82-4.49; 2 studies; 339 cases/1455 controls) was non-significant. HAP was associated with cervical neoplasia among studies that accounted for HPV infection (OR = 9.60; 95% CI = 3.79-24.32) and smoking (OR = 4.72; 95% CI = 1.84-12.07). Similarly, our observed associations between HAP and upper aero-digestive tract cancers remained significantly elevated when analyses were restricted to studies that controlled for smoking. No significant publication bias was detected. Our results suggest that the carcinogenic effect of HAP observed for lung cancer may extend to other cancers, including those of the cervix and the upper aero-digestive tract. Further research is needed to confirm these associations in prospective studies. ? 2015 Josyula et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

Studies with fewer than 50 participants or of less than 12 weeks' duration were excluded. Data synthesis Two investigators independently searched both databases. All authors reviewed selected studies. We compared relative risk differences using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects method to assess total respiratory adverse events, infectious respiratory adverse events, non-infectious respiratory adverse events, interstitial lung disease, and death.

However, it is unclear whether oneor two-stage BB-AVF is the best option for patients. Aim: To systematically assess the difference between both procedures in terms of access maturation, patency and postoperative complications. Methods: Online search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared the one-stage versus the two-stage technique for creating a BB-AVF. Results: Eight studies were included (849 patients with 859 fistulas), 366 created using a one-stage technique, while 493 in a two-stage approach. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the rate of successful maturation (Pooled risk ratio = 0.95 [0.82, 1.11], P = 0.53). Similarly, the incidence of postoperative haematoma (Pooled risk ratio = 0.73 [0.34, 1.58], P = 0.43), wound infection (Pooled risk ratio = 0.77 [0.35, 1.68], P = 0.51) and steal syndrome (Pooled risk ratio = 0.65 [0.27, 1.53], P = 0.32) were statistically comparable. Conclusion: Although more studies seem to favour the two-stage BVT approach, evidence in the literature is not sufficient to draw a final conclusion as the difference between the one-stage and the two-stage approaches for creation of a BB-AVF is not statistically significant in terms of the overall maturation rate and postoperative complications. Patency rates (primary, assisted primary and secondary) were comparable in the majority of studies. Large randomised properly conducted trials with superior methodology and adequate sub-group analysis are needed before making a final recommendation. ? 2015 Bashar et al."

The risk for recurrences and complications relates not only to the presence of viruses but also to immune function. Therefore, modulation of the immune system and antiviral interventions such as echinacea might reduce the risk of recurrences and possibly the development of complications.Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CAplus, BIOSIS, CABA, AGRICOLA, TOXCENTER, SCISEARCH, NAHL, and NAPRALERT were searched for clinical trials that studied recurrent respiratory infections and complications on treatment with echinacea extracts in a generally healthy population. Two independent reviewers selected randomized, placebo-controlled studies of high methodological quality and a Jadad score of ?4. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated according to a fixed effect model.Results: Six clinical studies with a total of 2458 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Use of echinacea extracts was associated with reduced risk of recurrent respiratory infections (RR 0.649, 95% CI 0.545¡V0.774; P?<?0.0001). Ethanolic extracts from echinacea appeared to provide superior effects over pressed juices, and increased dosing during acute episodes further enhanced these effects. Three independent studies found that in individuals with higher susceptibility, stress or a state of immunological weakness, echinacea halved the risk of recurrent respiratory infections (RR 0.501, 95% CI 0.380¡V0.661; P?<?0.0001). Similar preventive effects were observed with virologically confirmed recurrent infections (RR 0.420, 95% CI 0.222¡V0.796; P?=?0.005). Complications including pneumonia, otitis media/externa, and tonsillitis/pharyngitis were also less frequent with echinacea treatment (RR 0.503, 95% CI 0.384¡V0.658; P?<?0.0001).Conclusion: Evidence indicates that echinacea potently lowers the risk of recurrent respiratory infections and complications thereof. Immune modulatory, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory effects might contribute to the observed clinical benefits, which appear strongest in susceptible individuals. ? 2015, Springer Healthcare."

Methods Systematic literature review with a meta-Analysis of clinical trials comparing glimepiride with any iDPP4, both used together with metformin as a second line treatment of DM2. The effectiveness variables used were as follows: %HbA1c variation, fasting plasma glucose variation, patients achieving the therapeutic objective of HbA1c <7%, treatment dropouts due to lack of effectiveness and rescue treatments needed. The safety variables included were as follows: weight variation at the end of treatment; presentation of any type of adverse event; presentation of serious adverse events; patients who experienced any type of hypoglycaemia; patients who experienced severe hypoglycaemia; treatments suspended due to adverse effects; and deaths for any reason. Results Four studies met the inclusion criteria. The group treated with glimepiride showed better results in all effectiveness variables. Regarding safety variables, the main differences observed were in the greater number of cases with hypoglycaemia in the group treated with glimepiride, and the serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations due to these which occurred in slightly over 2% more cases in this group compared to the iDPP4 group. The remaining adverse events, including mortality, did not show any differences between both groups. The variation in the weight difference between groups (2.1 kg) is not considered clinically relevant. Conclusions A greater effectiveness is seen in the glimepiride/metformin association, which should not be diminished by slight differences in adverse effects, with absence of severe hypoglycaemia in over 98% of patients under treatment. The association of glimepiride/metformin, both due to cost as well as effectiveness and safety, may be the preferential treatment for most DM2 patients, and it offers a potential advantage in refractory hyperglycemic populations, tolerant to treatment. ? 2015 The Authors.

We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate whether HPV infection in lung tissue is associated with LC compared with non-cancer controls. We also quantified this association in different LC subtypes. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched through March 2014, using the search terms ""lung cancer"", ""human papillomavirus"", ""HPV"" and their combinations. Association was tested using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Heterogeneity was assessed using Q and I2 statistic. Finally, nine studies, for a total of 1094 LCs and 484 non-cancer controls, were identified as eligible publications. The pooled results showed that HPV infection was associated with LC (OR=5.67, 95% CI: 3.09-10.40, P&lt;0.001). Similar results were also observed in HPV16 and/or HPV18 (HPV16/18) infection analyses (OR=6.02, 95% CI: 3.22-11.28, P&lt;0.001).

Methods We systematically reviewed population-based cross-sectional studies that estimated chlamydia prevalence in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) Member States and non-European high income countries from January 1990 to August 2012. We examined results in forest plots, explored heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, and conducted random effects meta-analysis if appropriate. Meta-regression was used to examine the relationship between study characteristics and chlamydia prevalence estimates. Results We included 25 population-based studies from 11 EU/EEA countries and 14 studies from five other high income countries. Four EU/EEAMember States reported on nationally representative surveys of sexually experienced adults aged 18-26 years (response rates 52-71%). In women, chlamydia point prevalence estimates ranged from3.0-5.3%; the pooled average of these estimates was 3.6%(95%CI 2.4, 4.8, I2 0%). In men, estimates ranged from 2.4-7.3% (pooled average 3.5%; 95%CI 1.9, 5.2, I2,&gt; 27%). Estimates in EU/EEA Member States were statistically consistent with those in other high income countries (I2 0% for women, 6%for men). There was statistical evidence of an association between survey response rate and estimated chlamydia prevalence; estimates were higher in surveys with lower response rates, (p = 0.003 in women, 0.018 inmen). Conclusions Population-based surveys that estimate chlamydia prevalence are at risk of participation bias owing to low response rates.

This systematicreview aimed to estimate proportions of S. aureus and MRSA in SSIs through available published studies. Methods: PubMed, Embase and four Chinese electronic databases were searched to identify relevant primary studies published between 2007 and 2012. Meta-analysis was conducted on the basis of logit-transformed metric for proportions of S. aureus and MRSA, followed by predefined subgroup meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-regression was also conducted to explore the impact of possible factors on S. aureus proportions. Results: 106 studies were included, of which 38 studies involved MRSA. S. aureus accounted for 19.1% (95%CI 17.2-21.0%; I<inf>2</inf> = 84.1%) of all isolates in SSIs, which was roughly parallel to 18.5% in the United States (US) (P-value = 0.57) but significantly exceeded those calculated through the surveillance system in China (P-value<0.001). In subgroup analysis, S. aureus in patients with thoracic surgery (41.1%, 95%CI 26.3-57.7%; I<inf>2</inf> = 74.4%) was more common than in those with gynecologic surgery (20.1%, 95%CI 15.6-25.6%; I<inf>2</inf> = 33.0%) or abdominal surgery (13.8%, 95%CI 10.3-18.4%; I<inf>2</inf> = 70.0%). Similar results were found in metaregression. MRSA accounted for 41.3% (95%CI 36.5-46.3%; I<inf>2</inf> = 64.6%) of S. aureus, significantly lower than that in the US (P-value = 0.001). MRSA was sensitive to vancomycin (522/522) and linezolid (93/94), while 79.9%(95%CI 67.4-88.4%; I<inf>2</inf>= 0%) and 92.0% (95%CI 80.2-97.0%; I<inf>2</inf>= 0%) of MRSA was resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin respectively. Conclusion: The overall proportion of S. aureus among SSIs in China was similar to that in the US but seemed higher than those reported through the Chinese national surveillance system. Proportions of S. aureus SSIs may vary with different surgery types. Commonly seen in SSIs, MRSA tended to be highly sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid but mostly resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. ? 2015 Yang et al."

A meta-analysis for each outcome (overall and infectious morbidity and length of stay) of interest was carried out. The effect size was estimated by the risk ratio (RR) or by the weighted mean difference (WMD). Nineteen RCTs were identified with a total of 1243 patients (640 receiving GLN and 603 controls). In general, the studies were underpowered and of medium or low quality. GLN supplementation did not affect overall morbidity (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.36; p = 0.473) and infectious morbidity (RR = 0.64; 95% CI = 0.38 to 1.07; p = 0.087). Patients treated with glutamine had a significant reduction in length of hospital stay (WMD = ?2.67; 95% CI = ?3.83 to ?1.50; p < 0.0001).

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published estimates of the asymptomatic fraction of influenza virus infections. We found that estimates of the asymptomatic fraction were reported from two different types of studies: first, outbreak investigations with short-term follow-up of potentially exposed persons and virologic confirmation of infections; second, studies conducted across epidemics typically evaluating rates of acute respiratory illness among persons with serologic evidence of infection, in some cases adjusting for background rates of illness from other causes. Results: Most point estimates from studies of outbreak investigations fell in the range 4%-28% with low heterogeneity (I2 = 0%) with a pooled mean of 16% (95% confidence interval = 13%, 19%). Estimates from the studies conducted across epidemics without adjustment were very heterogeneous (point estimates 0%-100%; I2 = 97%), while estimates from studies that adjusted for background illnesses were more consistent with point estimates in the range 65%-85% and moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 58%). Variation in estimates could be partially explained by differences in study design and analysis, and inclusion of mild symptomatic illnesses as asymptomatic in some studies. Conclusions: Estimates of the asymptomatic fraction are affected by the study design, and the definitions of infection and symptomatic illness. Considerable differences between the asymptomatic fraction of infections confirmed by virologic versus serologic testing may indicate fundamental differences in the interpretation of these two indicators.

Online and manual searches were performed using Medline, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Cochrane Central Database from January 1980 to March 2014). For inclusion, studies had to meet the quality assessment criteria of the CONSORT statement, and be concerned with evaluation of risk factors for PJI after TJA. Two reviewers extracted the relevant data independently and any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Fourteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The following significant risk factors for PJI were identified: body mass index (both continuous and dichotomous variables); diabetes mellitus; corticosteroid therapy; hypoalbuminaemia; history of rheumatoid arthritis; blood transfusion; presence of a wound drain; wound dehiscence; superficial surgical site infection; coagulopathy; malignancy, immunodepression; National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Score ?2; other nosocomial infection; prolonged operative time; and previous surgery. Factors that were not significantly associated with PJI were: cirrhosis; hypothyroidism; urinary tract infection; illicit drug abuse; alcohol abuse; hypercholesterolaemia; hypertension, ischaemic heart disease; peptic ulcer disease; hemiplegia or paraplegia; dementia; and operation performed by a staff surgeon (vs a trainee).

It is not yet clear whether these drugs increase an infection risk or not. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of infections associated with anti-HER2 mAbs. We searched PubMed and the ASCO online database of meeting abstracts up to January 2014 for relevant clinical trials. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of trastuzumab or pertuzumab for breast cancer patients that reported adequate safety data for grade 3¡V4 infection, febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, or leukopenia. The summary incidence, relative risk (RR), and 95?% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A total of 10,094 patients from 13 trials were included. The use of trastuzumab was associated with an increased risk of high-grade infection (RR 1.21, 95?% CI 1.07¡V1.37, P?=?0.002) and febrile neutropenia (RR 1.28, 95?% CI 1.08¡V1.52, P?=?0.004).

We searched the references on the association between HAdV-36 infection and obesity with the different epidemiological methods, to explore the relationship with a larger sample size by meta-Analysis and compare the differences of epidemiological methods and population subsets by the subgroup analyses. We conducted literature search on the association between HAdV-36 infections and obesity in English or Chinese published up to July 1, 2015. The primary outcome was the HAdV-36 infection rate in the obese and lean groups; the secondary outcomes were the BMI level and BMI z-score in the HAdV-36 positive and negative groups. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated for the primary outcome; the standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for the secondary and third outcomes. Prediction interval (PI) was graphically presented in the forest plot of the random effect meta-Analyses. Metaregression analysis and subgroup analysis were performed.

Multi-transfused patients are known as ¡¥at-risk¡¦ group for the infection due to frequent blood transfusions. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to review the HTLV-1 infection prevalence among Iranian multi-transfused patients. Materials and Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, ISI, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, IMEMR, IranMedex, Magiran, IranDoc, ISNet, RICeST and SID as well as grey literatures in both English and Persian were searched up to December 2013 and the related studies were critically appraised. Data were analyzed with R software version 3.1.2. Results: A total of 551 non-duplicate and non-overlapping citations were found in the primary search, of which 18 surveyed HTLV-1 infection prevalence among Iranian multi-transfused patients. Six non-duplicate and nonoverlapping studies were added from grey literature search. Out of these sixteen studies conducted among 3922 patients from 14 provinces met the inclusion criteria. The HTLV-1 infection prevalence varied considerably and the highest prevalence (14.4%) was reported among hemodialysis patients from Neyshabur, northeastern Iran. Overall estimation of HTLV-I prevalence was 3.2% (95%CI: 2.2-4.8). The HTLV-1 infection prevalence among patients with thalassemia and hemodialysis were 4.1% (95%CI: 3.4-4.9) and 2.9% (95%CI: 0.96-8.3), respectively. Conclusion: HTLV-1 infection prevalence among patients with frequent transfusions in Iran varies greatly in different parts of the country, but it is endemic in nearly all provinces.

Methods By meta-analysis, 12 eligible studies involving 8,509 cases and 247,285 controls were identified via PubMed and Embase. Results CDI patients had a higher risk of hospital mortality than non-CDI patients (odds ratio [OR], 1.899; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.269-2.840), especially in 30-day mortality (OR, 2.521; 95% CI, 1.800-3.531). No correlation was found between hospital CDI and Charlson comorbidity index (OR, 0.830; 95% CI, 0.559-1.231). Patients treated in the ICU have an increased risk of hospital CDI (OR, 1.820; 95% CI, 1.161-2.851). However, the risk of CDI in patients who used to have surgery in surgical wards was not different to patients in the other departments (OR, 1.054; 95% CI, 0.838-1.325). Moreover, CDI patients in studies from the most recent 5 years have a higher risk of hospital mortality (OR, 2.171; 95% CI, 1.426-3.304). Conclusion Hospital CDI was associated with an increased risk of hospital mortality, especially in 30-day mortality. In addition, when compared with past years, CDI patients have a higher risk of hospital mortality in the most recent 5 years. Given the rapid dissemination of this organism worldwide, there is a need to aggressively develop and evaluate primary preventive strategies targeting CDI among hospitalized patients, especially in ICUs. ? 2015 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

Material and methods: The relevant studies were identified through a search of public databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to December 2012. A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the clinical response, mortality and renal damage of colistin (colistin group) versus other effective antibiotics (control group). The odds ratio (OR) was chosen as the effect size. Results: A total of 9 studies were eventually identified. The result of the meta-analysis showed that the pooled OR of clinical response was 1.24 (95% CI = 0.68-2.27, p > 0.05) for patients in the colistin group versus the control group, indicating no significant difference in efficacy between colistin and control groups. Similar results were obtained by the further subgroup meta-analyses by sample size, research year, ethnicity and study method. Treatment with colistin versus other agents did not affect hospital mortality (OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.58-1.89, p > 0.05) or renal damage (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.78-2.00, p > 0.05).

BV is highly prevalent and associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including enhanced human immunodeficiency virus transmission. Because recent reports reveal that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection may increase BV risk, we initiated a systematic review and meta-analysis of the link between HSV-2 infection and BV. Methods. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases to identify articles posted before 1 December 2014. Two screeners independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all identified articles, reviewed the full text of articles deemed potentially eligible, and extracted data from 14 cross-sectional and 3 prospective studies. Using random-effects models, we computed separate pooled estimates for cross-sectional and prospective studies. Results. The pooled odds ratio for cross-sectional studies was 1.60 (95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.94). Stronger support for the causal effect of HSV-2 infection on BV risk was revealed by the summary relative risk for the prospective studies, which was 1.55 (95% confidence interval, 1.30-1.84), with minimal heterogeneity (I2 = 0).

Given that influenza A(H9N2) is recognized as a pandemic threat, we evaluated the overall burden of influenza A(H9N2) infections among avian-exposed human populations. Methods. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, AGRICOLA, and CAB Abstracts databases for literature published during 1997-2013. Studies reporting serological evidence of human influenza A(H9N2) infection among avian-exposed populations were included. We used a World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended case definition for serological evidence of infection based on results of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays. We calculated overall seroprevalence through a random effects meta-analysis model. Results. Seroprevalence data reported by the studies ranged from 1% to 43% (median, 9%) by HI, which was not significantly different from the seroprevalence estimated through the WHO-recommended case definition (median, 1.3%; range, 0.5%-42.6%). Reported seroprevalence by MN ranged from 0.6% to 9% (median, 2.7%), which was greater than the seroprevalence estimated through the WHO-recommended case definition (median, 0.3%; range, 0.1%-1.4%). Conclusions. A small proportion of avian-exposed humans had evidence of influenza A(H9N2) infection. As the virus has a near global distribution in poultry, it seems likely that present surveillance efforts are missing mild or asymptomatic infections among avian-exposed persons. It seems prudent to closely monitor avian-exposed populations for influenza A(H9N2) infection to provide prepandemic warnings. ? 2015 The Author."

Its value has been questioned over the last decade owing to well acknowledged limitations in efficacy and tolerability and the emergence of newer meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)-active antibacterial agents. However, no single agent has shown better results versus vancomycin in SSTI trials. The aim of this review was to identify and summarise data from meta-analyses (MAs) for the treatment of Gram-positive and MRSA SSTIs. A systematic search identified 21 published MAs examining the use of newer antibiotics and vancomycin in SSTIs. In terms of clinical and microbiological efficacy, linezolid (in Gram-positive and MRSA SSTIs) and telavancin (in MRSA SSTIs) were shown to be more effective than vancomycin. The safety of newer antimicrobials in general was comparable with vancomycin, except for telavancin, which was associated with more severe adverse events (AEs), and tigecycline owing to an all-cause mortality imbalance observed in all infections but not confirmed in SSTIs. Specific AEs were related to the use of newer agents, such as nephrotoxicity for telavancin, creatine phosphokinase elevations for daptomycin, and thrombocytopenia with linezolid. Some evidence suggests that daptomycin could be associated with reduced treatment duration, and linezolid with reduced length of intravenous treatment and hospital length of stay compared with vancomycin. Considering the limitations of this type of research and the comparative efficacy results demonstrated in head-to-head randomised controlled trials, data are still not sufficient to support the widespread use of new agents over vancomycin. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

In addition, subgroup analysis was performed based on the study locations and previous circulating influenza viruses. Relevant articles in English and Chinese from 2009 to October 2013 were systematically searched, and 21 eligible studies were included. For case-control studies, an insignificant 20% reduced risk for pandemic influenza infection based on combined national data (OR = 0.80; 95%CI: 0.60, 1.05) was calculated for people receiving seasonal influenza vaccination. However, for RCTs, an insignificant increase in the risk of seasonal influenza vaccines was observed (RR = 1.27; 95% CI: 0.46, 3.53). For the subgroup analysis, a significant 35% cross-protection was observed in the subgroup where influenza A outbreaks were detected before the 2009 pandemic. Moreover, the results indicated that seasonal influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.99). Our findings partially support the hypothesis that seasonal vaccines may offer moderate cross-protection for adults against laboratory-confirmed pandemic influenza A (H1N1) infection and ILIs. Further immunological studies are needed to understand the mechanism underlying these findings. ? 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Nevertheless, the association between carriage of toxinogenic strains and ensuing C. difficile infections (CDIs) has not been studied.Methods:We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases up to 20 June 2014, using the term ""difficile"". Our primary outcomes of interest included the prevalence of isolation of toxinogenic C. difficile or its toxins from asymptomatic patients on hospital admission through stool or rectal swab testing and the risk of ensuing infection among colonized and noncolonized patients. Data on previous hospitalization, antibiotic, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use and prior CDIs among colonized and noncolonized patients were also extracted.Results:Nineteen out of 26,081 studies on 8,725 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of toxinogenic C. difficile colonization was 8.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-11.1%), with an increasing trend over time (P=0.003), and 10.0% (95% CI 7.1-13.4%) among North American studies. Patients colonized upon hospital admission had a 5.9 times higher risk of subsequent CDIs compared with noncolonized patients (relative risk (RR) 5.86; 95% CI 4.21-8.16). The risk of CDI for colonized patients was 21.8% (95% CI 7.9-40.1%), which was significantly higher than that of noncolonized patients (3.4%; 95% CI 1.5-6.0%; P=0.03), with an attributable risk of 18.4%. History of hospitalization during the previous 3 months was associated with a higher risk of colonization (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.13-2.34), as opposed to previous antibiotic (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.75-1.53) and PPI use (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.94-2.23), as well as history of CDI (RR 1.45; 95% CI 0.66-3.18) that had no impact.Conclusions:Over 8% of admitted patients are carriers of toxinogenic C. difficile with an almost 6 times higher risk of infection.

Understanding the causes of chronic tonsillitis is important in clinical decision making of this commonly treated disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation between H pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in chronic tonsillitis and in noninfectious hyperplastic tonsils. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Trial Registry (through June 2014) and relevant article bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing the correlation between H pylori colonization in tonsillar tissues of patients undergoing tonsillectomy for either chronic tonsillitis or noninfectious causes. Included studies hypothesized that H pylori played a role in the development of chronic tonsillitis. All included studies investigated the presence of H pylori in tonsillar tissue removed for various indications. Included studies must have used an accepted method of testing for H pylori. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Studieswere systematically reviewed by 2 independent reviewers for inclusion. Reported results of H pylori testing between tissues removed for infectious or noninfectious causes were systematically reviewed. The odds ratio of H pylori colonization in tissue removed for chronic tonsillitis compared with tissue removed for noninfectious causes was calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Six studiesmet inclusion criteria and had suitable data for pooling (n = 436). Of these, 2 studies measured H pylori colonization of tonsillar tissue in pediatric populations. One study analyzed tissue in both adult and pediatric populations. Noninfectious indications for tonsillectomy included sleep apnea or sleep-related breathing disorder, obstruction, carcinoma, and tonsillar hypertrophy. Overall, tonsillar H pylori colonization was found not to be significantly present more often in tissue samples removed secondary to recurrent infection rather than to noninfectious indications. The odds ratio of H pylori colonization in the tonsils of patients with chronic tonsillitis was 1.993 (95%CI, 0.909-4.371) (P = .09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Helicobacter pylori colonization was not found to be more prevalent on tonsillar tissue with chronic or recurrent infections. The reviewed studies provide no evidence that H pylori infection plays a role in the pathogenesis or development of chronic tonsillitis. Copyright 2015 American Medical Association.

There are several tests available to determine the presence of latent tuberculosis infection: the tuberculin skin test (TST), QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G), and T-SPOT.TB. The objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these tests in determining latent tuberculosis infection in the hemodialysis population. Methods The study design was a systematic review. We selected studies with adequate information to ascertain test sensitivity or specificity of the TST, QFT-G, and TSPOT.TB with regards to determining latent tuberculosis infection in the hemodialysis population. Results One hundred two articles were selected for full review, and 17 were included in the meta-analysis. The TST had a pooled sensitivity of 31% (26%-36%, 95% confidence interval) and specificity of 63% (60%-65%) across eight studies. The QFT-G test had a pooled sensitivity of 53% (46%-59%) and specificity of 69% (65%-72%) across nine studies. The T-SPOT.TB test had a pooled sensitivity of 50% (42%-59%) and specificity of 67% (61%-73%) across three studies. Conclusion The QFT-G and the T-SPOT.TB tests were more sensitive than the TST for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in patients on hemodialysis while offering a comparable level of specificity. This systematic review calls into question the practice of using the TST to screen in this population, especially in patients considered for kidney transplantation. ?

However, data reporting the benefit of this technique in the elderly is very conflicting. Method: We performed a systematic review of available literature (till November 2014) using multiple databases to identify studies comparing clinical events in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting using either a single or double internal thoracic artery in the elderly. While early mortality was the primary end-point of inclusion, other adverse events compared were sternal wound infection (deep and superficial), stroke and peri-operative myocardial infarction. Individual and pooled odd's ratios were calculated using the Mantel-Haenzel method (random effect model); sensitivity analysis was performed. Results are presented using 95% confidence intervals. Result: Nine retrospective studies (4479 BITA, 7733 LITA patients) fulfilled search criteria. Deep sternal wound infection was significantly higher after BITA harvest [OR 1.86 (1.3-2.5); I2=0%; p<0.01]. Early mortality (BITA 3.6% vs SITA 3.1%; p=0.86), stroke [OR 0.7(0.4-1.1); p=0.1], and peri-operative myocardial infarction (BITA 4.3% vs SITA 2.3%; p=0.1) were comparable in both cohorts. Long-term survival favored the BITA cohort in two propensity matched studies. Conclusion: The incidence of deep sternal wound infection may be significantly higher after the harvest of both internal thoracic arteries in the elderly. While other post-operative adverse events are comparable, data regarding the long-term survival advantage in this cohort is conflicting. Hence, the use of both internal thoracic arteries in this age group needs to be invidualized. ? 2015 IJS Publishing Group Limited."

Methods: Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.2. The pooled risk ratio was estimated with random-effect model. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library, reference lists and conference proceedings were data sources. Two independent reviewers screened studies for inclusion and data extraction. Eligible trials were RCTs enrolling patients accepting laparotomies to assess the effectiveness of WEP. Results: Eleven RCTs totalling 2344 patients met the inclusion criteria. Six trials (1589 patients) testing the single-ring design WEP did not show a statistically significant reduction in SSI of laparotomy (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.12). Pooled analysis of the five trials (755 patients) that tested the effect of dual-ring design WEP on SSI showed a significant reduction (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.15-0.55). The combined data of the 11 trials favoured the effect of WEP (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.39-0.87). Analysis adjusted by the degrees of contamination revealed that WEP is effective in reducing the incidence of SSI after laparotomy of contamination incision (RR 0.43, 0.26-0.72) but failed to demonstrate such effect in clean/contaminated and dirty incisions (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.21; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43-1.55, respectively). Conclusions: Our exploratory meta-analysis suggests that WEP reduces the incidence of SSI in patients receiving laparotomies, especially in the circumstance of dual-ring WEP and in contaminated incisions. In order to fully assess the effectiveness of WEP, large-scale and well-designed RCTs are still needed in the future. ? 2015 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons."

Aim: To test whether aseptic preparation of parenteral doses or additives to sterile doses undertaken in dedicated pharmaceutical rather than clinical environments reduces the risk of microbial dose contamination. Methods: Data identified from a systematic review were examined using random effects meta-analyses, and t-tests were used to compare dose contamination frequencies. Findings: In all, 16,552 doses from 34 studies (33 records) were identified. For all the data combined there was a significantly higher frequency of contamination of doses prepared in clinical than in pharmaceutical environments (3.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.2, 6.2; N = 10,272 doses] vs 0.5% (95% CI: 0.1, 1.6; N = 6280 doses); P = 0.007). Contamination of doses was significantly higher when prepared as individual lots than as part of a batch in pharmaceutical environments [2.1% (95% CI: 0.7, 5.8; N = 168 doses) vs 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1, 0.9; N = 6112 doses); P = 0.002].

The overall quality of the studies was judged to be low. Conclusion: Reported rates of parenteral dose contamination were orders of magnitude higher than accepted reference standards, which may increase infection risk.

Immediate implementation of infection control measures is crucial. The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for sources and modes of introduction of norovirus, and factors contributing to spread. A systematic review of the literature was performed, including peer-reviewed original studies on outbreaks confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Data on source, index case, transmission mode, attack rate, outbreak duration, and risk factors were extracted. Attack rate and outbreak duration were compared by mode of introduction. Based on the selection criteria, 40 outbreak reports and 18 surveillance studies were included. There is little systematic information available on norovirus introduction into nursing homes, but, from evidence obtained from outbreak reports, it was determined that outbreaks often start with single index cases (57.5%), associated with higher attack rates among residents (. P=0.02). Foodborne introduction was described for 7% of outbreak reports that were characterized by finding multiple index cases. In surveillance studies only 0.7% of outbreaks was reported to be foodborne, 28.5% as person-to-person, and 70.8% remained unknown or not mentioned. Risk factor analyses suggested that transmission was associated with bedside care and exposure to vomit. These findings lead to the following recommendations: (i) to standardize outbreak reports; (ii) to improve early detection and isolation of sporadic cases; (iii) to improve personal hygiene of staff especially with highly dependent residents; and (iv) to comply with protocols to avoid exposure to vomit. ? 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society."

Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM - OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 109 CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections. ? 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH."

In Nigeria, HBV is reported to be the most common cause of liver disease. However, the extent of HBV exposure among Nigerians at average risk is unknown. Our aim, therefore, was to accurately estimate the HBV prevalence for the country and the prevalence for specific subgroups. We used electronic databases to select systematic reviews and meta-analyses from 2000 to 2013. Forty-six studies were included (n = 34,376 persons). We used a random effects meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to generate our estimates. The pooled prevalence of HBV in Nigeria was 13.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.5, 15.7%). The pooled prevalence (% [95% CI]) among subgroups was: 14.0% (11.7, 16.3) for blood donors; 14.1% (9.6, 18.6) for pregnant women attending antenatal clinics; 11.5% (6.0, 17.0) for children; 14.0% (11.6, 16.5) among adults; and 16.0% (11.1, 20.9) for studies evaluating adults and children. HBV prevalence in Nigeria varied by screening method [% (95% CI)]: 12.3% (10.1, 14.4) by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 17.5% (12.4, 22.7) by immunochromatography; and 13.6% (11.5, 15.7) by HBV DNA polymerase chain reaction. HBV infection is hyperendemic in Nigeria and may be the highest in Sub-Sahara Africa. Our results suggest that large numbers of pregnant women and children were exposed to HBV from 2000 to 2013. Increased efforts to prevent new HBV infections are urgently needed in Nigeria."

Only prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare bipolar hemiarthroplasty with unipolar hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of femoral neck fracture in the elder patient were included. RevMan 5.2 from the Cochrane Collaboration was applied to perform the meta-analysis. Results: Six relevant RCTs with a total of 982 patients were retrieved. From this meta-analysis, mortality rates showed no statistical difference between two treatments, 14.7?% for bipolar versus 13.8?% for unipolar. The acetabular erosion rates were significantly different between two groups (P?=?0.01), 1.2?% in bipolar versus 5.5?% in unipolar group. Overall complication rates, dislocation rates, infection rates and reoperation rates between two groups showed no statistical difference (P?>?0.05). Neither of two treatments appeared to be superior regarding the clinical function assessed by Harris hip scores or return to pre-injury state rates (P?>?0.05). Conclusions: Both bipolar and unipolar hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of elderly patient suffering displaced femoral neck fracture achieve similar and satisfy clinical outcome in short-term follow-up.

Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis following searching of PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE electronic databases. Results Twenty-four studies, all from the USA or Europe, met the inclusion criteria. In the pooled analyses, any form of breastfeeding was found to be protective for AOM in the first 2 years of life. Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months was associated with the greatest protection (OR 0.57 95% CI 0.44, 0.75), followed by 'more vs less' breastfeeding (OR 0.67; 0.59, 0.76) and 'ever vs never' breastfeeding (OR 0.67; 0.56, 0.80). Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that breastfeeding protects against AOM until 2 years of age, but protection is greater for exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding of longer duration. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months was associated with around a 43% reduction in ever having AOM in the first 2 years of life. After 2 years of age, there is no evidence that breastfeeding protects against AOM; however, there were few studies and the evidence quality was low. ?2015 The Authors.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify whether C. pneumoniae may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by enhancing inflammation. 12 case-control, 6 cross-sectional, and 7 prospective studies with a total of 10,176 patients have been included in this meta-analysis. Odds Ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval was used to assess the seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae and differences between levels of inflammatory markers were assessed by standard mean differences. Publication bias was performed to ensure the statistical power. hsCRP, fibrinogen, interleukin- (IL-) 6, TNF, and IFN-£^ showed a significant increase in patients with atherosclerosis compared to healthy controls (P < 0.05), along with a higher seroprevalence of C. pneumoniae (OR of 3.11, 95% CI: 2.88-3.36, P < 0.001). More interestingly, hsCRP, IL-6, and fibrinogen levels were significantly higher in C. pneumoniae IgA seropositive compared to seronegative atherosclerotic patients (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests that C. pneumoniae infection may contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases by enhancing the inflammatory state, and, in particular, seropositivity to C. pneumoniae IgA, together with hsCRP, fibrinogen, and IL-6, may be predictive of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk. ? 2015 Simone Filardo et al."

Three randomized controlled trials and one comparison study, with 260 patients, were included. The experimental group consisted of patients with syndesmotic injuries treated with bioabsorbable screws versus the control group (patients treated with metallic screws). The primary outcomes were complications and wound infections. No statistically significant difference was demonstrable in the overall number of complications between the 2 groups. In the group of patients with a bioabsorbable screw, 32 of 137 (23.4%) experienced a complication versus 7 of 123 patients (5.7%) with a metallic screw. Data on wound-related complications showed no statistically significant difference, 19.7% versus 5.7%. The average maximum range of motion in both groups was comparable.

Prediction models aim to facilitate early preliminary diagnosis and treatment. We systematically reviewed prediction models for health care-associated bloodstream infection (HABSI) in neonates, identified superior models, and pooled clinical predictors. Data sources: LibHub, PubMed, and Web of Science. METHODS: The studies included designed prediction models for laboratory-confirmed HABSI or sepsis. The target population was a consecutive series of neonates with suspicion of sepsis hospitalized for ?48 hours. Clinical predictors had to be recorded at time of or before culturing. Methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. Data extracted included population characteristics, total suspected and laboratory-confirmed episodes and definition, clinical parameter definitions and odds ratios, and diagnostic accuracy parameters. RESULTS: The systematic search revealed 9 articles with 12 prediction models representing 1295 suspected and 434 laboratory-confirmed sepsis episodes. Models exhibit moderate-good methodologic quality, large pretest probability range, and insufficient diagnostic accuracy. Random effects meta-analysis showed that lethargy, pallor/mottling, total parenteral nutrition, lipid infusion, and postnatal corticosteroids were predictive for HABSI. Post hoc analysis with low-gestational-age neonates demonstrated that apnea/bradycardia, lethargy, pallor/mottling, and poor peripheral perfusion were predictive for HABSI. Limitations include clinical and statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction models should be considered as guidance rather than an absolute indicator because they all have limited diagnostic accuracy. Lethargy and pallor and/or mottling for all neonates as well as apnea and/or bradycardia and poor peripheral perfusion for very low birth weight neonates are the most powerful clinical signs. However, the clinical context of the neonate should always be considered. Copyright ? 2015 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

The objective of this study is to comprehensively evaluate the proportions, changing trends, and geographical distribution of MSM-associated HIV cases from Chinese voluntary blood donors by systematically reviewing the available literature. Study Design and Methods Major English and Chinese research databases were searched for studies reporting study locations, study years, the number of HIV infections among blood donors, and the number of HIV-positive donations associated with MSM in China. The proportion estimates were calculated; subgroup analyses and test for time trend were performed using software of comprehensive meta-analysis. Results Thirty-four studies met eligibility criteria. The pooled proportion of HIV-positive donations associated with MSM from 2001 to 2012 was 36.5% (95% confidence interval, 29.6%-44.1%). The epidemic was found to be more severe in northeast and north China compared to south China (59.6%; 55.0% vs. 3.8%, respectively). The proportion showed a significantly increasing trend over the study period (10.3% in 2001-2005; 38.6% in 2006-2009; and 47.6% in 2010-2012; trend test chi-square-=-16.42, p-<-0.001). Conclusion The relatively high proportion of MSM- associated HIV-positive donors is of concern. Efficient and effective measures focused on public education and improving knowledge of blood safety are needed to prevent this at-risk population from seeking HIV testing through blood donation. It is also imperative to expand the scope of postdonation nucleic acid testing to shorten the window period to improve blood supply safety in China. ? 2014 AABB."

Obesity is increasingly common among patients diagnosed with vascular disease. This article aims to perform systemic review and meta-analysis on 30-day postoperative mortality and complication rate between open (OAR) and endovascular (EVAR) abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in obese patients. Methods. A systematic search was performed using the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify original articles on obese (BMI ?30) patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Outcomes considered were 30-day mortality and postoperative complication rate following OAR or EVAR. Random-effects Poisson regressions were fitted for each outcome to estimate the risk ratios comparing EVAR to OAR. Results. Four studies were included in the final analyses, all of which were observational in nature. There was no evidence of publication bias as suggested by funnel plots of the outcomes. Meta-analysis showed statistically significant fewer 30-day postoperative mortality in favour of EVAR (risk ratio 0.34 [95% confidence interval 0.25, 0.48], 4 studies, 2440 patients) and early postoperative complications: myocardial infarction (0.29 [0.13, 0.64]), chest infection (0.21 [0.12, 0.38]), renal failure (0.24 [0.11, 0.51]), wound infection (0.59 [0.48, 0.74]). Risk of postoperative bowel ischemia (0.26 [0.06, 1.13]) and stroke (0.32 [0.07, 1.55]) were equivocal between EVAR and OAR. Conclusion.

Interventions that target multiple problem behaviors simultaneously in an integrated approach (referred to as integrated interventions) may improve prevention and care outcomes of persons living with HIV (PLWH). This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the effects of integrated interventions. Methods: A systematic review, including both electronic and hand searches, was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 1996 and 2014 that were designed to target at least two of the following behaviors among PLWH: HIV transmission risk behaviors, HIV care engagement, and medication adherence. Effect sizes were meta-analyzed using random-effects models. Results: Fifteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Integrated interventions significantly reduced sex without condoms [odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.59, 0.94, P=0.013, 13 effect sizes] and had marginally significant effects on improving medication adherence behaviors (OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.98, 1.85, P=0.063, 12 effect sizes) and undetectable viral load (OR=1.46, 95% CI=0.93, 2.27, P=0.098, seven effect sizes). Significant intervention effects on at least two outcomes were seen in RCTs tailored to individual needs, delivered one on one, or in settings wherein PLWH received services or care. Conclusion: Integrated interventions produced some favorable prevention and care continuum outcomes in PLWH.

Sequential therapy (ST) and concomitant therapy (CT) have been suggested as first-line regimens in areas of high clarithromycin resistance. We performed a meta-analysis to compare the eradication rates of CT with ST for H.pylori. Methods: A comprehensive literature search for studies comparing the efficacy of CT with ST was performed. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain the odds ratio (OR) of the eradication rate with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The eradication rates were considered both on an intention-to-treat (ITT) and on a per-protocol (PP) bases. Results: A total of 7 studies provided data on 2412 adult patients. Pooled estimates of the studies revealed no significant differences between CT and ST. The pooled OR was 1.116 (95% CI: 0.795-1.567, P=0.526) for ITT analysis and 1.153 (95% CI: 0.793-1.677, P=0.455) for PP analysis.

Purpose: To assess evidence from randomized, controlled trials of the timing of ART initiation in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB. Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, conference abstracts, and ClinicalTrials.gov (from January 1980 to May 2015). Study Selection: Randomized, controlled trials evaluating early versus delayed ART initiation (1 to 4 weeks vs. 8 to 12 weeks after initiation of TB treatment) or deferred ART initiation (after the end of TB treatment). Data Extraction: Three reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and the TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). Data Synthesis: The 8 included trials (n = 4568) were conducted in Africa, Asia, and the United States and were generally at low risk of bias for the assessed domains. Overall, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART (relative risk [RR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.99]; I2 = 0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis, early ART reduced mortality compared with delayed ART among patients with baseline CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 ¡Ñ109 cells/L (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.54 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%). However, a mortality benefit from early ART was not found among those with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 ¡Ñ109 cells/L (RR, 1.05 [CI, 0.68 to 1.61]; I2 = 56%). Early ART was associated with a higher incidence of TB-IRIS than delayed ART (RR, 2.31 [CI, 1.87 to 2.86]; I2 = 19%). Limitation: Few trials provided sufficient data for subgroup analysis. Conclusion: Early ART in HIV-infected adults with newly diagnosed TB improves survival in those with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 0.050 ¡Ñ109 cells/L, although this is associated with a 2-fold higher frequency of TB-IRIS. In patients with CD4+ T-cell counts greater than 0.050 ¡Ñ109 cells/L, evidence is insufficient to support or refute a survival benefit conferred by early versus delayed ART initiation. ? 2015 American College of Physicians."

Methods: Through a search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index, two independent reviewers systemically identified randomized, controlled trials that compared hybrid therapy to other pre-existing and new therapies. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain the relative risk (RR) of the eradication rate, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: We identified 6 studies, 5 of which compared hybrid therapy and sequential therapy, and 3 of which compared hybrid therapy and concomitant therapy. Pooled estimates of the 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) revealed no significant differences between hybrid therapy and sequential therapy and no evidence of heterogeneity (I2?=?0%; p?=?.803), the pooled RRs were 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93-1.12) (intention-to-treat (ITT)), and 1.03 (95% CI: 0.94-1.13) (per protocol (PP)).

We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to assess nitrofurantoin's efficacy and toxicity in the treatment of lower UTI. Methods: We performed a systematic review of all human controlled clinical trials published from 1946 to 2014 and assessing short-term (?14 days) nitrofurantoin for lower UTI. Meta-analyses assessing efficacy and adverse events were conducted on randomized trials. Results: Twenty-seven controlled trials including 4807 patients fulfilled entry criteria; most were conducted between the 1970s and 1990s and were at increased risk for various biases. Nitrofurantoin appears to have good clinical and microbiological efficacy for UTI caused by common uropathogens, with clinical cure rates varying between 79% and 92%. The most methodologically robust studies surveyed indicate overall equivalence between nitrofurantoin when given for 5 or 7 days and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials confirmed equivalence in clinical cure, but indicated a slight advantage to comparator drugs in microbiological efficacy (risk ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). If given for only 3 days, nitrofurantoin's clinical efficacy was diminished (61%-70%). Toxicity was infrequent (5%-16% in the 17 reporting studies), mild, reversible and predominantly gastrointestinal; meta-analyses confirmed no difference between nitrofurantoin and comparators. Hypersensitivity reactions such as pulmonary fibrosis and hepatotoxicity were not observed. Acquisition of resistance to nitrofurantoin is still relatively rare. Conclusions: When given short term for lower UTI, nitrofurantoin has good clinical and microbiological efficacy; toxicity is mild and predominantly gastrointestinal. ? The Author 2015."

Increased numbers of Escherichia coli and, furthermore, specific subtypes of E. coli, such as E. coli of the phylogenetic groups B2 and D have been found in the intestine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this review, we wanted to evaluate the relationship between B2 and D E. coli intestinal colonization and IBD. Methods. A systematic review with meta-analyses. We included studies comparing colonization with B2 and D E. coli in IBD patients and in controls. Random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed. Results. We included 7 studies on 163 patients with IBD and 89 controls. Among IBD patients, 57 patients had ulcerative colitis (UC) and 95 Crohn's disease (CD). Random-effects meta-analysis showed that IBD patients were more likely to have B2 E. coli intestinal colonization compared with controls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-4.16). There was little between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0). The result was confirmed in subgroup analyses of patients with UC (OR: 3.58; 95% CI: 1.62-7.90), but not CD (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 0.98-3.82). Intestinal colonization with phylogenetic group D E. coli was not found to be related to IBD, UC or CD. Conclusions. Our study reveals that intestinal colonization with phylogenetic group B2 E. coli is associated with UC. Due to the design, we are unable to determine if the colonization with B2 E. coli leads to the development of the disease or the disease increases the risk of colonization with B2 E. coli. ? 2015 ?

However, there is a remarkable diversity among the results. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess potential predictors of serofast among syphilitic patients in China. Methods: International and national electronic databases were searched up to September 2013. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also reviewed. Cohort or case-control studies addressing risk factors of serofast among syphilitic patients were included in this study. Results: We assessed 27 separate studies involving overall 6682 HIV-negative participants with syphilis of which 1962 remained in the serofast state. The serofast was positively associated with older age(Ptrend=0.001), female(summary risk ratio[sRR]=1.50, 95%CI:1.34¡V;1.68), latent syphilis(sRRlatent vs primary=3.17, 95%CI: 2.66¡V;3.77; sRRlatent vs secondary=2.00, 95%CI: 1.48¡V;2.69) as well as non-penicillin treatment(sRR =2.99, 95%CI:2.45¡V;3.67), but negatively associated with higher baseline titers(sRR&gt;1:32 vs ?1:32=0.63, 95%CI: 0.54¡V;0.75). Compared with healthy group and serological cure group, respectively, the levels of CD4 (+), IL-2, and IL-6 among serofast patients were decreased (standardized mean difference[SMD]&lt;0, P&lt;0.05), but the levels of CD8(+) and IL-10 were increased(SMD&gt;0,P&lt;0.05). Some studies also hinted the serofast was associated with subtypes i of treponema pallidum(TP) repeat gene (RR i vs d=4.67,95%CI: 1.31¡V;16.69) and TP occult infection. Conclusion: The age, gender, stage of infection, baseline titers, treatment drug, cellular immune suppression and disorders, TP occult infection and subtypes i of TP repeat gene should be considered as important predictors of serofast.

SeptiFast is a CE-marked multi-pathogen real-time PCR system capable of detecting DNA sequences of bacteria and fungi present in blood samples within a few hours. We report here a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies of SeptiFast in the setting of suspected sepsis.Methods: A comprehensive search strategy was developed to identify studies that compared SeptiFast with blood culture in suspected sepsis. Methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS. Heterogeneity of studies was investigated using a coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity and a scatter plot in receiver operator characteristic space. Bivariate model method was used to estimate summary sensitivity and specificity.Results: From 41 phase III diagnostic accuracy studies, summary sensitivity and specificity for SeptiFast compared with blood culture were 0.68 (95?% CI 0.63¡V0.73) and 0.86 (95?% CI 0.84¡V0.89) respectively. Study quality was judged to be variable with important deficiencies overall in design and reporting that could impact on derived diagnostic accuracy metrics.Conclusions: SeptiFast appears to have higher specificity than sensitivity, but deficiencies in study quality are likely to render this body of work unreliable.

Results of a meta-analysis of trials comparing robotic versus laparoscopic right colectomy,2015,Journal of Minimal Access Surgery,10.4103/0972-9941.147678,,"Background: Robotic right colectomy (RRC) is a complex procedure, offered to selected patients at institutions highly experienced with the procedure. It is still not clear if this approach is worthwhile in enhancing patient recovery and reducing post-operative complications, compared with laparoscopic right colectomy (LRC). Literature is still fragmented and no meta-analyses have been conducted to compare the two procedures. This work aims at reducing this gap in literature, in order to draw some preliminary conclusions on the differences and similarities between RRC and LRC, focusing on short-term outcomes. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies comparing RRC and LRC, and meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. Peri-operative outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality, anastomotic leakage rates, blood loss, operative time) constituted the study end points. Results: Six studies, including 168 patients undergoing RRC and 348 patients undergoing LRC were considered as suitable. The patients in the two groups were similar with respect to sex, body mass index, presence of malignant disease, previous abdominal surgery, and different with respect to age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. There were no statistically significant differences between RRC and LRC regarding estimated blood loss, rate of conversion to open surgery, number of retrieved lymph nodes, development of anastomotic leakage and other complications, overall morbidity, rates of reoperation, overall mortality, hospital stays. RRC resulted in significantly longer operative time. Conclusions: The RRC procedure is feasible, safe, and effective in selected patients. However, operative times are longer comparing to LRC and no advantages in peri-operative and post-operative outcomes are demonstrated with the use of the robotic surgical system."

Registration was based on trials comparing immunogenicity of two-dose schedules in girls 9-14 years to three-dose schedules in young women 15-26 years. We evaluate comparability of antibody levels between and within age groups and discuss potential implications for monitoring the effectiveness of HPV vaccination. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed for studies comparing immunogenicity of two- to three-dose schedules of HPV vaccination. We compared geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of vaccine-type antibodies between different dosing schedules across different age groups. Meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled GMC ratios (bivalent vaccine) of two- compared with three-dose schedules within girls. Findings: For both vaccines, two-dose immunization of girls yielded non-inferior GMCs relative to a three-dose schedule in young women up to respectively 36 and 48 months follow-up. Pooled GMC ratios for the bivalent vaccine within girls showed the two-dose schedule becoming inferior to the three-dose schedule in girls for HPV 16 at approximately two years after the first dose. For the quadrivalent vaccine, antibody responses for HPV-18 became inferior from 18 months follow-up onwards when comparing the two-dose schedule with the three-dose schedule within girls. Implications: Two-dose immunization of girls has non-inferior immunogenicity compared to a three-dose schedule among young women. However, non-inferior immunogenicity of two- compared with three-dose schedules within girls has not been shown at all time points. Due to this inconclusive evidence, implementation of two-dose HPV vaccination needs to be monitored closely. ? 2015 The British Infection Association."

Treatment outcomes in HIVco-infected adults and children are poorly documented. OBJECTIVE : To systematically assess treatment outcomes among HIV-MDR-TB co-infected patients. METHODS : We searched two databases and the proceedings of an annual international conference up to November 2014 for studies reporting on major clinical outcomes among HIV-MDR-TB-co-infected adults and children, and pooled the results using random-effects meta-analysis. RESULT S : Of 4812 abstracts and articles screened, 30 studies providing data on 2578 adults and 147 children were included. Overall pooled treatment success was 56.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46.2-67.6), 49.9% (95%CI 38.5-61.2) among adults and 83.4% (95%CI 74.7-92) among children. Mortality was 38% in adults (95%CI 28-48.1) and 11.4% (95%CI 5.8-17.1) in children. Loss to follow-up was higher among adults (16.1%, 95%CI 9-23.2) than among children (3.9%, 95%CI 0.9-6.9). Adverse events were experienced by the majority of patients; however, this was inconsistently documented. The use of fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and Group IV drugs appeared to be associated with treatment success. CONCLUS ION: The proportion of HIV-MDR-TB-coinfected patients achieving treatment success was similar to success rates reported among MDR-TB patients in general, regardless of HIV status; however, mortality was higher, particularly among adults, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and more effective treatment regimens. ? 2015 The Union."

Sources An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in December/2014 in PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register plus hand-searching. Study selection Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomized or not. Conclusions Twenty-eight publications were included, with a total of 1216 platform-switched implants (16 failures; 1.32%) and 1157 platform-matched implants (13 failures; 1.12%). There was less MBL loss at implants with platform-switching than at implants with platform-matching (mean difference -0.29, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.19; P < 0.00001). An increase of the mean difference of MBL between the procedures was observed with the increase in the follow-up time (P = 0.001) and with the increase of the mismatch between the implant platform and the abutment (P = 0.001). Due to lack of satisfactory information, meta-analyses for the outcomes 'implant failure' and 'postoperative infection' were not performed. The results of the present review should be interpreted with caution due to the presence of uncontrolled confounding factors in the included studies, most of them with short follow-up periods. Clinical significance The question whether platform-matched implants are more at risk for failure and loose more marginal bone than platform-switched implants has received increasing attention in the last years. As the philosophies of treatment alter over time, a periodic review of the different concepts is necessary to refine techniques and eliminate unnecessary procedures, forming a basis for optimum treatment. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

The efficacy of antiretrovirals as postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent viral acquisition was demonstrated in nonhuman primate models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the early 1990s. To complement the evidence base for efficacy of HIV PEP in humans, we systematically reviewed the published data on PEP efficacy across animal studies. Methods. PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched from inception to 31 May 2014 for randomized and nonrandomized studies reporting seroconversions among uninfected animals exposed to HIV or simian immunodeficiency virus, irrespective of route of exposure. Seroconversion risk data were pooled using random-effects models, and associations explored through meta-regression. Results. Twenty-five studies (408 primates) were included for review. The risk of serconversion was 89% lower among animals exposed to PEP compared with those that did not receive PEP (odds ratio, 0.11 [95% confidence interval, .05-.23]). Heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0.0%). In meta-regression, a significant association was found between timing of PEP and seroconversion and the use of tenofovir compared with other drugs. Conclusions. This review provides further evidence of the protective benefit of PEP in preventing HIV acquisition, and the importance of initiating PEP as early as possible following virus exposure. ?

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of controlled venous pressure in liver surgery and further to compare the clinical outcomes of low central venous pressure by infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping (IVCC) and intraoperative anesthetic control (IAC). Methods. Online databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinical trials.gov, and China biology medicine database were comprehensively searched. After identifying relevant studies out of the search results, quality assessment was performed according to the methods recommended by the Cochrane collaboration. And meta-analysis was performed by both direct comparison and indirect comparison. Results. Thirteen studies containing 1252 patients were included. Compared with control, controlled venous pressure significantly decreased central venous pressure, total blood loss, blood loss during transection, transfusion rate, and total incidence of complications. Further analysis of IVCC and IAC showed that there was no significant difference in aspects of main clinical outcomes. Conclusions. Controlled venous pressure significantly decreased central venous pressure and achieved improvement of bleeding control in liver surgery. It reduced total incidence of complications and chest infection, while it caused concerns about heart disorder. Although IVCC was not worse than IAC in therapeutic effect, a superiority between them still needs to be explored. ? 2015 Xue Liang Zhang et al."

The case fatality risk was widely used to assess severity, but another underexplored and potentially more immediate measure is the hospitalization fatality risk (HFR), defined as the probability of death among H1N1pdm09 cases who required hospitalization for medical reasons. In this review, we searched for relevant studies published in MEDLINE (PubMed) and EMBASE between April 1, 2009, and January 9, 2014. Crude estimates of the HFR ranged from 0% to 52%, with higher estimates from tertiary-care referral hospitals in countries with a lower gross domestic product, but in wealthy countries the estimate was 1%-3% in all settings. Point estimates increased substantially with age and with lower gross domestic product. Early in the next pandemic, estimation of a standardized HFR may provide a picture of the severity of infection, particularly if it is presented in comparison with a similarly standardized HFR for seasonal influenza in the same setting. ?

Methods A comprehensive literature search was done using PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials. Relevant papers were retrieved and analyzed. The authors performed a meta-analysis of all available data. Search terms included epidural, steroids, discectomy, lumbar disc surgery, herniated lumbar disc, methylprednisolone, and perioperative.The primary outcome was surgical complications such as wound infection or need for reoperation. Secondary outcomes were pain and postoperative narcotic usage. Results Sixteen trials and 1 retrospective study (a total of 1933 patients) were eligible for inclusion in this study. In all studies, steroids were added epidurally over the nerve root before closure in cases, and control patients underwent discectomy alone. The mean age (42.7 years vs 42.4 years; RR 0.30 [95% CI -0.30 to 0.90], p = 0.32), overall complication rates (2.69% vs 1.18%; RR 1.94 [95% CI 0.72-5.26], p = 0.19), and infectious complication rates (0.94% vs 0.08%; RR 4.58 [95% CI 0.75-27.95], p = 0.10) were similar between the steroid group and control group, respectively. Con clusion s There is good evidence that epidural steroids can decrease pain in the short term and decrease the usage of postoperative narcotics after lumbar spinal surgery for degenerative spinal disease. The authors' results demonstrate a trend toward increased infection with epidural steroid use, but there was not a statistically significant difference.

We aimed to investigate the perioperative outcomes of 2 popular reconstruction methods: pancreaticogastrostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy. Data Sources Randomized controlled trials comparing pancreaticogastrostomy versus pancreaticojejunostomy were identified from literature databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library). The meta-analysis included 8 studies: 607 patients who underwent pancreaticogastrostomy and 604 who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy. Postoperative pancreatic fistula and intra-abdominal fluid collection rates were significantly lower after pancreaticogastrostomy compared with pancreaticojejunostomy. No statistically significant differences were found in the incidence of delayed gastric emptying, biliary fistula, hemorrhage, reoperation, wound infection, overall morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. Conclusions Our meta-analysis suggests that pancreaticogastrostomy not only reduces the rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula but also decreases its severity. Pancreaticogastrostomy is associated with a lower rate of intra-abdominal fluid collection. Our results suggest that pancreaticogastrostomy should be the preferred reconstruction method. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Data: The eligibility criteria, based on the PECO strategy, were the following: observational human studies whose subjects were mother and child pairs (P) contaminated by S. mutans (E); comparison according to the presence or absence of S. mutans (C); and whether there is transmission (O). The qualitative analysis was performed by assessing the risk of bias of the included studies, while quantitative synthesis was performed through comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (p < 0.05). Sources: Two reviewers performed the database search of studies published between January 1950 and May 2014. The strategy included observational studies that assessed the vertical transmission of S. mutans from mothers to children through analyzing genetic strains. Study selection: It was found 166 non-duplicated studies. However, after reviewing the articles in full and applying the eligibility criteria, 36 papers were selected for qualitative analysis and 19 for quantitative analysis. The cumulative meta-analysis demonstrated vertical transmission of S. mutans from mother to child (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated evidence of vertical transmission of S. mutans from mother to child because there was an association between S. mutans n mothers and their respective children. Clinical significance: The knowledge of the S. mutans strains is important because the virulence of the microorganisms is varied; also, the virulence affects the dental caries evolution rate, being more or less aggressive. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study is to examine the available evidence on the application of barbed sutures on both laparoscopic and robotic operations in the field of gynecologic surgery. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. In total, 1991 patients were included in the study. The duration of closure with knotless suture ranged from 3.9 to 13 minutes, which was less than the use of conventional suture in every study. The duration of suturing was significantly less in the barbed suture group during hysterectomy, the mean difference between the observed groups was 2.41 minutes per operation (95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.59) whereas in myomectomy there was no statistically significant difference between compared groups. Concerning the estimated blood loss and the presence of major bleeding in hysterectomy, no statistical difference between the 2 groups was observed, while the estimated blood loss in myomectomy was found to be statistically significant (P =.04). Regarding the dehiscence of vaginal cuff in hysterectomy, no statistically significant difference was observed (1031 patients, odds ratio = 1.63; 95% confidence interval = 0.37-7.25).

We therefore performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between antiviral therapy and the risk of colectomy. Methods: Multiple electronic databases were searched systematically through July 2014 for studies reporting the risk of colectomy in patients with UC with CMV stratified by treatment with antiviral agents. Colectomy rates were assessed for the overall cohort and stratified by corticosteroid (CS) refractoriness. We estimated summary odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, using random-effects model, and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria to appraise the quality of evidence. Results: Fifteen observational studies (333 patients with UC with CMV, 43.2% treated with antiviral agents) were identified, of which 8 stratified patients according to CS-refractory disease (55.4% treated with antiviral agents). Antiviral therapy resulted in a significantly lower risk of colectomy in patients with CS-refractory disease (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.49; I 2 0%) but not in the overall population of patients with UC (odds ratio, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-2.76; I 2 65). The quality evidence was low. The results were stable when restricting the analysis to patients with a tissue diagnosis of CMV and studies that defined CS-refractory disease as a failure to respond to intravenous CS.

Resulting shifts in wildlife ecology can alter infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species transmission, yet predicting host-pathogen responses to resource provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropogenic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen invasion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical framework, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites. These results carry implications for wildlife disease management and highlight areas for future work, such as how resource shifts might affect virulence evolution. ? 2015 The Authors.

However, there are no evidence syntheses describing the impact of preoperative anaemia on postoperative outcomes. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies exploring associations between preoperative anaemia and postoperative outcomes was performed. Studies investigating trauma, burns, transplant, paediatric and obstetric populations were excluded. The primary outcome was 30-day or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury, stroke and myocardial infarction. Predefined analyses were performed for the cardiac and non-cardiac surgery subgroups. A post hoc analysis was undertaken to evaluate the relationship between anaemia and infection. Data are presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 per cent c.i. Results From 8973 records, 24 eligible studies including 949 445 patients were identified. Some 371 594 patients (39¡P1 per cent) were anaemic.

Information from a wide range of other sources, including the grey literature, was also analysed. Two independent reviewers extracted data on treatment adherence and study characteristics. Study data on the association between being employed and adhering to ART were pooled using a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity and sources of bias were evaluated.Findings The meta-analysis included 28 studies published between 1996 and 2014 that together involved 8743 HIV-infected individuals from 14 countries. The overall pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between being employed and adhering to ART was 1.27 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.04-1.55). The association was significant for studies from low-income countries (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.58-2.18) and high-income countries (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.02-1.74) but not middle-income countries (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.62-1.42). In addition, studies published after 2011 and larger studies showed less association between employment and adherence than earlier and small studies, respectively.Conclusion Employed HIV-infected individuals, particularly those in low-and high-income countries, were more likely to adhere to ART than unemployed individuals. Further research is needed on the mechanisms by which employment and ART adherence affect each other and on whether employment-creation interventions can positively influence ART adherence, HIV disease progression and quality of life. ? 2015 World Health Organization, All rights reserved."

The purposes of current study were to perform a systematic review of overlapping meta-analyses comparing intramedullary nail and plate fixation for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures, to appraise the methodological quality and the quality of reporting of meta-analyses, and to propose a guide through the currently discordant available evidence. This systematic review was performed according to the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. The literature was systematically reviewed to identify meta-analyses comparing intramedullary nail and plate fixation for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures. Only meta-analyses exclusively including randomized clinical trials (RCTs) met eligibility criteria in this systematic review. Methodological quality for each included study was assessed using the Oxford Levels of Evidence and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews Instrument. We extracted all variables from the included studies and listed the results reported by them. Heterogeneity information of each variable was extracted for the included studies. An I 2 of <60% is accepted in this systematic review. The Jadad algorithm was then applied to determine which meta-analyses provided the best evidence. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria in this study. All studies included RCTs or quasi-RCT and were Level II of evidence. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews scores varied from 6 to 10 with a median of 7.86. Heterogeneity of each outcome was acceptable in those meta-analyses pooled results. The Jadad algorithm suggested that the meta-analyses can be selected based on the search strategies and application of selection. As a result, 2 meta-analyses with more RCTs were selected in this systematic review. The best available evidence suggested that the differences between intramedullary nail and plate fixation were not significant in fracture union, radial nerve injury, and infection. But intramedullary nail significantly increased the risk of shoulder complications (shoulder impingement and restriction of shoulder movement) and reoperation. We concluded that plate fixation is superior to intramedullary nail for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures. Copyright ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

The aim of this metaanalysis was to clarify the efficacy of first-line and second-line therapies in Korea. This systematic review will provide an overview of H. pylori eradication and present new therapeutic strategies used in Korea. An extensive search of the literature concerning STT, sequential therapy (SET), concomitant therapy (CT), bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BCQT) and various other therapies used in Korea was performed. All selected studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Eighteen RCTs were eligible for systematic review. The alternative regimens comparing seven-day STT as a first-line therapy include SET, CT, levofloxacin-based therapy (LBT), BCQT, and STT with prolonged duration. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that SET is superior to seven-day STT. The overall eradication rate by intention to treat (ITT) analysis was 69.8% for STT and 79.7% for SET. The overall eradication rate by per-protocol (PP) analysis was 77.0% for STT and 85.0% for SET. The odds ratios for the ITT and PP eradication rate were 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.74) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.76), respectively. In the subgroup analysis, however, there were no significant differences between SET and STT with prolonged durations. Alternative regimens to seven-day BCQT as second-line therapy include LBT, moxifloxacin-based therapy and 14-day BCQT. The eradication rates of these alternative regimens were not superior to that of the conventional treatment.

However, with changes of disease patterns and dyspepsia definition, the prevalence of organic lesions at endoscopy in dyspepsia patients and the predictive values of alarm features and age for in malignancy remain unclear in Asian population. Aims To evaluate the appropriateness of prompt endoscopy as an initial dyspepsia management strategy, we investigated the organic lesion detection rates in Asian dyspepsia patients as well as the diagnostic accuracies of alarm features and age thresholds for malignancy. Methods Literature was retrieved from MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and CINAHL Plus. The prevalence rates of organic lesions and young cancer patients among dyspeptic patients and the sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of alarm features and ages were estimated. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed and the area under the curve (AUC) calculated. Subgroup, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were performed. Results Of the 18 included studies, 15 reported organic lesion detection rates, and six and five analysed the predictive values of alarm features and ages respectively. The overall malignancy detection rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.80-2.10). Among cancer patients, 17.8% (95% CI: 10.90-29.00) were younger than 45 years and 3.0% (95% CI: 2.50-3.50) were younger than 35 years. The diagnostic accuracy of alarm features for predicting malignancy was moderate (DOR: 4.87, 95% CI: 2.72-8.71; AUC = 0.74). The diagnostic accuracy at age >35 years (DOR: 9.41, 95% CI: 7.89-11.21; AUC = 0.82) was better than that at age >45 years (DOR: 3.50, 95% CI: 2.32-5.27; AUC = 0.70). Conclusions The malignancy detection rate and proportion of young cancer patients were high among Asian dyspepsia patients. Alarm features and age were of limited value for predicting malignancy, and prompt endoscopy should be considered as the initial strategy for dyspepsia in Asian populations. The optimal age threshold for endoscopy screening in Asia might be 35 years. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

We systematically reviewed the safety of EFV in first-line therapy. Methods: Four databases were searched until October 2014 for randomized trials comparing EFV against non-EFV-based regimens for the treatment of antiretroviral-naive HIV-positive adults and children. The primary outcome was drug discontinuation as a result of any adverse event. Relative risks and proportions were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Forty-two trials were included for review. A lower relative and absolute risk of discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions was seen with EFV compared to nevirapine. The relative and absolute risk of discontinuation was greater for EFV compared with low-dose EFV, rilpivirine, tenofovir, atazanavir, and maraviroc. The relative risk of discontinuation was greater for EFV compared with dolutegravir and raltegravir, but absolute risks were not significantly different. There was no difference in the risk of any severe clinical adverse events for any comparison. With the exception of dizziness, fewer than 10% of patients exposed to EFV experienced any other specific type of neuropsychiatric event. No suicides were reported. Conclusions: This review found that over 90% of patients remained on an EFV-based first-line regimen after an average follow-up time of 78 weeks. The relative risk of discontinuations due to adverse events was higher for EFV compared with most other first-line options, but absolute differences were less than 5% for all comparisons.

Potential selection bias exists in most studies using HIV-positive TB patients. An update meta-Analysis was carried out to derive a more reliable assessment of the association between FokI polymorphisms and TB risk, especially in HIV-negative TB patients. All major databases from inception to June 2015 were searched for all publications that studied the association between FokI polymorphism and TB risk. The odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated according to the frequencies of genotypes. In total, 32 studies with 4894 cases and 5319 controls were included in this meta-Analysis. In the overall analysis, the estimated OR was 1.34 (95% CI1/41.091-1.646, P1/40.005) in the best genetic model (recessive model, ff vs fFFF) with moderate heterogeneity (I21/432.2%, P1/40.043).

To determine the strategies of prevention of hospital-acquired pneumonia that reduce mortality in intensive care unit (ICU). Methods. We followed PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (through 10 June 2014) as well as reference lists of articles. We included all randomized controlled trials conducted in critically ill adult patients hospitalized in ICUs and evaluating digestive prophylactic methods (selective digestive decontamination [SDD], acidification of gastric content, early enteral feeding, prevention of microinhalation); circuit prophylactic methods (closed suctioning systems, early tracheotomy, aerosolized antibiotics, humidification, lung secretion drainage, silver- coated endotracheal tubes) or oropharyngeal prophylactic methods (selective oropharyngeal decontamination, patient position, sinusitis prophylaxis, subglottic secretion drainage, tracheal cuff monitoring). One reviewer extracted data that were checked by 3 others. The primary outcome was the mortality rate in the ICU. Results. We identified 157 randomized trials to pool in a meta-analysis. The primary outcome was available in 145 studies (n = 37 156). The risk ratio (RR) for death was 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], .92-.99; P = .02) in the intervention groups. In subgroup analysis, only SDD significantly decreased mortality compared with control (n = 10 227; RR, 0.84 [95% CI, .76-.92; P &lt; .001]). The RR for in-ICU death was 0.78 (95% CI, .69-.89; P &lt; .001; I2 = 33%) in trials investigating SDD with systemic antimicrobial therapy and 1.00 (.84-1.21; P = .96; I2 = 0%) without systemic antimicrobial therapy.

Results: Twenty eight studies were eligible for inclusion, reporting true outcomes for 10 806 traced patients attending approximately 258 ART facilities. None were from outside sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty three studies reported 4.5-54.4% traced LTFU patients self-transferring care, providing a pooled estimate of 18.6% (95% CI 15.8-22.0%). A significant positive association was found between rates of self-transfer and LTFU in the ART cohort.

Methods: An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in July 2014. Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomised or not, interventional or observational. The estimates of an intervention were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) in millimetres. Results: The search strategy resulted in 44 publications. A total of 5029 dental implants were tilted (82 failures; 1.63%), and 5732 implants were axially placed (104 failures; 1.81%). The difference between the procedures did not significantly affect the implant failure rates (P = 0.40), with a RR of 1.14 (95% CI 0.84-1.56). A statistically significant difference was found for implant failures when studies evaluating implants inserted in maxillae only were pooled (RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.05-2.74; P = 0.03),the same not happening for the mandible (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.39-1.52; P = 0.45). There were no apparent significant effects of tilted dental implants on the occurrence of marginal bone loss (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.08; P = 0.32). Due to lack of satisfactory information, meta-analysis for the outcome 'postoperative infection' was not performed. Conclusions: It is suggested that the differences in angulation of dental implants might not affect the implant survival or the marginal bone loss. The reliability and validity of the data collected and the potential for biases and confounding factors are some of the shortcomings of the present study. Clinical significance: The question whether tilted implants are more at risk for failure than axially placed implants has received increasing attention in the last years. As the philosophies of treatment alter over time, a periodic review of the different concepts is necessary to refine techniques and eliminate unnecessary procedures.

Methods: A systematic literature review based on PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library Database in any language regarding postoperative cell salvage following TKR or THR was performed. High quality of randomized controlled trials were identified. The data was analyzed using Rev Man 5.2. Results: 19 randomized controlled trials (12 in TKR, 4 in THR and 3 in both) about 3482 patients were identified and included in this meta-analysis. Postoperative cell salvage significantly reduced the allogeneic blood transfusion requirement after TKR (RR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.30 to 0.72) and THR (RR = 0.46, 95%CI = 0.32 to 0.68).

No significant differences were detected regarding length of hospital stay, the incidence of febrile reaction, wound infection and deep vein thrombosis. Conclusion: The results strengthen the fact that postoperative cell salvage is effective and safe to reduce the rate of transfusion after TKR and THR.

Relative risks (RR) for each outcome were combined using random effects meta-analysis and were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) availability. Results: 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pregnancy was not associated with progression to HIV-related illness [summary RR: 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-2.61], AIDS-defining illness (summary RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.74-1.25) or mortality (summary RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.62-1.53), but there was an association with low CD4 counts (summary RR: 1.41, 95%CI: 0.99-2.02) and HIV-related death (summary RR: 1.65, 95%CI: 1.06-2.57). In settings where ART was available, there was no evidence that pregnancy accelerated progress to HIV/AIDS-defining illnesses, death and drop in CD4 count. In settings without ART availability, effect estimates were consistent with pregnancy increasing the risk of progression to HIV/AIDS-defining illnesses and HIV-related or all-cause mortality, but there were too few studies to draw meaningful conclusions. Conclusions: In the absence of ART, pregnancy is associated with small but appreciable increases in the risk of several negative HIV outcomes, but the evidence is too weak to draw firm conclusions. When ART is available, the effects of pregnancy on HIV disease progression are attenuated and there is little reason to discourage healthy HIV-infected women who desire to become pregnant from doing so. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Only randomized controlled trials were included. The treatments that were evaluated included non-surgical, open surgery, intramedullary pin, locking plate, arthroplasty, and minimally invasive surgical treatments. A meta-analysis was performed on the difference in functional outcomes and quality of life (QoL) between participants undergoing surgical versus non-surgical treatment. Results: Out of 254 participants in the studies who were analyzed, 127 were treated surgically.

However, the examination of modifiable psychosocial and behavioral correlates of condom use self-efficacy is lacking. Recent investigations have highlighted the association of body dissatisfaction with condom use self-efficacy, and the current study conducted a meta-analysis on all available data addressing this relationship. Eleven individual effect-size parameters from nine studies yielded a total sample of 2495 men and women participants. A random-effects model revealed an average effect-size of r=-25, Cohen's d=-0.52, which is moderate in strength. As body dissatisfaction increases, ones' self-efficacy regarding the use of condoms diminishes. Integrating interventions to decrease body dissatisfaction and sexual risk behaviors may prove to be an effective strategy to decrease STIs. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

The advent of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry for the rapid ID of pathogens was a major breakthrough in microbiology. Recently, this method was combined with extraction methods for pathogens directly from positive blood cultures. This review summarizes the results obtained so far with the commercial Sepsityper sample preparation kit, which is now approved for in vitro diagnostic use. Summarizing data from 21 reports, the Sepsityper kit allowed a reliable ID on the species level of 80% of 3320 positive blood culture bottles. Gram negative bacteria resulted consistently in higher ID rates (90%) compared to Gram positive bacteria (76%) or yeast (66%). No relevant misidentifications on the genus level were reported at a log(score)cut-of of 1.6. The Sepsityper kit is a simple and reproducible method which extends the MALDI-TOF technology to positive blood culture specimens and shortens the time to result by several hours or even days. In combination with antibiotic stewardship programs, this rapid ID allows a much faster optimization of antibiotic therapy in patients with sepsis compared to conventional workflows.

In this context, the reduction of postoperative pancreatic fistula by means of a dual-loop (Roux-en-Y) reconstruction with isolation of the pancreaticojejunostomy from biliary drainage has been evaluated in several studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes evidence of effectiveness and safety of the isolation of the pancreaticojejunostomy compared with conventional single-loop reconstruction. Methods: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing outcomes of dual-loop reconstruction with isolated pancreaticojejunostomy and single-loop reconstruction were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed and the results presented as weighted risk ratios or mean differences with their corresponding 95 per cent c.i. Results: Of 83 trials screened for eligibility, three RCTs and four CCTs including a total of 802 patients were finally included. Quantitative synthesis showed no significant statistical difference between the two procedures regarding postoperative pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, haemorrhage, intra-abdominal fluid collection or abscess, bile leakage, wound infection, pneumonia, overall morbidity, mortality, reinterventions, reoperations, perioperative blood loss and length of hospital stay. Duration of surgery was significantly longer in patients undergoing dual-loop reconstruction. Conclusion: Dual-loop (Roux-en-Y) reconstruction with isolated pancreaticojejunostomy after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy is not superior to single-loop reconstruction regarding pancreatic fistula rate or other relevant outcomes. Additional superiority trials are therefore not warranted, although a high-quality trial may be justified to prove equivalence or non-inferiority. ? 2015 BJS Society Ltd."

However, it is not known which surgical approach has a lower prevalence of surgical complications after low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma (LARRC). METHODS We conducted a literature search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid, Embase and Cochrane databases to identify studies published between 1966 and 2013 focusing on elective surgical complications related to defunctioning LI and LC undertaken to protect a distal rectal anastomosis after LARRC. RESULTS Five studies (two randomized controlled trials, one prospective non-randomized trial, and two retrospective trials) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Outcomes of 1,025 patients (652 LI and 373 LC) were analyzed. After the construction of a LI or LC, there was a significantly lower prevalence of sepsis (p=0.04), prolapse (p=0.03), and parastomal hernia (p=0.02) in LI patients than in LC patients. Also, the prevalence of overall complications was significantly lower in those who received LIs compared with those who received LCs (p < 0.0001). After closure of defunctioning loops, there were significantly fewer wound infections (p=0.006) and incisional hernias (p=0.007) in LI patients than in LC patients, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of overall complications. CONCLUSION The results of this meta-analysis show that a defunctioning LI may be superior to LC with respect to a lower prevalence of surgical complications after LARRC."

This study assessed systematically the current knowledge on the effect of probiotic bacteria on duration of acute rotavirus diarrhea in children compared with control. Methods: The PubMed, Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR) and Ovid (Wolters Kluwer Health) were searched between 1980 to June 15, 2013. Randomized controlled trials including the administration of probiotics for treatment of rotavirus diarrhea in infants and children were reviewed. Results: A total number of 1244 articles were found through the aforementioned search. 203 articles were selected after the first screening of title and abstract. The intervention group included subjects who received probiotic strains and dosage in any conditions. Placebo or any similar vehicle without probiotic was used in the controlled trials. Finally, 14 articles were selected. The outcomes from each study were considered in the duration of diarrhea. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software. The pooled estimate of efficacy of probiotics in prevention or treatment of disease yielded in all studies a mean difference of 0.41 (CI 95%: -0.56 to -0.25; p<0.001). The pooled estimate of efficacy of lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and other probiotics significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea.

However, PTG also attracts controversy as a result of ambiguous empirical findings. The extent that demographic variables, injury factors, subjective beliefs, and psychological health are associated with PTG following ABI is not clear. Consequently, this systematic review and meta-analysis explores the correlates of variables within these four broad areas and PTG. From a total of 744 published studies addressing PTG in people with ABI, eight studies met inclusion criteria for detailed examination. Meta-analysis of these studies indicated that growth was related to employment, longer education, subjective beliefs about change post-injury, relationship status, older age, longer time since injury, and lower levels of depression. Results from homogeneity analyses indicated significant inter-study heterogeneity across variables. There is general support for the idea that people with ABI can experience growth, and that various demographics, injury-related variables, subjective beliefs and psychological health are related to growth. The contribution of social integration and the forming of new identities post-ABI to the experience of PTG is explored. These meta-analytic findings are however constrained by methodological limitations prevalent in the literature. Clinical and research implications are discussed with specific reference to community and collective factors that enable PTG. ? 2015 Grace, Kinsella, Muldoon and Fortune."

This study aimed to assess outcome reporting from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses in inguinal hernia surgery.Methods: RCTs and meta-analyses comparing surgical technique or mesh type for primary inguinal hernia repair were systematically identified. Verbatim details, type, frequency and definition of clinician-observed and -assessed outcomes were summarised. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were analysed for instrument validity and frequency of domain reporting.Results: 40 RCTs (10,810 patients) and 7 meta-analyses (17,280 patients) were identified. No single PROM was reported by all studies. There were 58 different clinician-observed outcomes, with recurrence (n?=?47, 100?%), wound infection (n?=?33, 70.2?%), haematoma (n?=?31, 77.5?%) and seroma formation (n?=?22, 46.8?%) being most frequently reported. All studies measured patients¡¦ views, although only 12 (30.0?%) used validated instruments. The SF36 was the most commonly used multi-dimensional valid PROM (n?=?7), and a visual analogue scale assessing pain (n?=?32) was the most frequently used unidimensional scale. Non-validated questionnaires assessed 25 other aspects of patients¡¦ health. Two meta-analyses defined recurrence and three chronic pain although neither ensured that included RCTs adhered to the definitions.Conclusions: Outcome reporting from RCTs concerning inguinal hernia repair is inconsistent and poorly defined, limiting meta-analyses, which themselves do not control for the differing definitions of assessed outcomes.

Several studies performed in cardiac surgery suggested an increased mortality in patients receiving a propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia. Furthermore, the possibility of infections and the 'propofol syndrome' have suggested that propofol might be dangerous. Nonetheless, propofol is widely used in different settings because of its characteristics: fast induction, rapid elimination, short duration of action, smooth recovery from anaesthesia, few adverse effects, no teratogenic effects, characteristics that have undoubtedly contributed to its popularity. The effect of propofol on survival is unknown. We decided to carry out a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled studies ever performed on propofol vs. any comparator in any clinical setting.Methods: Pertinent studies were independently searched in BioMedCentral, PubMed, Embase, Clinicaltrial.gov, and Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials by expert investigators. The following inclusion criteria were used: random allocation to treatment, comparison between propofol and any comparator in any clinical setting.Results: One hundred thirty-three studies randomizing 14,516 patients were included. No differences in mortality between patients receiving propofol [349/6957 (5.0%)] vs. any comparator [340/7559 (4.5%)] were observed in the overall population [risk ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval (0.93 to 1.18), P = 0.5] and in several sub-analyses.Conclusion: Inspite of theoretical concerns, propofol has no detrimental effect on survival according to the largest meta-analysis of randomized trials ever performed on hypnotic drug. ? 2014 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

Methods A meta-analysis of seven cohort studies from a single institution was performed. Laparoscopic gastric bypass and colectomies, as well as open resections of cancer of the colon, rectum, pancreas, stomach and oesophagus, were included. The predictive value of CRP was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Of 1986 patients, 577 (29¡P1 (95 per cent c.i. 27¡P1 to 31¡P3) per cent) had at least one postoperative infectious complication. Patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass (383 patients) or colectomy (285), and those having open gastric (97) or colorectal (934) resections were combined in a meta-analysis.

Using Medline, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar until October 31, 2013, we identified 10 studies examining the safety and efficacy of specific integrin inhibitors-vedolizumab, which targets an epitope comprising the a4b7 heterodimer; natalizumab,which recognizes the a4 integrin subunit; etrolizumab,which is specific for theb7 subunit-in the treatment of CD and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD patients receiving either vedolizumab or natalizumab demonstrated a modest increase in remission rate, when compared with that of the placebo group. Further, although both treatments reduced the CDAI slightly, the observed clinical response was less robust than that of the remission rate. UC patients treated with vedolizumab and natalizumab were found to show more prominent increases in both remission and clinical response, compared with placebo, than patients with CD. Etrolizumab, however, was not found to significantly affect either response or remission rates in UC patients.

The incidence of PI-IBS ranges between 3% and over 30% of people after infectious gastroenteritis. Aim To perform a meta-analysis pools and report data concerning the relative risk (RR) of PI-IBS after TD. Methods Database search using Medline through PubMed, Scopus, EBM Reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) and PsycINFO was performed to identify relevant studies. Those that met the inclusion criteria were pooled. A random effects model (Mantel-Haenszel) was performed. Results Six eligible studies were found. In three of six studies, the authors reported a statistically significant association of TD and PI-IBS. The pooled RR was 3.35 (95% CI: 2.22-5.05) with a significant overall effect (P < 0.00001). Overall PI-IBS incidence was 5.4% in TD subjects and 1.4% in healthy subjects. There was no significant heterogeneity within the pooled studies (I2 = 5%). Self-reported TD alone resulted in an over 1.5-fold RR for PI-IBS compared to laboratory-confirmed TD [RR 3.90 (95% CI: 2.35-6.49) vs. RR 2.42 (95% CI: 1.22-4.78)]. Conclusions There is a strong association between travellers' diarrhoea and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.

Compared with DLC, ELC was associated with lower hospital costs, fewer work days lost (mean difference (MD) -11¡P07 (95 per cent c.i. -16¡P21 to -5¡P94) days; P < 0¡P001), higher patient satisfaction and quality of life, lower risk of wound infection (relative risk 0¡P65, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P47 to 0¡P91; P = 0¡P01) and shorter hospital stay (MD -3¡P38 (-4¡P23 to -2¡P52) days; P < 0¡P001), but a longer duration of operation (MD 11¡P12 (4¡P57 to 17¡P67) min; P < 0¡P001). There were no significant differences between the two groups in mortality, bile duct injury, bile leakage, conversion to open cholecystectomy or overall complications. Conclusion For patients with acute cholecystitis, ELC appears as safe and effective as DLC. ELC might be associated with lower hospital costs, fewer work days lost, and greater patient satisfaction. ? 2015 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that assessed the relationship between physical activity and risk of gastric cancer. Methods: Following a standard protocol, we searched medical literature databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Google Scholar) from inception to July 2012, and conducted a random effects meta-analysis. Results: Seven prospective cohorts and four case-control studies of physical activity and gastric cancer risk, with 1 535 006 people and 7944 cases of gastric cancer were included. We found a modest protective association between sufficient physical activity and gastric cancer risk (relative risk: 0.81 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.96); I2=68.5%) in the prospective studies and (relative risk: 0.78 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.91); I2=0%) in case-control studies. The association appeared weaker in smokers than in non-smokers (p heterogeneity=0.035). The association may also be weaker for gastric cardia cancer relative to the distal non-cardia subtypes. Physical activity type (recreational or occupational), intake of alcohol, total energy intake, consumption of fruits and vegetables and infection with Helicobacter pylori had no influence on the association. The effect measure from cohort studies (relative risk: 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.97); I2=61.7%) and case-control studies (relative risk: 0.83 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.04); I2=49.8%) did not differ materially at higher physical activity levels. Conclusions: We conclude that a regular physical activity may be protective against stomach cancer risk. ? 2015, BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."

Methods: Relevant original studies were searched in electronic databases of PubMed, Medline, Embase and CNKI (all through October 2014). RCTs that investigated the effectiveness or complications between both groups and provided sufficient data of interest were included in this meta-analysis. Results: Five RCTs fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this meta-analysis, with 128 participants in a plate fixation (PF) group and 157 in an intramedullary fixation (IF) group. Patients were followed up for at least one?year in all the studies. Compared to PFs, IF is a better alternative for treatment of MSCFs than PF, with a reduced surgery time, a shorter incision, rapid union time, better shoulder function at one year and fewer complications such as infection, symptomatic hardware and hypertrophic scar. In other aspects such as complications of implant failure, refracture and nonunion, both techniques were comparable. Conclusions: If the surgery is indicated, intramedullary fixation has more advantages than plate fixation for treatment of mid-shaft clavicular fracture.

Methods: Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on HCWs, published in English until October 2013, comparing TST and QFT results, were selected. For each study Cohen's £e value and a 95% confidence interval were calculated. Summary measures and indexes of heterogeneity between studies were calculated. Results:29 studies were selected comprising a total of 11,434 HCWs. Cohen's £e for agreement between TST and QFT for 24 of them was 0.28 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.35), with the best value in high TB incidence countries and the lowest rate of BCG vaccination. Conclusion: Currently, there is no gold standard for TB screening and the most-used diagnostic tools show low agreement. For evidence-based health surveillance in HCWs, occupational physicians need to consider a number of factors influencing screening results, such as TB incidence, vaccination status, age and working seniority. ? 2015 Lamberti et al.; licensee BioMed Central."

Meanwhile handwork retrieval was also conducted and references of included literature were retrieved. Two reviewers independently screened literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality of included studies. Metaanalysis was then conducted using RevMan 5.2 software.Results: A total of 9 studies were finally included consisting of 8 RCTs and involving 39 688 patients. The result of meta-analysis showed that: a) for safety, the incidence of injection adverse reaction (swelling and red spots) in vaccine group was higher than that in placebo group (RR=1.22, 95%CI 1.13 to 1.32, P<0.000 01); while the incidences of systemic adverse reaction (RR=1.03, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.07, P=0.1) and serious adverse reaction (RR=1.06, 95%CI 0.75 to 1.50, P=0.74) were alike between the two groups; and b) for immunogenicity, the serum antibody seroconversion rates in the vaccine group (including subtypes of HPV6, HPV11 HPV16 and HPV18) were all higher than those in the placebo group, with significant differences.Conclusion: Compared with placebo, quadrivalent HPV vaccine has relatively high incidences of adverse reaction and high-degree immunogenicity, which can be widely used in the prevention of relevant diseases of human papillomavirus infection among adolescents. The main adverse reaction is local dysfunction, which is well tolerated, so the vaccine can be safely used.

Our aim was to carry out a meta-analysis investigating the possible association between the use of proton pump inhibitors or H2-receptor antagonists and SBP. Methods We searched several databases from inception through 15 December 2014 to identify observational studies that provided data on the association of gastric acid suppression with SBP as their primary outcome, and carried out random effects meta-analyses. Results Fourteen observational studies (six case-control and eight cohort) evaluating the association between proton pump inhibitors and SBP revealed a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.32 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.57-3.42, I2= 82%]. The subgroup analysis based on study design revealed a pooled OR of 2.52 (95% CI 1.71-3.71, I2=16%) for case-control studies, and a pooled OR of 2.18 (95% CI 1.24-3.82, I2= 89%) for cohort studies. Sensitivity analysis including only the peer-reviewed publications in the cohort subgroup revealed a pooled OR of 1.49 (95% CI 1.15-1.95, I2=27%). The subgroup analysis for highquality studies revealed a pooled OR of 1.49 (95% CI 1.19-1.88, I2= 21%). The pooled OR for H2-receptor antagonists and SBP was 1.93 (95% CI 1.15-3.24, I2= 0%). Conclusions There appear to be statistically significant, but quantitatively small, associations between gastric acid suppression and SBP. However, the magnitude of the possible association diminished when analysis focused on higher quality data that were more robust. Furthermore, the quality evidence in support of the association, as per the GRADE framework, was very low. Copyright ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

However, 30% of patients with ET do not respond to either propranolol or primidone. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate for ET. We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant randomized controlled trials on the effects of topiramate for ET. A meta-analysis technique was applied to estimate the efficacy and safety of topiramate. The primary outcome was the change in the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale (TRS). The secondary outcomes included the respective change in the location, motor tasks/function and function disability scores, and adverse events. We included 3 randomized controlled trials with a total of 294 participants. Topiramate was significantly better than placebo in reducing TRS of patients with ET (mean difference [MD]-8.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]-15.46 to-1.70). Changes from the scales of upper limb tremor severity (MD-5.12, 95% CI-7.79 to-2.45), motor tasks/function (MD-5.07, 95% CI-7.12 to-3.03), and functional disability (MD-4.72, 95% CI-6.77 to-2.67) were significantly greater with topiramate than with placebo. More participants taking topiramate experienced adverse events leading to withdrawal than those taking placebo (risk difference 19%, 95% CI 11%-27%). There is consistent evidence supporting the efficacy of topiramate in treating ET; however, a significant proportion of participants withdrew due to its adverse effects.

Because most of these studies were performed in China, Chinese published clinical studies were used for the analysis. A search for studies from 2006 to 2013 of regimens containing HHT for AML treatment was performed using published studies and Chinese databases in Mandarin. The complete response (CR) and overall response (OR) rates were analyzed, and the fixed effects model and random effects model (REM) were calculated. The heterogeneity of the studies was calculated using Q homogeneity statistics. The metaanalysis included 21 studies (n = 1310, n = 229 pediatric, and n = 216 elderly). HHT was given in combination with cytarabine, daunorubicin, idarubicin, aclacinomycin, mitoxantrone, or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Heterogeneity was seen in all analyzed pools, but it was most pronounced in retrospective studies. Overall, the REM showed a CR rate of 65.2%. However, in studies in which HHT-containing regimens were compared to regimens without HHT, the CR rates were 69.1% in randomized trials and 62.8% in retrospective studies. Additionally, in studies with exclusively elderly patients, the CR rate was considerably lower than it was for the studies with mixed age populations (47.5% vs. 65.2%). Higher overall CR rates for HHT-containing regimens in AML treatment in the Chinese studies suggest that HHT could be an active agent in the management of AML. Additional clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of HHT in AML treatment. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc."

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Main outcome measures: Pain and physical function. Data sources: Systematic searches for benefits and harms were carried out in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to August 2014. Only studies published in 2000 or later were included for harms. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised controlled trials assessing benefit of arthroscopic surgery involving partial meniscectomy, debridement, or both for patients with or without radiographic signs of osteoarthritis were included. For harms, cohort studies, register based studies, and case series were also allowed. Results: The search identified nine trials assessing the benefits of knee arthroscopic surgery in middle aged and older patients with knee pain and degenerative knee disease. The main analysis, combining the primary endpoints of the individual trials from three to 24 months postoperatively, showed a small difference in favour of interventions including arthroscopic surgery compared with control treatments for pain (effect size 0.14, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.26). This difference corresponds to a benefit of 2.4 (95% confidence interval 0.4 to 4.3) mm on a 0-100 mm visual analogue scale. When analysed over time of follow-up, interventions including arthroscopy showed a small benefit of 3-5 mm for pain at three and six months but not later up to 24 months. No significant benefit on physical function was found (effect size 0.09, -0.05 to 0.24). Nine studies reporting on harms were identified. Harms included symptomatic deep venous thrombosis (4.13 (95% confidence interval 1.78 to 9.60) events per 1000 procedures), pulmonary embolism, infection, and death. Conclusions: The small inconsequential benefit seen from interventions that include arthroscopy for the degenerative knee is limited in time and absent at one to two years after surgery. Knee arthroscopy is associated with harms. Taken together, these findings do not support the practise of arthroscopic surgery for middle aged or older patients with knee pain with or without signs of osteoarthritis. ? Br J Sports Med 2015."

The authors sought to identify all prospective clinical studies reporting complications associated with lumbar open microdiscectomy, microendoscopic discectomy (MED), and percutaneous microdiscectomy. Methods The authors conducted MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase database searches for randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies reporting complications associated with open, microendoscopic, or percutaneous lumbar microdiscectomy. Studies with fewer than 10 patients and published before 1990 were excluded. Overall and interstudy median complication rates were calculated for each surgical technique. The authors also performed a meta-analysis of the reported complications to assess statistical significance across the various surgical techniques. Results Of 9504 articles retrieved from the databases, 42 met inclusion criteria. Most studies screened were retrospective case series, limiting the number of studies that could be included. A total of 9 complication types were identified in the included studies, and these were analyzed across each of the surgical techniques. The rates of any complication across the included studies were 12.5%, 13.3%, and 10.8% for open, MED, and percutaneous microdiscectomy, respectively. New or worsening neurological deficit arose in 1.3%, 3.0%, and 1.6% of patients, while direct nerve root injury occurred at rates of 2.6%, 0.9%, and 1.1%, respectively. Hematoma was reported at rates of 0.5%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Wound complications (infection, dehiscence, or seroma) occurred at rates of 2.1%, 1.2%, and 0.5%, respectively. The rates of recurrent disc complications were 4.4%, 3.1%, and 3.9%, while reoperation was indicated in 7.1%, 3.7%, and 10.2% of operations, respectively. Meta-analysis calculations revealed a statistically significant higher rate of intraoperative nerve root injury following percutaneous procedures relative to MED. No other significant differences were found. Conclusions This review highlights complication rates among various microdiscectomy techniques, which likely reflect real-world practice and conceptualization of complications among physicians.

Procalcitonin values rise initially as the infection sets in and eventually fall with resolution. Its level has been reported to be significantly higher in potential nonsurvivors of a septic episode than among survivors. However, there is also a significant amount of evidence against this. We thus conducted a meta-analysis to pool data from all the available studies regarding PCT levels in survivors and nonsurvivors of sepsis. An extensive literature search was conducted using the key words ''procalcitonin,'' ''sepsis,'' and ''prognosis.'' The references of the relevant studies were also scanned. The data from the eligible studies were extracted and analyzed for any significant pooled mean difference between survivors and nonsurvivors both on days 1 and 3. The mean difference in the day 1 PCT values between survivors and nonsurvivors was found to be statistically significant (P = 0.02). The mean difference on day 3 was also statistically significant (P = 0.002). However, in a subgroup consisting of studies on patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, day 1 difference was not found to be significant (P = 0.62).

Pneumococcal vaccination (PV) could protect subjects from cardiovascular events by reducing pneumonia severity or even preventing it. We sought to determine the ability of PV to protect from the risk of cardiovascular events. Methods and results A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted up to March 2014. Cohort studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were included. Eleven studies were included (332,267 participants, mean follow-up 20.1 months).

Protective ability was more prominent in high cardiovascular risk populations and with older age. The protective role of PV was attenuated after 1 year (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59-0.88 vs RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.93-1.14; p = 0.002, for follow-up >1 year vs ?1 year, respectively). It also increased as the presence of cardiovascular and pulmonary disease increased.

Conclusion PV is associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. This protective effect increases at older age and in high cardiovascular risk subjects and decreases as the time elapses from PV.

Methods Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science and PubMed electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant articles published before October 2013. A proportions meta-analysis was undertaken. Results One hundred and two articles were identified of which 49 were single patient case reports. Meta-analysis showed that mean age was 75 (95% CI 73, 77) years, 79% were women (95% CI 74, 82) and mean body mass index was 25 (95% CI 20, 30) kg m-2. Presentation with thiazide-induced hyponatraemia occurred a mean of 19 (95% CI 8, 30) days after starting treatment, with mean trough serum sodium concentration of 116 (95% CI 113, 120) mm and serum potassium of 3.3 (95% CI 3.0, 3.5) mm. Mean urinary sodium concentration was 64 mm (95% CI 47, 81). The most frequently reported drugs were hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide and bendroflumethiazide. Conclusions Patients with thiazide-induced hyponatraemia were characterized by advanced age, female gender, inappropriate saliuresis and mild hypokalaemia. Low BMI was not found to be a significant risk factor, despite previous suggestions. The time from thiazide initiation to presentation with hyponatraemia suggests that the recommended practice of performing a single investigation of serum biochemistry 7-14 days after thiazide initiation may be insufficient or suboptimal.

Meta-analyses indicated that FSW in the post-intervention period were 2.3-5.0 times more likely to use condoms with male clients in their last sexual act and 2.3-3.4 times more likely to use condoms consistently in the last month than in the pre-intervention period. In particular, multiple session intervention were more effective in improving condom use among FSW with male clients (OR=5.6, [4.0-7.8]) than a single session intervention (OR=3.3, [2.8-3.8]). Behavioral interventions also improved past-12-month HIV testing uptake 4.6-fold (95% CI, 2.9-7.4). Comprehensive intervention programs were more effective (OR=8.1, [4.0-16.7]) in improving HIV testing uptake compared with health education only programs (OR=2.7, [1.6-4.5]). Longer intervention duration (>12 months) did not increase effectiveness in improving condom use or HIV testing rate among Chinese FSWs. Behavioral interventions are effective in improving condom use and HIV testing uptake among Chinese FSW. This review highlights both the potentials and limitations of condom promotion interventions targeting female sex workers. ? Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015."

This study aimed to update current evidence and to evaluate the effects of surgery on quality of life in patients with refractory epilepsy. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature were conducted and selected studies included 2 groups of refractory epilepsy patients, surgical and nonsurgical. The studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcome was the seizure-free rate. The secondary outcome was quality of life. Adverse events were also reviewed. After screening, a total of 20 studies were selected: 8 were interventional, including 2 randomized controlled trials, and 12 were observational. All of the studies comprised 1959 patients with refractory epilepsy. The seizure-free rates were significantly higher for patients who received surgery compared with the patients who did not; the combined odds ratio was 19.35 (95% CI=12.10-30.95, P<0.001). After adjusting for publication bias the combined odds ratio was 10.25 (95% CI=5.84-18.00). In both the interventional and observational studies, patients treated surgically had a significantly better quality of life compared with the patients not treated surgically. Complications were listed in 3 studies and the rates were similar in surgical and nonsurgical patients. Our meta-analysis found that for patients with refractory epilepsy, surgical treatment appears to provide a much greater likelihood of seizure-free outcome than nonsurgical treatment, although there is a need for more studies, particularly randomized studies, to confirm this conclusion. Based on more limited data, surgical treatment also appeared to provide a better quality of life and did not seem to increase complications. Copyright ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The risk factors for IASCs still remain controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors for IASCs in CD patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Methods: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE were searched to identify observational studies reporting the risk factors for IASCs in CD patients. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of various risk factors on IASCs in CD. The GRADE [Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation] approach was used for quality assessment of evidence on outcome levels. Results: This review included 15 studies evaluating 3807 patients undergoing 4189 operations. The meta-analyses found that low albumin levels (odds ratio [OR]: 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.362.75), preoperative steroids use [OR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.54-2.57], a preoperative abscess [OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.263.0], previous surgery history [OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.151.97] may be risk factors for IASCs. There were no associations between anastomosis methods [OR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.58- 1.53], biologics therapy [OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.792.11], and immunomodulator use [OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.661.73] with the risk of IASCs. Due to observational design, the quality of evidence was regarded low or moderate for these risk factors by the GRADE approach. Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides some evidence that steroids use, previous surgical history, a preoperative abscess, and low albumin levels may be associated with higher rates of IASCs in CD. Knowledge about those risk factors may influence treatment and procedure-related decisions, and possibly reduce the ss rate. ? 2015 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,2015,HIP International,10.5301/hipint.5000223,25684252,"The outcomes of using a ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) vs ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) bearing surface for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) are much debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to compare and evaluate the outcomes of these 2 bearing surfaces. Materials and Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, CENTRAL, Embase and Web of Science) were systematically searched for RCTs investigating the association between bearing surfaces and outcomes following primary THA. Two investigators independently reviewed studies for eligibility, assessed the risk of bias, extracted and analysed the data. Results: In total, 13 RCTs including a total of 2,488 THAs were identified. The Harris Hip Score appeared to be similar between CoC and CoP THAs. The acetabular liner wear rate was lower in CoC than CoP THA, but the meta-analysis showed that the incidence of component-related noise and overall ceramic fracture in CoC group were 14.73 times and 6.02 times higher than CoP THA, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in rates of radiolucent line formation (>1 mm), osteolysis, loosening, revision with follow-up > 5 years, intraoperative femoral fracture, dislocation, deep infection, deep venous thrombosis and leg length discrepancy between CoC and CoP THAs. Conclusions: There appears to be no clear evidence favouring the use of either a CoC or CoP bearing surfaces in primary THA, further studies with high-quality and longer term follow-up to provide more evidence on this topic are still required. ? 2015 Wichtig Publishing."

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2015,Respirology,10.1111/resp.12597,26177049,"This review aimed to investigate whether chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). EMBASE, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for cohort studies and case-control studies investigating the impact of COPD on CAP. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and need for mechanical ventilation. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The Mantel-Haenszel method and inverse variance method were used to calculate pooled relative risks (RRs) and mean differences (MD), respectively. Eleven studies (nine cohort studies and two case-control studies), involving 257 958 patients, were included. The overall methodological quality was high. COPD was not associated with increased mortality in hospitalized CAP patients (RR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-1.56; P = 0.19; I2 = 55%) in cohort studies, and was associated with reduced mortality in case-control studies (RR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74-0.90; P < 0.0001; I2 = 80%). COPD was not associated with longer hospital stay (MD, 0.11; 95% CI: -0.42 to 0.64; P = 0.68; I2 = 21%), more frequent ICU admission (RR, 0.97; 95% CI: 0.70-1.35; P = 0.87; I2 = 65%), and more need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.71-1.16; P = 0.44; I2 = 4%).The current available evidence indicates that COPD may not be associated with increased mortality and morbidity in patients hospitalized with CAP.

Aim To investigate the efficacy and safety of a second anti-TNF agent after primary/secondary failure or intolerance to a first drug. Methods Inclusion criteria: studies evaluating the efficacy of infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA) and certolizumab-pegol (CZP) as the second anti-TNF in CD or UC. Search strategy: Bibliographical searches (PubMed/Embase). Data synthesis: percentage of response/remission; the meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method. Results We included 46 studies (37 CD, 8 UC, 1 pouchitis). The CD studies comprised 32 switching IFX¡÷ADA, 4 IFX¡÷CZP and 1 ADA¡÷IFX. Overall, the second anti-TNF after the failure of IFX in CD induced remission in 43% and response in 63% of patients. The remission rate was higher when the reason to withdraw the first anti-TNF was intolerance (61%) than after secondary (45%) or primary failure (30%); response rates were, respectively, 72%, 62% and 53%. All UC studies switched IFX¡÷ADA, six of them reporting remission rates ranging from 0% to 50%. Adverse events rate ranged from 0% to 81% in CD, most of them mild (serious adverse event 0-21%, discontinuation rate <20%). Conclusions The efficacy of a second anti-TNF in CD patients largely depends on the cause for switching. The remission rate is higher when the reason to withdraw the first anti-TNF is intolerance (61%), compared with secondary (45%) or primary failure (30%). Further studies of switch ADA¡÷IFX are needed to evaluate this strategy. PROSPERO-registry-number: CRD42014012943. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Methods: Studies were selected from MEDLINE up to March 2014. Two investigators independently extracted data on study design, patient characteristics, clinical features (AIHA type, disease duration, previous treatments), dose-schedule of rituximab, duration of treatment follow-up, and toxicities. Pooled overall response rate (ORR) and complete response (CR) rates were evaluated to determine RTX efficacy and toxicity by calculating the weighted mean proportion with fixed or random-effects models in case of heterogeneity (p&lt;0.1 or I2&gt;50%). Results: Twenty-one studies encompassing 409 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The characteristics of the entire analyzed cohort reported were as follows: mean male proportion: 43%, mean age: 50. years, splenectomized patients range: 0. -50%. Warm AIHA, primary AIHA and adults were mostly represented. With the random-effect model, the overall response rate (ORR) was 73% (95% CI 64-81%, 20 studies encompassing 402 patients). CR rate was 37% (95% CI 26-49%, 20 studies including 397 patients). The ORRs were close to 70% for warm AIHA (79%, 95% CI 60-90%, 11 studies, 154 patients), primary AIHA (67%, 95% CI 49-81%, 10 studies, 161 patients), and secondary AIHA (72%, 95% CI 60-82%, 8 studies, 66 patients). The ORR was 57% (95% CI 47-66%, 6 studies, 109 patients) for cold agglutinin disease (CAD). The CR rate was 42% (95% CI 27-58%, 11 studies, 154 patients) for warm AHAI, 32% (95% CI 17-51%, 11 studies, 176 patients) for primary AIHA, 46% (95% CI 30-62%, 9 studies, 87 patients) for secondary AIHA and only 21% (95% CI 6-51%, 7 studies, 118 patients) for CAD.Definitive response rates were evaluated during follow-up. CR rate was the highest within 2 to 4. months after RTX (13 studies, 203 patients, CR. =. 70% [57-80%]). As for toxicities, 38 adverse events in 364 patients were noted (14% (95% CI 9-21%)). Sixteen events were infusion-linked side effects, mostly chills and fever, whereas twenty-two were severe. Only one opportunistic Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia was reported. Seventeen patients out of 364 (4.6%) died during follow-up.In univariate mixed-effect meta-regressions, ORR and CR were significantly associated with warm AIHA (. p=. 0.002) and mean age (. p&lt;. 0.001), and marginally associated with disease type (. p=. 0.06 and 0.005, respectively). Conclusions: Rituximab seems to be a safe and effective therapy for AIHA in this meta-analysis of observational studies. The authors suggest that it could be used at an earlier point in therapy, before more toxic immunosuppressive drugs, or in place of splenectomy in some cases. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V."

To date, the etiology of childhood leukemia remains largely unknown. Few risk factors (genetic susceptibility, infections, ionizing radiation, etc.) have been clearly identified, but they appear to explain only a small proportion of cases. Considerably more uncertain is the role of other environmental risk factors, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution. We sought to summarize and quantify the association between traffic-related air pollution and risk of childhood leukemia, and further examined results according to method of exposure assessment, study quality, leukemia subtype, time period, and continent where studies took place. After a literature search yielded 6 ecologic and 20 case-control studies, we scored the studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The studies assessed residential exposure to pollutants from motorized traffic by computing traffic density in the neighboring roads or vicinity to petrol stations, or by using measured or modeled nitrogen dioxide and benzene outdoor air levels. Because heterogeneity across studies was observed, random-effects summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Whenever possible we additionally conducted stratified analyses comparing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Limiting the analysis to high-quality studies (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale ? 7), those using traffic density as the exposure assessment metric showed an increase in childhood leukemia risk in the highest exposure category (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.24). However, we observed evidence of publication bias. Results for NO<inf>2</inf> exposure and benzene showed an OR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.97-1.52) and 1.64 (95% CI 0.91-2.95) respectively. When stratifying by leukemia type, the results based upon NO<inf>2</inf> were 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.41) for ALL and 1.06 (95% CI 0.51-2.21) for AML; based upon benzene were 1.09 (95% CI 0.67-1.77) for ALL and 2.28 (95% CI 1.09-4.75) for AML. Estimates were generally higher for exposures in the postnatal period compared to the prenatal period, and for European studies compared to North American studies. Overall, our results support a link between ambient exposure to traffic pollution and childhood leukemia risk, particularly due to benzene. Copyright ? 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Method: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Healthcare databases and sources of grey literature were searched up to 2012 and records screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed using a piloted form. Results were synthesised narratively and we undertook meta-analyses to calculate pooled estimates of effect, statistical heterogeneity and assessed publication bias. Findings: Nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and eight observational studies met the inclusion criteria. Neuraminidase inhibitors provided 67 to 89% protection for individuals following prophylaxis. Meta-analysis of individual protection showed a significantly lower pooled odds of laboratory confirmed seasonal or influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection following oseltamivir usage compared to placebo or no therapy (n=8 studies; odds ratio (OR)=0.11; 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.06 to 0.20; p<0.001; I2558.7%). This result was comparable to the pooled odds ratio for individual protection with zanamivir (OR=0.23; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.35). Similar point estimates were obtained with widely overlapping 95% CIs for household protection with oseltamivir or zanamivir. We found no studies of neuraminidase inhibitors to prevent population-wide community transmission of influenza. Conclusion: Oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective for prophylaxis of individuals and households irrespective of treatment of the index case. There are no data which directly support an effect on wider community transmission."

Pooled estimates for the outcome of interest were acquired using random effects metaanalysis.Subjects: The study population included individuals receiving ART before or during TB treatment. Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures were: (i) TB-case fatality ratio (CFR), defined as the proportion of individuals dying during TB treatment, if mortality in HIV-positive people not on ART was also reported, (ii) the relative risk of death during TB treatment by ART status.Results: Twenty-one studies were included in the systematic review.

The safety of such injections has been questioned as they may increase infection rates in subsequent arthroplasty. We carried out a meta-analysis of studies examining the relation between intra-articular steroid injections and infection rates in subsequent joint arthroplasty. A literature search was undertaken. Eight studies looking at hip and knee arthroplasties were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed that steroid injection had no significant effect on either deep (risk ratio=1.87; 95% CI 0.80-4.35; P=0.15) or superficial infection rates (risk ratio=1.75; 95% CI 0.76-4.04; P=0.19) of subsequent arthroplasty. Further large cohort studies would be of value in further examining whether steroid injections close to the time of arthroplasty are safe. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Most European countries offer HPV vaccination for girls, but vaccine recommendations for boys are warranted. Aims: The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence of genital HPV, identify parameters that affect the prevalence, and describe the type-specific prevalence among men in Europe. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature in PubMed and Embase. Main Outcome Measures: Genital HPV prevalence and factors influencing prevalence in general and high-risk male populations in Europe. Results: We included 31 articles that gave the prevalence of genital HPV DNA among men in northern, southern and western Europe; no studies from eastern Europe were identified. The pooled HPV prevalence among 1,863 men representing the general population (nine studies) was 12.4%, with large heterogeneity between studies (I2=96.3%, P&lt;0.0001). The pooled HPV prevalence among 6,428 men in the high-risk population (22 studies) was 30.9%, also with substantial heterogeneity (I2=95.6%, P&lt;0.0001). In unadjusted meta-regression analysis, the HPV prevalence in the general population was significantly higher in studies published after 2000 (28.5%) than in earlier studies (8.8%) (P=0.0179). In the meta-regression analysis adjusted by publication year, the heterogeneity in the two population groups could not be explained by geographical region, anatomical sampling site, or HPV detection method. HPV16 was the most prevalent high-risk type in both populations. Conclusions: HPV prevalence differs in male general and high-risk populations, but HPV16 and HPV18 are among the most common HPV types detected in both groups. Our findings contribute knowledge that may be useful as a baseline measure before the introduction of HPV vaccination for boys in Europe, and add to understanding of the epidemiology of HPV infection in men.

The applied effectiveness of treatment as a prevention strategy in China is still under investigation, and much less is known about its effects in the presence of other prevention strategies such as consistent condom use. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and three Chinese language databases to identify relevant articles for the estimation of relative effectiveness of a) consistent condom use and b) ART use by index partners for preventing HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples. We also estimated the prevention effectiveness of ART stratified by condom use level and the prevention effectiveness of consistent condom use stratified by ART use level. Results: Pooled results from the eleven eligible studies found a pooled HIV seroconversion incidence of 0.92 cases per 100 person years (PY) among HIV-negative spouses whose index partners were taking ART versus 2.45 cases per 100 PY in untreated couples. The IRR comparing seroconversion in couples where the index-partner was on ART versus not on ART was 0.47 (95%CI: 0.43, 0.52), while stratified by condom use, the IRR was 0.33(0.17,0.64). The IRR comparing incidence in couples reporting ""consistent condom use"" versus those reporting otherwise was 0.02(95%CI:0.01,0.04), after stratified by ART use level, the IRR was 0.01(95%CI: 0.00, 0.06). Conclusions: ART use by index partners could reduce HIV transmission in serodiscordant couples, and the effectiveness of this prevention strategy could be further increased with consistent condom use. ? 2014 Liu et al.

Pylori antibodies, and a risk-prediction model based on these two tests. To investigate whether these tests accurately predict gastric cancer development, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: PubMed and other electronic databases were searched for cohort studies published in English or Japanese from January 1985 through December 2013. Six reviewers identified eligible studies, and at least two investigators extracted data on population and study-design characteristics, quality items, and outcomes of interest. Meta-analyses were performed on non-overlapping studies. Results: Nine prospective cohorts from Eastern Asia reported in 12 publications, including 33,741 asymptomatic middle-aged participants of gastric cancer screening, were eligible. For discriminating between asymptomatic adults at high and low risk of gastric cancer, the pepsinogen test (summary hazard ratio [HR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7-4.7; I2 = 0%) and H. pylori antibodies (summary HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.0-5.2; I2 = 0%) were statistically significant predictors as standalone tests. Although the risk-prediction model was in general moderately accurate in separating asymptomatic adults into four risk groups (summary c-statistic, 0.71; 95% CI: 0.68-0.73; I2 = 7%), calibration seemed to be poor. The study validity was generally limited. Conclusions: The serum pepsinogen test, H. pylori antibodies, and the four-risk-group model for predicting gastric cancer development seem to have the potential to stratify middle-aged presumptively healthy adults. Future research needs to focus on comparative studies to evaluate the impact of screening programs adopting these tests. Also, validation, preferably with model updating, is necessary to see whether the current model performance is transferable to different populations. ? 2014 Terasawa et al."

However, mTOR inhibitors are also associated with a range of side effects, including metabolic complications. We aimed to determine the risks of metabolic complications after the conversion from CNI to mTOR inhibitor postkidney transplant. A systematic search in PubMed up to September 2013 identified nine relevant trials (a total of 2323 patients). The primary end points were the relative risks (RRs) of new-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) and hypercholesterolemia. The overall RRs of NODAT and hypercholesterolemia associated with mTOR inhibitors were 1.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.87) and 2.15 (95% CI 1.35-3.41), respectively, compared with CNI-based regimen. Subgroup analyses revealed no differences in the incidence of NODAT or hypercholesterolemia between sirolimus-versus everolimus-based regimen, or between early versus late conversion. Analyses of secondary outcomes revealed a higher risk of acute rejection, proteinuria and anemia, but no difference in the risk of opportunistic infections after mTOR inhibitor conversion. In conclusion, the conversion from CNI to mTOR inhibitor in low-to-moderate risk kidney transplant recipients was associated with nonsignificant trend toward increased risk of NODAT and significant increase in hypercholesterolemia, acute rejection, proteinuria and anemia. ? 2014 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons."

However, the efficacy and safety of this therapy are controversial. Objectives: To determine whether ecabet sodium improves the eradication rate of H. pylori and examine treatment safety by conducting a meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Literature searches were conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Science Citation Index, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, and the Wanfang Database. A meta-analysis of all RCTs comparing ecabet sodium supplementation with nonecabet sodium-containing therapy was performed. Results: Thirteen RCTs that included a total of 1808 patients were assessed. The meta-analysis showed that the eradication rate in the ecabet sodium-containing quadruple therapy group was higher than that in the standard triple therapy group (84.5% vs 74.55%, OR 1.757 (95%CI: 1.307 to 2.362), p < .001). The analysis also showed that the eradication rate in the ecabet sodium-containing triple therapy group was significantly higher than that in the PPI plus amoxicillin or clarithromycin therapy group (74.6% vs 43.9%,OR 3.727 (95%CI: 2.320 to 5.988), p < .001)(ITT), (74.6% vs 43.9%,OR 3.863 (95%CI: 2.369 to 6.298), p < .001) (PP). Furthermore, our meta-analysis suggested that the occurrence of side effects did not significantly differ between patients receiving ecabet sodium-containing therapy and patients receiving nonecabet sodium-containing therapy (14.0% vs 13.3%, OR 1.055 (95%CI: 0.632 to 1.759), p = .839). Conclusion: Supplementation with ecabet sodium during H. pylori eradication therapy improves the eradication rate. The use of ecabet sodium does not increase the side effects based on our meta-analysis. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The risk of these complications may vary in different patient groups.Aim: To estimate the incidence and predictors of HCC and in untreated HBV patients.Methods: Systematic review with random effects meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results are expressed as annual incidence (events per 100 person-years) with 95% confidence intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses of patient and study characteristics were performed to identify common risk factors.Results: We included 68 trials and studies with a total of 27,584 patients (264,919 person-years). In total, 1,285 of 26,687 (5%) patients developed HCC and 730 of 12,511 (6%) patients died. The annual incidence was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.76-0.99) for HCC and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.01-1.51) for mortality. Patients with cirrhosis had a higher risk of HCC (incidence 3.16; 95% CI, 2.58- 3.74) than patients without cirrhosis (0.10; 95% CI, 0.02-0.18). The risk of dying was also higher for patients with than patients without cirrhosis (4.89; 95% CI, 3.16-6.63; and 0.11; 95% CI, 0.09-0.14). The risk of developing HCC increased with HCV coinfection, older age and inflammatory activity. The country of origin did not clearly predict HCC or mortality estimates.Conclusions: Cirrhosis was the strongest predictor of HCC incidence and mortality. Patients with HBV cirrhosis have a 31-fold increased risk of HCC and a 44-fold increased mortality compared to non-cirrhotic patients. The low incidence rates should be taken into account when considering HCC screening in non-cirrhotic patients. ? 2014 Thiele et al."

Medline and Scopus were searched from their beginning to November 2013 to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SSI and length of stay between DPC and PC. Studies' selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were done by two independent authors. The risk ratio and unstandardised mean difference were pooled for SSI and length of stay, respectively. Among 8 eligible studies, 5 studies were done in complicated appendicitis, 2 with mixed complicated appendicitis and other types of abdominal operation and 1 with ileostomy closure. Most studies (75%) had high risk of bias in sequence generation and allocation concealment. Among 6 RCTs of complicated appendicitis underwent open appendectomy, the SSI between PC and DPC were not significantly different with a risk ratio of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.73). DPC had a significantly 1.6?days (95% CI: 1.41, 1.79) longer length of stay than PC. Our evidence suggested there might be no advantage of DPC over PC in reducing SSI in complicated appendicitis.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Caesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery, prevents HBV transmission. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Two investigators independently searched PubMed, EMBASE and other databases for relevant studies published between 1988 and 2013. A manual search of relevant topics and major conferences for abstracts was also conducted. Randomized trials, cohort and case-control studies assessing the effect of delivery mode on vertical transmission of HBV were included. Studies assessing antiviral therapy and patients with coinfection were excluded. The primary outcome was HBV transmission rates according to delivery method. RESULTS: Of the 430 studies identified, 10 were included. Caesarean section decreased the odds of HBV transmission by 38% compared with vaginal delivery (OR 0.62 [95% CI 0.40 to 0.98]; P=0.04) based on a random-effects model. Significant heterogeneity among studies was found (I2=63%; P=0.003), which was largely explained by variation in hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) administration. Meta-regression showed a significant linear association between the percentage of infants receiving HBIG per study and the log OR (P=0.005), with the least benefit observed in studies with 100% HBIG administration. Subgroup analysis of hepatitis B e-antigen-positive women who underwent Caesarean section did not show a significant reduction in vertical transmission. DISCUSSION: Caesarean section may protect against HBV transmission; however, convincing benefit could not be demonstrated due to significant study heterogeneity from variable HBIG administration, highlighting the importance of HBIG in HBV prevention. CONCLUSION: More high-quality studies are needed before any recommendations can be made. ?2014 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved."

Some reports suggest that fetuses exposed to cotrimoxazole during early pregnancy may have an increased risk of congenital anomalies. We carried out this systematic review to update the evidence of cotrimoxazole safety in pregnancy. METHODS: Three databases and 1 conference abstract site were searched in duplicate up to October 31, 2013, for studies reporting adverse maternal and infant outcomes among women receiving cotrimoxazole during pregnancy. This search was updated in MEDLINE via PubMed to April 28, 2014. Studies were included irrespective of HIV infection status or the presence of other coinfections. Our primary outcome was birth defects of any kind. Secondary outcomes included spontaneous abortions, terminations of pregnancy, stillbirths, preterm deliveries, and drug-associated toxicity. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included for review. There were 232 infants with congenital anomalies among 4196 women receiving cotrimoxazole during pregnancy, giving an overall pooled prevalence of 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 1.8% to 5.1%; £n = 0.03). Three studies reported 31 infants with neural tube defects associated with first trimester exposure to cotrimoxazole, giving a crude prevalence of 0.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.5% to 1.0%) with most data (29 neural tube defects) coming from a single study. The majority of adverse drug reactions were mild. The quality of the evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review support continued recommendations for cotrimoxazole as a priority intervention for HIV-infected pregnant women.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic evidence search protocol was applied to 7 bibliographic databases. Studies examining the reliability and/or validity of depression assessment tools were selected for inclusion if they were based on the data collected from HIV-positive adults in any African member state of the United Nations. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled estimates of depression prevalence. In a subgroup of studies of criterion-related validity, the bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Of 1117 records initially identified, I included 13 studies of 5373 persons with HIV in 7 sub-Saharan African countries. Reported estimates of Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.63 to 0.95, and analyses of internal structure generally confirmed the existence of a depression-like construct accounting for a substantial portion of variance. The pooled prevalence of probable depression was 29.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 20.5 to 39.4], whereas the pooled prevalence of major depressive disorder was 13.9% (95% CI: 9.7 to 18.6). The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was the most frequently studied instrument, with a pooled sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.87) for detecting major depressive disorder.

The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of existing head to head studies to compare the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 analogues with DPP-4 inhibitors. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head studies to compare GLP-1 analogues with DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of type 2 diabetes. A random effects model was selected to perform the meta-analyses, results were expressed as weighted mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risks for dichotomous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals, and with I2 values and P values as markers of heterogeneity. Results: Four head-to-head randomized controlled studies with 1755 patients were included. Compared to sitagliptin, GLP-1 analogues are more effective in reducing HbA1C (weight mean difference -0.41%, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.31) and body weight (weight mean difference -1.55 kg, 95% CI -1.98 to -1.12). Conversely, GLP-1 analogues are associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events compared to sitagliptin: nausea (relative risk 3.14, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.59), vomiting (relative risk 2.60, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.56), diarrhea (relative risk 1.82, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.69), and constipation (relative risk 2.50, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.70). Conclusions: The result of this meta-analysis demonstrates that compared to sitagliptin, GLP-1 analogues are more effective for glycemic control and weight loss, but have similar efficacy in reducing blood pressure and lipid parameters, however, GLP-1 analogues are associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and a similar incidence of hypoglycemia compared to sitagliptin. ? 2014 Wang et al."

Results: Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for the study. Four of the studies included chronic or diabetic lower extremity wounds and four included fractures. In three of four studies reporting on fractures, the wounds were not closed post-operatively, whereas in one study primary closure of the wound was performed. With regard to wounds left open after the stabilization of fractures, patients whose wounds were treated with VAC developed fewer SSIs than those whose wounds were treated without VAC ([367 patients (196 with VAC; 171 without VAC) relative risk [RR], 0.47; 95% CI 0.28-0.81]). On the contrary, no difference in the development of SSIs occurred among patients with chronic or diabetic lower-extremity wounds treated with VAC and those whose wounds were treated without VAC ([638 patients (320 with VAC; 318 without VAC) RR 1.67; 95% CI: 0.71-3.94]).

Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases were used. The search included publications up to June 2013. Article selection was independently performed by 2 authors and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Study Selection: Studies meeting criteria for inclusion were observational cohort studies or randomized controlled trials evaluating functional and radiographic outcomes and complications in elderly patients treated for distal humerus fractures with either primary TEA or ORIF with locking plates. Studies with mean age <60 years, indications for TEA other than acute fracture, and those including nonlocked plates were excluded. Data Extraction: Standardized data extraction was performed. A quality assessment tool was used to evaluate individual study methodology. Data Synthesis: Descriptive statistics for functional outcomes were reported. Meta-analysis and regression analysis were performed for complication rates. Conclusions: A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that TEA and ORIF for the treatment of geriatric distal humerus fractures produced similar functional outcome scores and range of motion. Although there was a trend toward a higher rate of major complications and reoperation after ORIF, this was not statistically significant. The quality of study methodology was generally weak. Ongoing research including prospective trials and cost analysis is indicated to better define the roles of ORIF versus TEA in the management of these injuries.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the burden in this population compared with that of men in the general population to better inform future HIV prevention efforts. Methods: We searched seven electronic databases, national surveillance reports, and conference abstracts for studies of men who engage in transactional sex published between 2004-2013. Random effects meta-analysis was used to determine pooled HIV prevalence and prevalence ratios (PR) for the difference in HIV prevalence among men who engage in transactional sex as compared to general population men. Findings: Of 66 studies included representing 31,924 men who had engaged in transactional sex in 28 countries, pooled biological assay-confirmed HIV prevalence was 10.5% (95% CI = 9.4 to 11.5%). The highest pooled HIV prevalence was in Sub-Saharan Africa (31.5%, 95% CI = 21.6 to 41.5%), followed by Latin America (19.3%, 95% CI = 15.5 to 23.1%), North America (16.6%, 95% CI = 3.7 to 29.5%), and Europe (12.2%, 95% CI = 6.0 to 17.2%). Men who engaged in transactional sex had an elevated burden of HIV compared to the general male population (PR = 20.7, 95% CI = 16.8 to 25.5). Conclusions: The global burden of HIV is disproportionately high among men who engage in transactional sex compared with the general male population. There is an urgent need to include this population in systematic surveillance as well as to scale-up access to quality HIV prevention programs. ? 2014 Oldenburg et al."

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Association of Research in Vision and Ophthalmology abstracts were searched to identify studies investigating the serological association of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection with age-related macular degeneration. The quality of original studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Heterogeneity was explored with meta-regression. The odds ratios (ORs) and standardized mean differences (SMD) of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection between AMD patients and controls were pooled. Results: In total, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale scores ranging from 4 to 9. There was heterogeneity among studies due to a difference in the study designs and measurement of exposure to Chlamydia pneumoniae infection. The overall OR of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection with AMD was 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-1.57, P = 0.56). The overall SMD of antibody titer between AMD and control was 0.43 (95% confidence interval: -0.12 to 0.99, P = 0.13).

In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, CD4 count is not widely available or consistently used and instead the WHO clinical staging system is used to determine ART eligibility. However, concerns have been raised regarding its discriminatory ability to identify patients eligible to start ART. We therefore reviewed the accuracy of WHO stage 3 or 4 assessment in identifying ART eligibility according to CD4 count thresholds for ART initiation. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and Global Health databases and conference abstracts using a comprehensive strategy for studies that compared the results of WHO clinical staging with CD4 count thresholds. Studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English between 1998 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion according to our predefined study protocol. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were derived for each CD4 count threshold and hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 25,032 participants from 14 countries. Most studies assessed individuals attending ART clinics prior to treatment initiation. WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease had a sensitivity of 60% (95% CI: 45-73%, Q = 914.26, p &lt; 0.001) and specificity of 73% (95% CI: 60-83%, Q = 1439.43, p &lt; 0.001) for a CD4 threshold of ? 200 cells/mm3 (11 studies); sensitivity and specificity for a threshold of CD4 count ? 350 cells/mm3 were 45% (95% CI: 26-66%, Q = 1607.31, p &lt; 0.001) and 85% (95% CI: 69-93%, Q = 896.70, p &lt; 0.001), respectively (six studies). For the threshold of CD4 count ? 500 cells/mm3 sensitivity was 14% (95% CI: 13-15%) and specificity was 95% (95% CI: 94-96%) (one study). Conclusions: When used for individual treatment decisions, WHO clinical staging misses a high proportion of individuals who are ART eligible by CD4 count, with sensitivity falling as CD4 count criteria rises. Access to accurate, accessible, robust and affordable CD4 count testing methods will be a pressing need for as long as ART initiation decisions are based on criteria other than seropositivity. ? 2014 Munthali C et al; licensee International AIDS Society."

We conducted a meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of polymyxins for the treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii infection. Methods: We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CNKI, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up to November 1, 2013, to identify published studies, and we searched clinical trial registries to identify completed unpublished studies. Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Data were extracted on clinical response, microbiological response, mortality, length of stay and adverse events. Results: 12 controlled studies, comparing 677 patients, were included. Although clinical (odds ratio 1.421, 95% confidence interval 0.722-2.797) and microbiological (OR 1.416, 95% CI 0.369-5.425) response rates favored the polymyxins group, these differences were not significant. Treatment with polymyxins vs. controls did not affect hospital mortality (OR 0.506, 95% CI 0.101-2.536), lengths of hospital stay (standard mean difference -0.221, 95% CI 0.899-0.458) or nephrotoxicity (OR 1.192, 95% CI 0.436-3.261). The combination of polymyxins with other antibiotics achieved similar clinical response rates to its monotherapy regimen (OR 0.601, 95% CI 0.320-1.130).

However, the results were vulnerable to the removal of one key randomized controlled trial (RCT) because of insufficient data. Furthermore, recently published RCTs highlighted the need for an update of the SLR to challenge the robustness of results. Methods: The protocol for the new SLR included more stringent tests of robustness than used initially and the meta-analysis was updated with the results of two new RCTs as well as the count of patients and SSIs by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incision class. Results: The updated SLR included 15 RCTs with 4,800 patients. No publication bias was suggested in the analysis. The predominant effect estimated a relative risk of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84, p=0.00053) with an overall lower frequency of SSI in the TS arm than in the NTS arm. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: The two additional peer-reviewed double-blind RCTs of this update confirmed the predominant effect found in the authors' previous meta-analysis and established the robustness of conclusions that were lacking previously. This SLR and meta-analysis showed that the use of triclosan antimicrobial sutures reduced the incidence of SSI after clean, clean-contaminated, and contaminated surgery.

A comprehensive literature search of the electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was undertaken. The evidence base was critically appraised using a tool from the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group. Eight RCTs involving 641 patients were included. The use of fibrin sealant significantly reduced postoperative drainage (weighted mean difference (WMD) -346, 95% confidence interval (CI) -496.29 to -197.54, P < 0.00001) and blood transfusions (risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.63, P < 0.00001) and led to a significant improvement in the range of motion (WMD 16.59, 95% CI 6.92 to 26.25, P = 0.0008). However, using fibrin sealant did not significantly reduced total blood loss (WMD -305.25, 95% CI -679.44 to 68.95, P = 0.11). Regarding complications, there were no significant differences in any adverse events, fever, infection, or hematoma among the study groups.

DESIGN: We searched for English or Chinese articles using PubMed and EMBASE up to 28 February 2013. We aimed to identify randomised controlled trials and observational epidemiological studies that reported the association between domestic use of solid fuel and TB. Two reviewers independently extracted the information from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of these studies using pre-defined criteria. The effect sizes of eligible studies were pooled using a random-effects model; the heterogeneity across studies was quantified using I2 statistics. RESULTS: We identified 15 studies on solid fuel use and active TB and one on solid fuel use and latent tuberculous infection. The summary odds ratios from case-control and cross-sectional studies were respectively 1.17 (95%CI 0.83-1.65) and 1.62 (95%CI 0.89-2.93), with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 56.2% and 80.5%, respectively). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis did not identify any study-level factors that could explain the heterogeneity observed.

External (EXT-DCR) and endoscopic DCR (END-DCR) are both practiced. END-DCR was initially performed with laser (EL-DCR) but has shifted to careful bone removal with mechanical drills (EM-DCR). High level evidence from comparative cohorts was sought to compare outcomes. Method: Medline (1966 - January 28th, 2013) and Embase (1980 - January 28th, 2013) were searched for comparative studies (RCT/cohorts) of END-DCR to EXT-DCR for acquired nasolacrimal duct (NLD) obstruction. Primary outcome was DCR success, defined as resolution of symptoms and/or patent NLD on irrigation or dacroscintography. Secondary outcomes were scarring, infection and post-operative bleeding. Meta-analysis was performed with the Mantel-Haenszel Method and presented as Risk Ratios (RR) with Confidence Intervals (CI). Results: The search identified 3582 studies and 355 were reviewed after screening. Full text review yielded 19 studies (4 RCTs and 15 cohorts). Overall, EXT-DCR had slightly better success rates than END-DCR (RR 0.96, CI 0.93-1.00). However, EM-DCR outcomes were comparable to EXT-DCR (RR 1.02, CI 0.98-1.06), whereas EL-DCR had poorer outcomes (RR 0.85, CI 0.79-0.91) when compared separately. The RR for scarring, bleeding and infection with END-DCR versus EXT-DCR was 0.07 (CI 0.02-0.22), 0.72 (CI 0.46-1.13) and 0.24 (CI 0.11- 0.54), respectively. The rates of reported revision surgery were similar. Conclusion: DCR is a procedure with high success rates. Endoscopic procedures differ greatly by technique with EM-DCR offering comparable results to EXT-DCR, without the risk of cosmetically unacceptable scars. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

The study aimed to investigate: (1) which fixation, IMN or plating, was better in the clinical outcomes and in the complications for the treatment of DTF and (2) which modifying variables affected the comparative results between the two modalities. Methods PubMed, EMBASE, OVID, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and specific orthopaedic journals were searched from inception to July 2013, using the search strategy of '('Fracture Fixation, Intramedullary' [MeSH]) AND ('Tibial Fractures' [MeSH]) AND (plate OR plating)'. All prospective and retrospective controlled trials comparing function, pain, bone union and complications between IMN and plating for DTF were identified. Our analysis had no limitation of the language or the publication year. The primary outcome measurements were complication rate, union time, operation time and hospital stays, while the secondary outcome measurements were functional score and pain score. Result Fourteen of 6620 studies with 842 patients were included. IMN was probably preferential to plating for DTF given its higher functional score (p = 0.01), lower risk of infection (p = 0.02) and comparable pain score (p = 0.33), total complication rate (p = 0.53) and time to union (p = 0.86). However, plating had a lower malunion rate than IMN (p < 0.0001). All the results were based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence of moderate quality. Conclusions With a satisfying alignment obtained, IMN may be preferential to plating for fixation of DTF with better function and lower risk of infection. However, IMN showed higher malunion rate for fixation of DTF. With the biases in our meta-analysis, it will ultimately require a rigorous and adequately powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) to prove.

Methods: The electronic databases Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Web of science and the Cochrane Library were used to search for articles from January 1992 to March 2013. The present meta-analysis pooled the effects of outcomes of a total of 1157 patients with 1377 hernias enrolled into 10 randomized controlled trials and 2 comparative studies. The data was analyzed using the statistic software Stata12.0 and IBM SPSS Statistics 19. Results: Significant advantages of totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernioplasty (TEP) compared to the open extraperitoneal approach include a lower incidence of total postoperative complications (Odds Ratio, 0.544; 95% confidence interval, 0.369-0.803), a reduction in urinary problems (0.206[0.064,0.665]), an earlier return to normal activities or work (SMD=-1.798[-3.322,-0.275]), and a shorter length of hospital stay (-1.995 [-2.358,-1.632]). No difference was found in operative time, the incidence of hernia recurrence, chronic pain, intraoperative complications, seromas or hematomas, wound infection and testicular problems between the two techniques. One significant advantage for the open extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair was a lower incidence of peritoneal tears (46.504 [15.399,140.437]). Conclusions: Totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic hernioplasty (TEP) and open extraperitoneal mesh repair are equivalent in most of the analyzed outcomes. TEP is associated with shorter hospital stay, quicker return to normal activities or work, lower incidence of total postoperative complications and urinary problems, while the open extraperitoneal method has less incidence of peritoneal tears. ? 2014 Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scottish charity number SC005317) and Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland."

We systematically reviewed the literature and performed a metaanalysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in HIV-infected individuals using a well validated tool recently developed for use in fMRI, 'GingerALE'. Twenty-one studies (468 HIV +, 270 HIV- controls) were qualitatively reviewed, of which six (105 HIV+, 102 controls) utilized fMRI paradigms engaging the fronto- striatal-parietal network, making a quantitative analysis possible. Our meta-analysis revealed consistent functional differences in the left inferior frontal gyrus and caudate nucleus between infected participants and controls across these studies. This fronto- striatal dysfunction was qualitatively related to cognitive impairment, disease progression and treatment effects.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on brain abscesses published between 1970 and March 2013. Studies were included if they reported at least 10 patients with brain abscesses, included less than 50% extra-axial CNS infections (empyema) without brain abscess, and did not solely report on brain abscesses caused by a single pathogen. Results: We identified 123 studies including 9,699 patients reported between 1935 and 2012. There was a male predominance of 2.4 to 1, and the mean age of patients with brain abscesses was 34 years. The most common causative microorganisms were Streptococcus and Staphylococcus species, comprising 2,000 (34%) and 1,076 (18%) of 5,894 cultured bacteria. Geographical distribution of causative microorganisms over continents was similar and did not substantially change over the past 60 years. Predisposing conditions were present in 8,134 of 9,484 patients (86%) and mostly consisted of contiguous or metastatic foci of infection. The classic triad of fever, headache, and focal neurologic deficits was present in 131 of 668 (20%) of patients. Case fatality rate decreased from 40% to 10% over the past 5 decades, while the rate of patients with full recovery increased from 33% to 70%. Conclusions: The prognosis of patients with brain abscesses has gradually improved over the past 60 years.

This study examines sexual risk behavior among fishermen, primarily in Africa and Asia. A meta-analysis embedded within a systematic review is utilized for this study. This study included 44 peer-reviewed articles and gray literature from 1992 to 2012. The study found that 42% of fishermen engaged in transactional sex, 48% of whom reported not using a condom with FSWs. Ninety percent of the fishermen reported having partners outside of their regular partner, but only 7% reported using a condom with their regular partner. Mobility, peer norms, and alcohol were found to be contextual risks for HIV infection. The findings have important implications for HIV prevention, targeting fishermen, and their sexual networks.

This study aims to determine whether the combined results of the vaccine trials published to date provide evidence of efficacy compared with control (hepatitis A vaccine/placebo). Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and references of identified studies. The bivalent vaccine containing HPV-16 and 18 VLPs from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixenstart, Belgium), the quadrivalent vaccine containing HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs from Merck & Co., Inc., (Whitehouse Station, NJ USA), and the HPV-16 monovalent vaccine from Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, PA USA) were evaluated. Findings: Three RCT reports and two post-trial cohort studies were eligible, comprising data from 13,482 women who were included in the vaccine studies but had evidence of HPV infection at study entry. Data on efficacy was synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel weighted fixed-effect approach, or where there was heterogeneity between studies, the DerSimonian and Laird weighted random-effect approach. The mean odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between Cervarix , Gardasil and HPV-16 monovalent vaccine and HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.44). For the association between Gardasil and HPV-associated vulval/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3, the overall OR and 95% CI was 2.25 (95% CI: 0.78, 6.50). Sample size and follow-up were limited. Conclusions: There was no evidence that HPV vaccines are effective in preventing vaccine-type HPV associated pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior HPV exposure. Small effects of vaccination however cannot be excluded and a longer-term benefit in preventing re-infection remains possible. ? 2014 Miltz et al."

Aim To critically review available data regarding the care of elderly IBD patients. Methods Bibliographic searches (MEDLINE) up to June 2013. Results Approximately 10-15% of cases of IBD are diagnosed in patients aged >60 years, and 10-30% of the IBD population are aged >60 years. In the elderly, IBD is easily confused with other more common diseases, mainly diverticular disease and ischaemic colitis. The clinical features of IBD in older patients are generally similar to those in younger patients. Crohn's disease (CD) in elderly patients is characterised by its predominantly colonic localisation and uncomplicated course. Proctitis and left-sided ulcerative colitis are more common in patients aged >60 years. Infections are associated with age and account for significant mortality in IBD patients. The treatment of IBD in the elderly is generally similar. However, the therapeutic approach in the elderly should be 'start low-go slow'. The benefit of thiopurines in older CD patients remains debatable. Although the indications for anti-tumour necrosis factors in the elderly are generally similar to those for younger patients, lower response and higher adverse events have been reported in the elderly. Surgery in elderly patients does not generally differ. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis can be successful, provided the patient retains good anal sphincter function. Conclusions Management of the older IBD patient differs from that of younger patients; therefore, conventional practice algorithms may have to be modified to account for advanced age. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Body contouring surgery seeks to alleviate some of the discomfort caused by the excessive loose skin following massive weight loss. Higher complication rates are described in this type of surgery when done post-bariatric. The purpose of this article is to compare complication rates of body contouring surgery when performed on patients with weight loss due to bariatric surgery compared to patients who lost weight due to dietary changes and/or exercise. Methods A total of 253 studies were identified by searches in PubMed/Medline databases as well as two hand-search strategies. Three levels of screening resulted in seven studies being considered suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All statistical calculations were performed with Review Manager (RevMan) Version 5.2.3. Results The fixed-effects pooled risk ratio (RR) of developing complications after body contouring surgery when comparing post-bariatric and non-bariatric patients is 1.60 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-1.96; P &lt; 0.00001; I2 = 48%) showing that there is a 60% increase in the risk of developing complications if the patient lost weight due to surgery. A subgroup analysis of studies with patients only having one body contouring procedure shows an 87% higher increase in the risk of developing a complication when being post-bariatric (RR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.46-2.40; P &lt; 0.00001; I2 = 0%). If we exclusively look at the studies with a less uniform patient population that included patients who had one procedure performed as well as patients who had several procedures performed, there seems to be a non-significant 4% lower risk of developing a complication in the case of post-bariatric patients compared to the non-bariatric patients (RR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.65-1.42; P = 0.84; I2 = 0%). Conclusion The analysis shows a 60-87% increased risk of complications in the post-bariatric group compared to the non-bariatric group with statistical significance."

Methods: Information was collected from a literature search using PubMed, Springer, Cochrane Library database and reference lists. The methodological quality of included publications was evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager Version 5.2.5 software. Results: Nine articles were identified for inclusion: four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five prospective observational clinical studies. All the trials were considered to be of fair quality. The results showed that there was a lower incidence of chronic pain (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.79, I2 11%; p &lt; 0.01), and hematoma/seroma (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.87, I2 0%; p &lt; 0.05) in the fibrin glue mesh fixation group.

It has been suggested that HIV-2 infection inhibits the progression of HIV-1 in individuals dually infected by HIV-1 and HIV-2 (HIV-D). We examined whether the mortality rates in dually infected individuals differ from those in persons infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2. DESIGN:: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS:: Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies that reported the number of deaths and person-years of observation (PY) for at least two of the three HIV groups (i.e. HIV-1, HIV-2, and HIV-D). Meta-analyses were then performed with random-effects models, estimating combined mortality rate ratios (MRRs). RESULTS:: Of the 631 identified titles, six articles were included in the meta-analysis of HIV-D-infected individuals versus HIV-mono-infected persons, and seven were included in the analysis of HIV-1-mono-infected versus HIV-2-mono-infected individuals. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-1 was 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.30]. The overall MRR of those infected with HIV-D versus HIV-2 was 1.81 (95% CI 1.43-2.30) and the MRR of those infected with HIV-1 versus HIV-2 was 1.86 (95% CI 1.44-2.39). CONCLUSION:: HIV-2-mono-infected persons have a lower mortality rate than those mono-infected with HIV-1 and those with HIV-D.

However, evidence from studies in children suggests iron may adversely modify the risk of malaria. We reviewed the evidence in pregnancy of the association between malaria and markers of iron status, iron supplementation or parenteral treatment. Methods and Findings: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Global Health Library, and the Malaria in Pregnancy library to identify studies that investigated the association between iron status, iron treatment or supplementation during pregnancy and malaria. Thirty one studies contributed to the analysis; 3 experimental and 28 observational studies. Iron supplementation was not associated with an increased risk of P. falciparum malaria during pregnancy or delivery in Africa (summary Relative Risk = 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.66-1.20, I2 = 78.8%, 5 studies). One study in Asia reported an increased risk of P. vivax within 30 days of iron supplementation (e.g. adjusted Hazard Ratio = 1.75, 95% CI 1.14-2.70 for 1-15 days), but not after 60 days. Iron deficiency (based on ferritin and C-reactive protein) was associated with lower odds for malaria infection (summary Odds Ratio = 0.35, 0.24-0.51, I2 = 59.2%, 5 studies). With the exception of the acute phase protein ferritin, biomarkers of iron deficiency were generally not associated with malaria infection. Conclusions: Iron supplementation was associated with a temporal increase in P vivax, but not with an increased risk of P. falciparum; however, data are insufficient to rule out the potential for an increased risk of P. falciparum. Iron deficiency was associated with a decreased malaria risk in pregnancy only when measured with ferritin. Until there is more evidence, it is prudent to provide iron in combination with malaria prevention during pregnancy. ? 2014 Sangar? et al."

It has been shown that polymorphisms in the MBL2 gene, particularly at codon 54 (variant allele B; wild-type allele designated as A), impact upon host susceptibility to Candida infection. This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the association between MBL2 codon 54 genotype and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) or recurrent VVC (RVVC). Studies were searched in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and ISI Web of Science until April 2013. Five studies including 704 women (386 cases and 318 controls) were part of the meta-analysis, and pooled ORs were calculated using the random effects model. For subjects with RVVC, ORs of AB versus AA and of BB versus AA were 4.84 (95% CI 2.10-11.15; P for heterogeneity =0.013; I2=68.6%) and 12.68 (95% CI 3.74-42.92; P for heterogeneity =0.932, I2=0.0%), respectively. For subjects with VVC, OR of AB versus AA was 2.57 (95% CI 1.29-5.12; P for heterogeneity =0.897; I2=0.0%).

Methods: A comprehensive computerized literature search was carried out in PubMed, EMbase, Ovid, Web of Science, Science Direct, Wan Fang, CNKI and related websites to collect relevant articles (from their establishment date to August 30, 2013). The search terms were ""pre-exposure prophylaxis"", ""high risk population"", ""HIV infection"", ""reduction"", ""relative risk"" and ""efficacy"".

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials to examine the risk of infections in patients treated with hypothermia. DATA SOURCES:: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched for eligible studies up to October 1, 2012. STUDY SELECTION:: We included randomized controlled clinical trials of therapeutic hypothermia induced in adults for any indication, which reported the prevalence of infection in each treatment group. DATA EXTRACTION:: For each study, we collected information about the baseline characteristics of patients, cooling strategy, and infections. DATA SYNTHESIS:: Twenty-three studies were identified, which included 2,820 patients, of whom 1,398 (49.6%) were randomized to hypothermia. Data from another 31 randomized trials, involving 4,004 patients, could not be included because the occurrence of infection was not reported with sufficient detail or not at all. The risk of bias in the included studies was high because information on the method of randomization and definitions of infections lacked in most cases, and assessment of infections was not blinded. In patients treated with hypothermia, the prevalence of all infections was not increased (rate ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 0.95-1.54]), but there was an increased risk of pneumonia and sepsis (risk ratios, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.10-1.90]; 1.80 [95% CI, 1.04-3.10], respectively). CONCLUSION:: The available evidence, subject to its limitations, strongly suggests an association between therapeutic hypothermia and the risk of pneumonia and sepsis, whereas no increase in the overall risk of infection was observed.

Observational studies assessing surgical site infection and anastomotic leakage for alcohol drinkers and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying perioperative alcohol interventions were included. Meta-analyses were performed with random effects models. Methodological quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane methodology. Results: Fifteen observational studies and 2 RCTs were identified. Meta-analyses were performed for alcohol drinkers vs nondrinkers and moderate drinkers (?2 U/day), respectively. No difference between alcohol drinkers and nondrinkers was found. When drinkers and moderate drinkers were compared, a significantly higher incidence of surgical site infection and anastomotic leakage was found in unadjusted studies. In the meta-analysis of studies adjusting for smoking and age, alcohol drinking did not significantly affect surgical site infection and anastomotic leakage. The RCTs did not show any effect of perioperative alcohol abstinence or pharmacological withdrawal treatment on outcome. Conclusions: Alcohol drinking is not an independent risk factor for surgical site infection and anastomotic leakage.

Species in 2 genera, Tenebrio and Tribolium (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) have been used extensively as laboratory intermediate hosts. This review examines experimental studies on ecological aspects of the relationship between H. diminuta and tenebrionid beetles, including the acquisition and establishment of the parasite, host effects on the parasite, and parasite effects on the host. A meta-analysis of infection results from the literature revealed strong relationships across host species and strains between (1) prevalence and intensity of infection, (2) efficiency of cysticercoid production and exposure conditions, and (3) variance in abundance or intensity of infection relative to their respective means. The underlying mechanisms producing these patterns remain elusive. Comparative studies are infrequent, and the use of divergent methodologies hampers comparisons among studies. In spite of these problems, there is much to recommend this as a terrestrial host-parasite model system. It represents those relationships in which mostly minor, but occasionally major, responses to parasitic infection occur, and in which host genetics and environmental conditions can serve as modifying factors. Moreover, this is a tractable experimental system, and is backed by an extensive literature on host biology. ? American Society of Parasitologists 2014."

Objective This meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the comparative effectiveness of systemic antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Methods We searched PubMed and The Cochrane Register of Randomized Controlled Trials up to March 2013 for randomized studies on systemic antifungal prophylaxis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We performed a meta-analysis on the relative effectiveness of systemic antifungal prophylaxis on proven or probable invasive fungal infections using direct and indirect effects. Relative effectiveness was reported as odds ratio (OR) for invasive fungal infections, causative agent, empirical antifungal therapy, and withdrawals due to drug adverse events. Results Twenty evaluable studies provided data on 4823 patients. The risk for invasive fungal infections while on prophylaxis was 5.1% (95% CI, 3.6-6.8%). In patients receiving fluconazole, risks of proven or probable invasive fungal infections (OR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.50; number needed to treat [NNT] = 8), systemic candidiasis (OR = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.05-0.24; NNT = 7), and overall need for empiric antifungal treatment (OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.82; NNT = 8) were reduced compared with patients receiving placebo. Itraconazole was more effective than fluconazole for the prevention of aspergillosis (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.83; NNT = 23) at the expense of more frequent withdrawals (OR = 3.01; 95% CI, 1.77-5.13; number needed to harm = 6). Micafungin was marginally more effective than fluconazole for the prevention of all mold infections (OR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.10-1.18; NNT = 79) and invasive aspergillosis (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-1.11; NNT = 78) and reducing the need for empiric antifungal treatment (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.13-1.21; NNT = 8). There was a relative lack of comparisons between different antifungal prophylactic strategies, including the newer azoles, voriconazole and posaconazole, in this population. Direct effects derived from single studies showed marginally significant effects for voriconazole compared with fluconazole regarding invasive aspergillosis (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.20-1.20; NNT = 35) and the need for empiric treatment (OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.06; NNT = 15). Voriconazole compared with itraconazole (OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88; NNT = 8) and posaconazole compared with amphotericin B (OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-1.24, marginal significance; NNT = 3) were better regarding empirical antifungal treatment. Conclusions Even when on antifungal therapy, invasive fungal infection will develop in 1 of 20 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. There is evidence for the comparable effectiveness of different antifungal drugs used for prophylaxis. Fluconazole is the most widely studied agent, but micafungin might prove to be more effective. There is a relative paucity of studies for the newer azoles, although both voriconazole and posaconazole give proof of their comparative or higher effectiveness to fluconazole in single randomized studies. ? 2014 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc."

Methods: A meta-analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies comparing the index of MTCT among five groups of pregnant women: hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) administration, antiviral treatment, placebo, elective caesarean section, and vaginal delivery. Results: Compared with the control group, the incidence of HBV intrauterine infection (RR = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.27-0.64, P < 0.0001) and the number of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infants (RR = 0.44, 95 % CI 0.32-0.61, P < 0.00001) were lower in the HBIG administration group. In the antiviral treatment group, serum HBV DNA levels were lower (MD = -4.01, 95 % CI -5.07 to -2.94, P < 0.00001) at the time of delivery, and normalization of ALT levels was better (RR = 1.11, 95 % CI 1.06-1.17, P < 0.0001). Infant serum HBsAg positivity (RR = 0.45, 95 % CI 0.22-0.91, P = 0.03) and incidence of infant HBV transmission RR = 0.06, 95 % CI 0.01-0.24, P < 0.0001) were reduced in antiviral the treatment group. Infant serum anti-HBs positivity at birth (RR = 1.24, 95 % CI 0.89-1.74, P = 0.2) or at 6-7 months (RR = 0.98, 95 % CI 0.86-1.11, P = 0.73) was not significantly different between the caesarean section and vaginal delivery groups. The incidence of infant CHB infection may have been higher in the vaginal delivery group (RR = 2.20, 95 % CI 1.02-4.74, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Administration of HBIG or antiviral therapy to HBV carrier mothers during pregnancy is effective in reducing MTCT. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Nevertheless, the use of antioxidant therapy remains controversial. We tried to demonstrate that intravenous selenium supplementation could promote antioxidant status and help protect against infection and organ failure, improving outcome in critically ill patients. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the exogenous supplementation of selenium versus standard therapy without any adjuvant in critically ill adults. Results: Nine RCTs met inclusion criteria. Selenium supplementation was associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality of borderline statistical significance (risk ratio = 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.71-0.99, P = .04). The analysis of pre-defined subgroups detected no significant effects regarding the supplementation with doses of selenium ?. 500 £gg/d, administration of a load dose with a bolus and duration of treatment. Only 2 studies analyzed 6-month mortality and could not show a difference. No effects could be demonstrated on hospital length of stay, pulmonary infections, or renal failure. Conclusions: The use of high-dose selenium might be associated with a beneficial effect on 28-day mortality in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the use of selenium as adjuvant therapy needs further evaluations. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc."

The authors compared the safety of tissue expander/implant reconstruction with that of autologous abdominal tissue reconstruction. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified peer-reviewed studies published from January of 2000 to October of 2012 that compared tissue expander/implant against autologous abdominal tissue reconstruction in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases. Two reviewers independently screened all reports and selected the relevant articles using specific inclusion criteria. Data were extracted from the relevant articles using a standardized abstraction form. RESULTS: Fourteen observational studies were identified that included more than 3000 reconstructed breasts. Significant differences were found between these two approaches. The relative risk associated with reconstructive failure favored autologous abdominal tissue (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent CI, 0.06 to 0.32; I2 = 0 percent). Surgical-site infection was significantly lower in autologous abdominal tissue reconstruction compared with tissue expander/implant (relative risk, 0.37; 95 percent CI, 0.25 to 0.55; I2 = 0 percent), although skin or flap necrosis was higher in autologous abdominal tissue reconstruction compared with tissue expander/implant (relative risk, 2.79; 95 percent CI, 1.87 to 4.17). Studies were of low to moderate quality according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that tissue expander/implant reconstruction has a higher risk of reconstructive failure and surgical-site infection compared with autologous abdominal tissue reconstruction. With the lack of long-term safety studies on different approaches to breast reconstruction, additional long-term comparative studies are needed to support evidence-based decision-making.

We attempted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of those two agents. Studies comparing daptomycin to linezolid treatment for VRE bacteremia, published until August 2012, were identified from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. All comparative studies on patients older than 18 years of age that provided mortality data were considered eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. he primary outcome of the meta-analysis was 30-day all-cause mortality. Ten retrospective studies including 967 patients were identified. Patients treated with daptomycin had significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 2.40) and infection-related mortality (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.42 to 9.20) rates than patients treated with linezolid. When data from all 10 studies were combined, overall mortality was also significantly increased among patients treated with daptomycin (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.89). These findings were confirmed when odds ratios adjusted for potential confounders were pooled. Relapse rates among patients treated with daptomycin were also higher (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 0.94 to 6.72), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Adverse event rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Notwithstanding the absence of randomized prospective data, available evidence suggests that mortality rates may be higher with daptomycin than with linezolid among patients treated for VRE bacteremia.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2014,Colorectal Disease,10.1111/codi.12491,24245821,"Aim: Anastomotic leakage is the one of the most serious complications in rectal cancer surgery and is associated with high mortality, morbidity and an increased incidence of local recurrence. Although many studies have compared drained and undrained colorectal anastomoses, to date the role of pelvic drainage in extraperitoneal colorectal anastomosis remains undefined. Method: We carried out a systematic review of the literature, performing an unrestricted search in MEDLINE and Embase up to 30 October 2012. Reference lists of retrieved articles and review articles were manually searched for other relevant studies. We performed a meta-analysis of the data currently available on the incidence of extraperitoneal anastomotic leakage, according to the presence or absence of pelvic drainage. Results: Overall, eight studies - three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and five non-RCTs, comprising a total of 2277 patients - were included in the meta-analysis. Pelvic drainage was demonstrated to reduce both the leak rate and the rate of reintervention in patients who underwent anterior rectal resection with extraperitoneal colorectal anastomosis (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73; and OR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.18-0.46, respectively) compared with patients without drainage. Overall mortality and infection rates were also evaluated, but a nonsignificant correlation was found with the presence of drainage. Conclusion: The meta-analysis shows that the presence of a pelvic drain reduces the incidence of extraperitoneal colorectal anastomotic leakage and the rate of reintervention after anterior rectal resection. ? 2013 The Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland."

The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the current evidence regarding the use of hysteroscopy for treatment of RPOC. Study design A literature search was conducted in December 2012 using MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials. The study selection criteria were use of the standard hysteroscopic technique for removal of RPOC in 5 or more cases, in any study design. We reviewed 11 studies, of which 5 retrospective studies met the selection criteria (comprising 326 cases). The rates of incomplete RPOC removal, surgical complications, post-operative IUA and subsequent pregnancies were abstracted and weighted events rates using a fixed meta-analysis model were calculated. Results Only one study compared the rates of IUA following hysteroscopy and curettage, precluding a meta-analysis comparison of the two techniques. There were no cases of incomplete RPOC removal. Three perioperative complications occurred (uterine perforation, infection, and vaginal bleeding). IUA on follow-up hysteroscopy were found in 4/96 women (weighted rate of 5.7%, 95% CI 2.4%, 13.0%). Of the 120 women desiring a subsequent pregnancy 91 conceived (weighted rate of 75.3%, 95% CI 66.7%, 82.3%). Conclusions The lack of traditional curettage comparison groups in most studies precludes the conclusion that hysteroscopy is superior to traditional curettage, but this procedure does appear to have low complication rates, low rates of IUA, and high rates of subsequent pregnancies. ? 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

Study Selection: Studies were selected that reported the number of E. coli O157 cases that developed reactive arthritis (ReA), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, or Guillain Barr? syndrome. Methods: Three levels of screening and data extraction of articles were conducted using predefined data fields. Meta-analysis was performed on unique outcome measures using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 value. Meta-regression was used to explore the influence of nine study-level variables on heterogeneity. Results: A total of 82 studies were identified reporting 141 different outcome measures; 81 reported on HUS and one reported on ReA. Depending on the number of cases of E. coli O157, the estimate for the proportion of E. coli O157 cases that develop HUS ranged from 17.2% in extra-small studies (&lt;50 cases) to 4.2% in extra-large studies (&gt;1000 cases).

This systematic review evaluated current evidence regarding the effectiveness of this checklist in reducing postoperative complications. Methods: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL were searched using predefined inclusion criteria. The systematic review included all original articles reporting a quantitative measure of the effect of the WHO SSC on postoperative complications. Data were extracted for postoperative complications reported in at least two studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of the WHO SSC on any complication, surgical-site infection (SSI) and mortality. Yule's Q contingency coefficient was used as a measure of the association between effectiveness and adherence with the checklist. Results: Seven of 723 studies identified met the inclusion criteria. There was marked methodological heterogeneity among studies. The impact on six clinical outcomes was reported in at least two studies. A meta-analysis was performed for three main outcomes (any complication, mortality and SSI). Risk ratios for any complication, mortality and SSI were 0¡P59 (95 per cent confidence interval 0¡P47 to 0¡P74), 0¡P77 (0¡P60 to 0¡P98) and 0¡P57 (0¡P41 to 0¡P79) respectively. There was a strong correlation between a significant decrease in postoperative complications and adherence to aspects of care embedded in the checklist (Q = 0¡P82; P = 0¡P042).

During the last years, it has become an emerging problem in North America and Europe due to increasing international migration. Here we describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Brazil through a systematic review. We searched national and international electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Brazil, performed from 1980 until September 2012. Forty-two articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 4985 references. Prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.1%. Most surveys were performed in the Northeast region, especially in the state of Piau?. We observed a high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates (I2&gt;75%; p&lt;0.001). The pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.2% (95% CI: 3.1-5.7), ranging from 4.4% (95% CI: 2.3-8.3) in the 1980s to 2.4% (95% CI: 1.5-3.8) after 2000.

The 2005 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines introduced a concept of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to define patients at higher risk of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, thus requiring broad spectrum therapy. There has been no systematic evaluation of the ability of this definition to identify antibiotic-resistant pathogens.Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing the frequency of resistant pathogens (defined as methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in populations with HCAP compared with populations with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The frequencies of pathogens in each group were pooled using a random effects model.Results. Twenty-four studies were included (n = 22 456). Overall study quality was poor. HCAP was associated with an increased risk of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (odds ratio [OR], 4.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.69-6.04) enterobactericeae (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.69-2.63), and P. aeruginosa (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 2.04-3.72; all P <. 0001), but these analyses were confounded by publication bias. The discriminatory ability of HCAP for resistant pathogens was low (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.69-0.71) and was lower in high-quality (AUC, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.62-0.70) and prospective studies (AUC, 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). After adjustment for age and comorbidities, mortality was not increased in HCAP (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.85-1.70; P =. 30).Conclusions. The HCAP concept is based on predominantly low-quality evidence and does not accurately identify resistant pathogens. Mortality in HCAP does not appear to be due to a higher frequency of resistant pathogens. ? 2013 The Author 2013.

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised, controlled trials comparing intraoperative, mid-term and late complications of these two techniques. Methods: Pertinent studies were searched in BioMedCentral, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of clinical trials. We selected all randomised studies comparing SDT and GWDF techniques in adult critically ill patients published in a peer-reviewed journal. Results: Among 1040 retrieved studies, five eligible studies randomising 363 patients (181 to GWDF, 182 to SDT) were identified. The incidence of the composite outcome difficult cannula insertion/difficult dilation or failure was higher with the GWDF technique (15.5% vs. 4.9 %, P = 0.02). Moreover, intraprocedural bleeding was more common in the GWDF group (19.3% vs. 7.6% in SDT group, P = 0.018). A trend towards an increased incidence of fracture of tracheal rings was noted in the SDT group (6.5% vs. 0.5% in the GWDF group, P = 0.13). No difference in mid-term or long-term complications was observed. Conclusion: GWDF technique is associated with a higher incidence of intraprocedural bleeding and of technical difficulties in completing the procedure (difficult cannula insertions/difficult dilations or failures) compared with the SDT technique. No differences were identified in mid-term and long-term complications.

Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and men who have sex with men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U.S.-based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men and women.

To drive a more precise estimate of this postulated relationship, a meta-analysis was performed based on existing relevant studies. Methods: We combined individual patient data from 12 studies which involved 1000 patients with gastric cancer, which met the criteria. We tabulated and analyzed parameters from each study, including H. pylori, EBV, MSI, and clinical information of patients. Results: The overall OR for H. pylori infection in CIMP positive group vs. negative group revealed that significantly elevated risks of positive H. pylori infection in the former were achieved (OR 2.23 95% CI, 1.25-4.00; P = 0.007, Pheterogeneity = 0.05).

However, there did not appear to be any correlations with clinical parameters such as tumor site, pathological type, cell differentiation, TNM stage, distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and 5-year survival. Conclusions: The meta-analysis highlights the strong relation of CIMP with H. pylori, EBV, and MSI, but CIMP can not be used as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer. ? 2014 Zong, Seto."

This meta-analysis sought to assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis and to determine appropriate duration of prophylaxis. METHODS: An English language literature search was conducted using PubMed and the Cochrane Collaboration for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in patients undergoing clean and clean-contaminated plastic and reconstructive surgery. Data from intention-to-treat analyses were used where available. For the dichotomous data, results for each study were odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method or the DerSimonian and Laird method. Study quality was critically appraised by 2 reviewers using established criteria. STATA version 12 was used for meta-analyses. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs involving 2395 patients were included, of which 8 trials were considered to be of high methodological quality. Effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in plastic and reconstructive surgery was found favorable over placebo in SSI prevention (13 studies; 2449 participants; OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7; P < 0.01) and the other wound complication (OWC) prevention (9 studies; 1843 participants; OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.84; P < 0.02). Subgroup analysis performed according to surgical wound type or the duration of prophylaxis did not modify the results except for the OWC with short-term antibiotic treatment. Compared with short-term antibiotic prophylaxis, long-term administration showed no evidence of a difference in risk of SSI (7 studies; 1012 participants; OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.63-1.55; P < 0.95), OWC (5 studies; 824 participants; OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.46-1.86; P < 0.82), and adverse event relative to antibiotic administration (3 studies; 653 participants; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.01-4.92; P < 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of RCTs provides evidence supporting that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced postoperative SSI in clean plastic surgeries with high-risk factors and clean-contaminated plastic surgeries.

Arterial catheters are commonly used in the critical care setting and are among the most heavily manipulated vascular access devices. We sought to evaluate the prevalence of arterial catheter-related bloodstream infection. DATA SOURCES:: PubMed, CinAHL, EMBASE, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION:: Included studies reported prevalence rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection for arterial catheters used for critical illness or postoperative monitoring. For the purposes of this study, catheter-related bloodstream infection was defined as positive blood culture collected from an arterial catheter and from the periphery with the same organism in a patient demonstrating systemic signs of sepsis. DATA EXTRACTION:: The study population, site of insertion, antiseptic preparation, catheter days, and prevalence of catheter-related bloodstream infection were abstracted. When data were not available, authors were contacted for further information. DATA SYNTHESIS:: Forty-nine studies met criteria including 222 cases of arterial catheter-related bloodstream infection in 30,841 catheters. Pooled incidence was 3.40/1,000 catheters or 0.96/1,000 catheter days. Prevalence was considerably higher in the subgroup of studies that cultured all catheters (1.26/1,000 catheter days) compared with those studies that cultured only when the arterial catheter was suspected as the source for the catheter-related bloodstream infection (0.70/1,000 catheter days). Pooled data also found a significantly increased risk of infection for femoral site of insertion compared with radial artery for arterial catheter placement (relative risk, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.32-2.84; p = 0.001) CONCLUSIONS:: Arterial catheters are an underrecognized cause of catheter-related bloodstream infection. Pooled incidence when catheters were systematically cultured and correlated to blood culture results indicated a substantial burden of arterial catheter-related bloodstream infection. Selection of a radial site over a femoral site will help reduce the risk of arterial catheter-related bloodstream infection. Future studies should evaluate technologies applied to preventing central venous catheter-related bloodstream infection to arterial catheters as well. ? 2014 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

DATA SOURCES:: Multiple computerized database searches supplemented by manual searches including relevant conference proceedings. STUDY SELECTION:: Randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing compared with conventional dressings for prevention of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection. DATA EXTRACTION:: Data were extracted on patient and catheter characteristics and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS:: Nine randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Use of a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing resulted in a reduced prevalence of catheter-related bloodstream infection (random effects relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.88, p = 0.009). The prevalence of catheter colonization was also markedly reduced in the chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing group (random effects relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64; p < 0.001). There was significant benefit for prevention of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection, including arterial catheters used for hemodynamic monitoring. Other than in low birth weight infants, adverse effects were rare and minor. CONCLUSIONS:: Our analysis shows that a chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing is beneficial in preventing catheter colonization and, more importantly, catheter-related bloodstream infection and warrants routine use in patients at high risk of catheter-related bloodstream infection and central venous catheter or arterial catheter colonization. ? 2014 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine."

This meta-analysis was performed to validate the association between RAS and H. pylori infection. Materials and methods: The PubMed database was searched up to January 25, 2013 to select studies on the prevalence of H. pylori infection between RAS patients and control subjects. Studies were included if they evaluated and clearly defined exposure to RAS, reported the incidence of H. pylori infection, or provided data for their estimation. For subgroup analyses, studies were separated by region, publication year, and source of controls to screen the potential factors against the results. Before meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Summary odds ratio (OR) estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the fixed-effects model. Results: Seven case-control studies containing 339 cases and 271 controls were eventually selected for analysis. A total of 100 (29.50 %) RAS patients had H. pylori infection, which was significantly greater than the 54 (19.93 %) non-RAS controls with H. pylori infection (OR = 1.85, 95 % CI: 1.24-2.74, P = 0.002). This result persisted in a hospital-based control subgroup (OR = 2.72, 95 % CI: 1.57-4.72). Conclusions: Based on our meta-analysis, H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of RAS. Clinical relevance: The eradication of H. pylori in the stomach may promote relief of RAS symptoms and healing of oral ulcers, and even prevent the occurrence of RAS. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Methods: Two systematic literature searches identified studies reporting infection rates in patients treated with intramedullary nails for tibia fractures receiving systemic antibiotics only (search one) and in patients receiving adjunctive locally-administered antibiotics peri-operatively at the tissue-implant interface (search two). After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 and seven papers from searches one and two, respectively, were included in meta-analyses. Results: The absolute rate of infection was lower for all Gustilo-Anderson grades of tibia fractures when local antibiotics were administered as adjunctive prophylactic therapy. For severe fractures, classified as GAIII fractures, patients receiving systemic antibiotics only had an infection rate of 14.4 % [95 % CI: 10.5 %, 18.5 %]; adding local antibiotics reduced the rate to 2.4 % [0.0 %, 9.4 %], with an odds ratio of 0.17. Risk of deep wound infections increased with severity of fracture, rising to over 31 % in GIIIB&C fractures for patients receiving systematic antibiotics only, but to below 9 % with additional local antibiotics. Conclusion: The findings support consideration of augmenting the antibiotic prophylaxis regimen to include locally-delivered antibiotics. Patients with severe fractures will obtain greatest benefit from infections avoided. No trial directly compared the two treatments for open tibia fractures, limiting the ability to attribute the differences in observed infection rates directly to the treatments themselves. A large comparative study to improve the evidence on relative effect size is merited. Level of evidence: Level III. ? 2014 The Author(s)."

Some studies have suggested that cirrhosis is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, but the results remain controversial. This meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the association between cirrhosis and H. Pylori infection. Published articles on H. Pylori prevalence in patients with cirrhosis were collected to assess the potential associations between H. Pylori infection and cirrhosis risk. Twenty-one eligible studies were included for the analysis. Data on publication year, geographic region, and etiology were summarized. Metaregression models and subgroup analyses were established to screen the factors for heterogeneity. Of the 322 articles retrieved, 21 met the inclusion criteria. These studies involved 6135 cases, with a total H. Pylori infection rate of 52.26%. This meta-analysis showed significant difference in H. Pylori infection between patients with cirrhosis and controls [odd ratio (OR)=2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-3.18, P<0.0001].

Recent studies suggest that pre-biopsy screening for fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQ-R) pathogens may be useful in reducing post-biopsy infections. We sought to determine the baseline prevalence of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance in rectal flora and to investigate the relationship between pre-biopsy carriage of FQ-R pathogens and the risk of post-TRUSPB infection. Electronic databases were searched for related literature. Studies were assessed for methodological quality and comparable outcomes prior to meta-analysis (using quality- and random-effects models). Nine studies, representing 2541 patients, were included. The prevalence of FQ resistance was higher (20.4%, 95% CI 18.2-22.6%) in rectal cultures obtained following FQ-based prophylaxis compared with those obtained before (12.8%, 95% CI 10.7-15.0%). Overall infection rates in patients using empirical prophylaxis were higher (3.3%, 95% CI 2.6-4.2%) than in those using altered (targeted/protocol) regimens (0.3%, 95% CI 0-0.9%). Higher infection rates were seen in men with FQ-R rectal cultures (7.1%, 95% CI 4.0-10.5%) than in those with FQ-sensitive (FQ-S) rectal cultures (1.1%, 95% CI 0.5-1.8%). For every 14 men with FQ-R rectal cultures, one additional infection was observed compared with men with FQ-S rectal cultures. Prior FQ use and prior genitourinary infection were significant risk factors for FQ-R colonisation. FQ resistance in rectal flora is a significant predictor of post-TRUSPB infection and may require re-assessment of empirical antimicrobial prophylaxis methods. Altered prophylaxis based on rectal culturing prior to TRUSPB may reduce morbidity and potentially provide economic benefits to health services. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether RBC transfusion thresholds are associated with the risk of infection and whether risk is independent of leukocyte reduction. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Sytematic Reviews, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number register were searched through January 22, 2014. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials with restrictive vs liberal RBC transfusion strategies. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one randomized trials with 8735 patients met eligibility criteria, of which 18 trials (n = 7593 patients) contained sufficient information for meta-analyses. DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were used to report pooled risk ratios. Absolute risks of infection were calculated using the profile likelihood random-effects method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of health care-associated infection such as pneumonia, mediastinitis, wound infection, and sepsis. RESULTS: The pooled risk of all serious infections was 11.8% (95% CI, 7.0%-16.7%) in the restrictive group and 16.9% (95% CI, 8.9%-25.4%) in the liberal group. The risk ratio (RR) for the association between transfusion strategies and serious infection was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.95) with little heterogeneity (I2 = 0%; £n2 &lt;.0001). The number needed to treat (NNT) with restrictive strategies to prevent serious infection was 38 (95% CI, 24-122). The risk of infection remained reduced with a restrictive strategy, even with leukocyte reduction (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67-0.95]). For trials with a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of &lt;7.0 g/dL, the RR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.97) with NNT of 20 (95% CI, 12-133). With stratification by patient type, the RR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54-0.91) in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.28-0.95) in patients presenting with sepsis. There were no significant differences in the incidence of infection by RBC threshold for patients with cardiac disease, the critically ill, those with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, or for infants with low birth weight. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among hospitalized patients, a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy was associated with a reduced risk of health care-associated infection compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. Implementing restrictive strategies may have the potential to lower the incidence of health care-associated infection. Copyright 2014 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

However, estimation of clinical and public health impacts of HIV/HBV co-infection requires a robust and reliable epidemiological data for an appropriate estimation of the logistical, economic, and humanitarian impact of the two viruses in Nigeria. Objective: The aim of this review was to estimate the prevalence and burden of HBV infections in HIV-infected patients in Nigeria. Methods: Estimates were derived from a random effects meta-analysis of observational studies reporting the prevalence of HBV/HIV in Nigeria. The derived estimate for the prevalence of HBV/HIV co-infection was applied to the total HIV-infected populations in Nigeria to give an estimated burden of HBV/HIV co-infection in Nigeria. Result: Thirty three studies with quality data from seventeen states in Nigeria, up to December 16, 2013, were included. I-squared heterogeneity was 98%. Random effect model (REM) estimate of prevalence among HIV-infected patients from the 33 studies was 15% (95% CI 13-17).

Our objective was to assess the burden of MRSA colonization on admission, study the time trends, and examine the significance of MRSA colonization in this population. METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were consulted. Studies that reported prevalence of MRSA colonization on ICU admission were selected. Two authors independently extracted data on MRSA colonization and infection. RESULTS: We identified 18 suitable articles and found an overall prevalence of MRSA colonization of 1.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3%- 2.6%) on admission to the NICU or PICU, with a stable trend over the past 12 years. Interestingly, 5.8% (95% CI 1.9%-11.4%) of outborn neonates were colonized with MRSA on admission to NICU, compared with just 0.2% (95% CI 0.0%-0.9%) of inborn neonates (P = .01). The pooled acquisition rate of MRSA colonization was 4.1% (95% CI 1.2%- 8.6%) during the NICU and PICU stay and was as high as 6.1% (95% CI 2.8%-10.6%) when the NICU population was studied alone. There was a relative risk of 24.2 (95% CI 8.9-66.0) for colonized patients to develop a MRSA infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: In the NICU and PICU, there are carriers of MRSA on admission, and MRSA colonization in the NICU is almost exclusively associated with outborn neonates. Importantly, despite infection control measures, the acquisition rate is high, and patients colonized with MRSA on admission are more likely to suffer a MRSA infection during hospitalization.? 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

The probability of S. aureus infection at the catheter site for hemodialysis was 87% lower in the mupirocin group than in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.05-0.34; p < 0.001). The risk of bacteremia was 82% lower in the mupirocin group than in the control group (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.08-0.42; p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference in bacteremia was observed between the various treatments group (excluding mupirocin) and the control group (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.51-1.15; p = 0.20). Conclusions: Twenty-six percent of patients undergoing hemodialysis were nasal carriers of S. aureus. Of all treatments evaluated, topical mupirocin was the most effective therapy for the reduction of S. aureus catheter site infection and bacteremia in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. ? 2014 Grothe et al."

This meta-analysis assessed whether C.pneumoniae infection was associated with risk of cerebral infarction. Methods: Systematic computerized searches of the PubMed and Web of Knowledge were performed. Adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval from original studies were extracted for combined meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-three studies with 2924 cerebral infarction patients and 4692 control patients were included in the meta-analysis. When the positive C.pneumoniae infection was defined by microimmunofluorescence-detected immunoglobulin A, the pooled odds ratio between two groups was 2¡P04 (95% confidence interval 1¡P42-2¡P9). In the most frequently used immunoglobulin A ?1:16 sub-group, the pooled odds ratio was 2¡P07 (95% confidence interval 1¡P31-3¡P26). When the infection was defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-detected immunoglobulin A, the pooled odds ratio was 2¡P89 (95% confidence interval 1¡P23-6¡P81). When the infection was defined by microimmunofluorescence-detected immunoglobulin G, the pooled odds ratio was 1¡P46 (95% confidence interval 1¡P18-1¡P81). In the most frequently used immunoglobulin G ?1:32 sub-group, the pooled odds ratio was 1¡P43 (95% confidence interval 1¡P06-1¡P92).

No previous study has sought to summarize existing evidence on the use of taurolidine-citrate locks. A systematic review and meta-analysis were undertaken to determine whether taurolidine-citrate was more effective than heparin in the prevention of CRB. Methods: The major English (PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science and OVID) and Chinese (CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang Data) healthcare databases were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of taurolidine-citrate lock solution (TCLS) and heparin lock solution in the prevention of CRB. Results: Three studies involving 236 patients with a total of 34,984 catheter days were included. The use of TCLS significantly decreased the risk of CRB (relative risk = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.25-0.89) and Gram-negative bacterial infection. There was no significant difference in Gram-positive infections and exit-site infections. Conclusions: Catheter locking with TCLS reduced the risk of CRB and Gram-negative bacterial infection.

Antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-£\) agents are widely used for treatment of rheumatic and dermatological diseases. We conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of HBV reactivation among patients treated with anti-TNF-£\. Methods and Findings. A comprehensive literature search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases was conducted. From 21 studies included in the systematic review, 9 included patients with occult chronic HBV infection and 6 included patients with overt infection while 6 addressed both groups. Based on 10 studies eligible for meta-analysis we report pooled estimate of HBV reactivation of 4.2% (95% CI: 1.4-8.2%, I 2: 74.7%). The pooled prevalence of reactivation was 3.0% (95% CI: 0.6-7.2, I 2: 77.1%) for patients with occult infection, and 15.4% (95% CI: 1.2-41.2%, I 2: 79.9%) for overt infection. The prevalence of reactivation was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.1-8.4%, I 2: 51.1%) for treatment with etanercept and 4.6% (95% CI: 0.5-12.5%, I 2: 28.7%) for adalimumab. For subgroup of patients without any antiviral prophylaxis the pooled reactivation was 4.0% (95% CI: 1.2-8.3%, I 2: 75.6%). Conclusion. Although HBV reactivation rate is relatively low in patients treated with anti-TNF-£\ for rheumatic and dermatological conditions, the antiviral prophylaxis would be recommended in patients with overt chronic HBV infection. ? 2014 Fabrizio Cantini et al."

Antibiotic stewardship programmes (ASPs) may prevent C. difficile infections by limiting exposure to certain antibiotics. Our objective was to perform a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the effect of ASPs on the risk of C. difficile infection in hospitalized adult patients. Methods: Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and two Cochrane databases were conducted to find all published studies on interventions related to antibiotic stewardship and C. difficile. Two investigators independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black tool. Risk ratios were pooled using random effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 statistic. Results: The final search yielded 891 articles; 78 full articles were reviewed and 16 articles were identified for inclusion. Included articles used quasi-experimental (interrupted time series or before-after) or observational (case-control) study designs. When the results of all studies were pooled in a random effects model, a significant protective effect (pooled risk ratio 0.48; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.62) was observed between ASPs and C. difficile incidence. When stratified by intervention type, a significant effect was found for restrictive ASPs (complete removal of drug or prior approval requirement). Furthermore, ASPs were particularly effective in geriatric settings. Conclusions: Restrictive ASPs can be used to reduce the risk of C. difficile infection.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the infection risk in cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs. Patients and methods: We searched PubMed and the ASCO online database of meeting abstracts up to January 2014 for relevant clinical trials. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of cetuximab and panitumumab that reported adequate safety data for grade 3-4 infection or febrile neutropenia (FN). The summary incidence, relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 14,957 patients from 28 trials were included. Treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs was associated with an increased risk of high-grade infection (RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.33-1.66; P<. 0.001) and FN (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09-1.48; P= 0.002).

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to answer the following question: Are antibiotic-impregnated shunts (AISs) superior to standard shunts (SSs) at reducing the risk of shunt infection in pediatric patients with hydrocephalus? Methods. Both the US National Library of Medicine PubMed/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were queried using MeSH headings and key words relevant to AIS use in children. Abstracts were reviewed, after which studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. An evidentiary table was assembled summarizing the studies and the quality of their evidence (Classes I-III). A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to calculate a cumulative estimate of treatment effect using risk ratio (RR). Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square and I2 statistics. Based on the quality of the literature and the result of the meta-analysis, a recommendation was rendered (Level I, II, or III). Results. Six studies, all Class III, met our inclusion criteria. All but one study focused on a retrospective cohort and all but one were conducted at a single institution. Four of the studies failed to demonstrate a lowered infection rate with the use of an AIS. However, when the data from individual studies were pooled together, the infection rate in the AIS group was 5.5% compared with 8.6% in the SS group. Using a random-effects model, the cumulative RR was 0.51 (95% CI 0.29-0.89, p < 0.001), indicating that a shunt infection was 1.96 times more likely in patients who received an SS. Conclusions. We recommend AIS tubing because of the associated lower risk of shunt infection compared to the use of conventional silicone hardware (quality of evidence: Class III; strength of recommendation: Level III). RECOMMENDATION: Antibiotic-impregnated shunt (AIS) tubing may be associated with a lower risk of shunt infection compared with conventional silicone hardware and thus is an option for children who require placement of a shunt. STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION: Level III, unclear degree of clinical certainty. ?AANS, 2014."

The aim of this review is to estimate the number of Rotavirus infection among Iranian children by performing a systematic review and estimating a pooled data.Methods: We performed a systematic literature review in relevant databases including PUBMED, MEDLINE, OVID, SID, MAGIRAN, and IRANMEDEX. Search in databases was done in October 10, 2013. Meta-analysis was performed using the STATA statistical package version 11. We assessed heterogeneity by Q-test and used random model for pooling measures of proportion of Rotavirus infection among Iranian children with diarrhea (and 95% confidence intervals [CI]). Sub group analysis between in-patient and outpatient group were done and publication bias was assessed by Egger and Begg tests.Results: A total of 154 records were identified in our searching. There were 36 studies including a total of 15,368 children with diarrhea. Out of 15,368 children, 6,338 were positive for Rotavirus gastroenteritis. Overall pooled estimate of infection with Rotavirus among cases of gastroenteritis was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.28-0.41). Pooled estimates for hospitalized children and outpatient subgroups were 0.39 (95% CI, 0.30-0.48), and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.23-0.38), respectively.Conclusions: This study supports the importance of Rotavirus in the Iranian population such as common cause of diarrhea among children.

Methods: We collected reports from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science, along with references cited therein. We included prospective, randomized studies on systemic antibiotic prophylaxis in HSCT recipients. Results: Seventeen trials with 1453 autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients were included. Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with placebo or no prophylaxis in 10 trials and with non-absorbable antibiotics in two trials. Systemic antibiotics other than fluoroquinolones were evaluated in five of these 12 trials. Four trials evaluated the effect of the addition of antibiotics for gram-positive bacteria to fluoroquinolones. One trial compared two different systemic antibiotic regimens: fluoroquinolones versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. As a result, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of febrile episodes (OR 0.16; 95%CI 0.09-0.30), clinically or microbiologically documented infection (OR 0.38; 95%CI 0.22-0.63) and bacteremia (OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.16-0.59) without significantly affecting all-cause mortality or infection-related mortality. Conclusions: Systemic antibiotic prophylaxis successfully reduced the incidence of infection. However, there was no significant impact on mortality.

Objective To assess the frequency of congenital transmission of T. cruzi. Search strategy PubMed, Journals@Ovid Full Text, EMBASE, CINAHL, Fuente Academica and BIREME databases were searched using seven search terms related to Chagas disease or T. cruzi and congenital transmission. Selection criteria The inclusion criteria were the following: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese or Spanish language; case report, case series or observational study; original data on congenital T. cruzi infection in humans; congenital infection rate reported or it could be derived. This systematic review included 13 case reports/series and 51 observational studies. Data collection and analysis Two investigators independently collected data on study characteristics, diagnosis and congenital infection rate. The principal summary measure - the congenital transmission rate - is defined as the number of congenitally infected infants divided by the number of infants born to infected mothers. A random effects model was used. Main results The pooled congenital transmission rate was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-5.6%). Countries where T. cruzi is endemic had a higher rate of congenital transmission compared with countries where it is not endemic (5.0% versus 2.7%).

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to analyze data on ETV and ETV/CPC (choroid plexus cauterization) outcomes in hopes of providing a clear understanding of their limitations in patients with hydrocephalus due to hemorrhage, infection, Dandy-Walker malformation, or neural tube disorders. Methods: An extensive PubMed search dating back 11 years was performed on primary ETV or ETV/CPC procedures for hydrocephalus due to infection, hemorrhage, neural tube defects, and Dandy-Walker malformation. ETV success was defined as no intraoperative or post-operative complications and no need for revision surgery at follow-up. Results: Ten studies were identified for analysis. The data represent 534 patients undergoing primary ETV and 167 patients undergoing primary ETV/CPC. The ETV group reached a 55 % success rate, while the ETV/CPC group reached a 67 % success rate. Success rates of ETV alone for hydrocephalus due to infection, neural tube defects, and intraventricular hemorrhage reached 54, 55, and 57 %, respectively. 84 % success was found in patients older than 2 years of age and 52 % success in patients less than 2 years of age. Conclusions: ETV is a valid treatment for hydrocephalus of any etiology.

We identified 979 articles in the initial search and 10 randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. The combination of hand hygiene with facemasks was found to have statistically significant efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza while hand hygiene alone did not. Our meta-regression model did not identify statistically significant effects of latitude, temperature or humidity on the efficacy of hand hygiene. Our findings highlight the potential importance of interventions that protect against multiple modes of influenza transmission, and the modest efficacy of hand hygiene suggests that additional measures besides hand hygiene may also be important to control influenza.

Two reviewers independently screened the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the quality using NOS, and then Meta analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.2 software. Results A total of 11 cohort studies involving 6 274 patients were included. According to the different follow-up times for subgroup analysis, the results of meta-analysis showed that, compared with the healthy volunteers who did not expose the acute gastrointestinal infection, the patients with acute gastroenteritis had a increase risk of irritable bowel syndrome within 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 2-3 years (3 months: RR=6.46, 95%CI 1.85 to 22.58, P=0.003; 6 months: RR=4.68, 95%CI 2.07 to 10.60, P=0.000 2; 12 months: RR=4.95, 95%CI 2.90 to 8.45, P<0.000 01; 2-3 years: RR=3.11, 95%CI 2.72 to 3.56, P<0.000 01). However, after the fifth year of acute gastroenteritis, there was no statistical significance in the risk of irritable bowel syndrome between the two groups (RR=1.69, 95%CI 0.68 to 4.24, P=0.26). Conclusion Acute gastrointestinal infection within 3 years after onset was associated with the risk of IBS. Sex, diarrhea duration, bloody purulent stools and abdominal cramps at acute stage are important risk factors of intriguing the occurrence of post-infectious IBS. The acute gastrointestinal infection and IBS are not associated in the fifth year; however, more high-quality trials are needed for further verifying the aforementioned conclusion. ? 2014 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med."

However, the collection and diagnostic work-up of multiple stool samples increases costs and workload. It has been hypothesized that these increased efforts provide more accurate results when infection and drug efficacy are summarized by prevalence (proportion of subjects infected) and cure rate (CR, proportion of infected subjects that become egg-negative after drug administration), respectively, but not when these indicators are expressed in terms of infection intensity and egg reduction rate (ERR). We performed a meta-analysis of six drug efficacy trials and one epidemiological survey. We compared prevalence and intensity of infection, CR and ERR based on collection of one or two stool samples that were processed with single or duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears. We found that the accuracy of prevalence estimates and CR was lowest with the minimal sampling effort, but that this was not the case for estimating infection intensity and ERR. Hence, a single Kato-Katz thick smear is sufficient for reporting infection intensity and ERR following drug treatment. Copyright ? Cambridge University Press 2014."

A manual and electronic PubMed search of the literature was made to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of antibiotics compared with a control group (not receiving antibiotics or receiving placebo). Four RCTs were included in the final review. These four RCTs grouped a total of 2063 implants and a total of 1002 patients. Antibiotic use significantly lowered the implant failure rate (P = 0.003), with an odds ratio of 0.331, implying that antibiotic treatment reduced the odds of failure by 66.9%. The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient from having an implant failure was 48 (95% confidence interval 31-109). In contrast, antibiotic use did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative infection (P = 0.754). Based on the results of this meta-analysis, and pending further research in the field, it can be concluded that there is evidence in favour of systematic antibiotic use in patients receiving dental implants, since such treatment significantly reduces implant failure. In contrast, antibiotic use does not exert a significant preventive effect against postoperative infection. Our recommendations for future research focus on the performance of large-scale RCTs to identify the best choice of antibiotic, timing of administration, and dose. Increased effort is also required to reach consensus and define the most effective antibiotic treatment protocol for patients who are allergic to beta-lactams and for those who are not. ? 2013 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons."

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science (from January 1966 to August 2013) for all trials assessing diagnostic value of sTREM-1 for LRTI. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio(PLR), negative likelihood ratio(NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), the area under summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve and the Q* were calculated. Thirteen studies with 1138 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of sTREM-1 for diagnosis of LRTI was 0.84 and 0.77. The PLR, NLR and DOR were 3.6, 0.21 and 17. The area under SROC curve was 0.88 and the Q* was 0.82. The univariate meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the assay method for sTREM-1 significantly affected sensitivity for LRTI. The Q* of sTREM-1 for diagnosis of community-acquired LRTI was 0.82, and the area under SROC curve was 0.88. The Q* of sTREM-1 in diagnosis of hospital-acquired LRTI was 0.83, and the area under SROC curve was 0.90. The Q* of sTREM-1 for distinguishing culture-positive LRTI from culture-negative diseases was 0.79, and the area under SROC curve was 0.86.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was twofold: to answer the question ""What is the evidence for the effectiveness of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics for infection prevention in shunt surgery?"" and to make treatment recommendations based on the available evidence. Methods. The US National Library of Medicine PubMed/MEDLINE database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were queried using MeSH headings and key words relevant to prophylactic antibiotic use in children undergoing a shunt operation. Abstracts were reviewed to identify which studies met the inclusion criteria. An evidentiary table was assembled summarizing the studies and the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model to calculate a cumulative estimate of treatment effect using risk ratio (RR). Heterogeneity was assessed using chi-square and I2 statistics. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted. Based on the quality of the literature and the result of the meta-analysis, a recommendation was rendered (Level I, II, or III). Results. Nine studies (4 Class I, 3 Class II, and 2 Class III) met our inclusion criteria. Of 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 3 were downgraded from Class I to Class II because of significant quality issues, and all RCTs were potentially underpowered. In only 2 Class III retrospective cohort studies were preoperative antibiotic agents found to be protective against shunt infection. When data from the individual studies were pooled together, the infection rate in the prophylactic antibiotics group was 5.9% compared with 10.7% in the control group. Using a random-effects model, the cumulative RR was 0.55 (95% CI 0.38-0.81), indicating a protective benefit of prophylactic preoperative intravenous antibiotics. A sensitivity analysis of RCTs only (n = 7) also demonstrated a statistical benefit, but an analysis of higher-quality RCTs only (n = 4) did not. Conclusions. Within the limits of this systematic review and meta-analysis, administration of preoperative antibiotic agents for shunt surgery in children was found to lower the infection risk (quality of evidence: Class II; strength of recommendation, Level II). RECOMMENDATION: The use of preoperative antibiotic agents can be recommended to prevent shunt infection in patients with hydrocephalus. It was only by combining the results of the various underpowered studies (metaanalysis) that the use of preoperative antibiotics for shunt surgery in children was shown to lower the risk of shunt infection. STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION: Level II, moderate degree of clinical certainty. ?AANS, 2014."

We carried out a systematic review of the literature in order to perform a meta-analysis about this issue. An unrestricted search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library up to 31 December 2013 was performed. Overall, seven high-methodological quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis, resulting in 1310 patients totally. The incidence of abdominal collections, wound infection and overall mortality according to the presence or absence of the sub-hepatic drainage were meta-analyzed. Sub-hepatic drainage showed an increase in the abdominal collection rate in patients who underwent elective uncomplicated LC (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.00-2.43) if compared to patients without drainage. A non-significant correlation was found in overall mortality and infection rates. The meta-analysis shows that the presence of the sub-hepatic drainage does not reduce the incidence of abdominal collection after uncomplicated LC, whereas it does not influence wound infection and mortality rates, postoperative pain and hospital stay. ? 2014 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery."

A predefined electronic databases search was performed to identify eligible studies for the analysis of hair Zn, Cu or Fe levels in Chinese children with RRI. Thirteen studies were included. RRI patients displayed significantly lower levels of hair Zn (13 studies, random effects SMD:-1.215, 95% CI:-1.704 to-0.725, p < 0.0001), Cu (11 studies, random effects SMD:-0.384, 95% CI:-0.717 to-0.052, p = 0.023) and Fe (12 studies, random effects SMD:-0.569, 95% CI:-0.827 to-0.312, p < 0.0001) compared with controls.

Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials were identified by searching Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database until 15 July 2013. All included studies were critically appraised and analysed with the use of Review Manager 5.1.0 software according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement protocol. Twenty randomized and double-blinded studies published in 22 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis.

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to describe the benefits and risks of TGC with IIT in critically ill children and explore differences between published studies. Methods: Prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TGC with IIT in critically ill children admitted to the ICU were identified through a search of MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews as well as detailed citation review of relevant primary and review articles. RCTs of TGC with IIT in critically ill adults and preterm neonates were excluded.

Meta-analytic techniques were used for analysis of outcomes including 30-day mortality, acquired infection, and incidence of hypoglycemia. Results: We identified four RCTs of TGC with IIT in critically ill children that included 3288 subjects. Overall, TGC with IIT did not result in a decrease in 30-day mortality [odds ratio (OR): 0.79; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-1.15, p=0.22].

However, this risk has received little attention to date. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the evidence for an association between domestic exposure to food-producing animals and cases of human diarrhea and specific enteric infections. We performed a systematic review of available literature to examine domestic livestock and poultry as risk factors for diarrhea and applied pre-determined quality criteria. Where possible, we carried out meta-analysis of specific animal-pathogen pairs. We found consistent evidence of a positive association between exposure to domestic food-producing animals and diarrheal illness across a range of animal exposures and enteric pathogens. Out of 29 studies included in the review, 20 (69.0%) reported a positive association between domestic animal exposure and diarrhea. Domestic exposure to poultry revealed a substantial association with human campylobacteriosis (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.90-3.93). Our results suggest that domestic poultry and livestock exposures are associated with diarrheal illness in humans. Failure to ascertain the microbial cause of disease may mask this effect. Exposure to domestic animals should be considered a risk factor for human diarrheal illness and additional studies may identify potential mitigation strategies to address this risk. ?

An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in March 2014. Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomised or not. The search strategy resulted in 14 publications. The I2 statistic was used to express the percentage of the total variation across studies due to heterogeneity. The inverse variance method was used with a fixed- or random-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity. The estimates of relative effect were expressed in risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval. Six studies were judged to be at high risk of bias, whereas one study was considered at moderate risk, and six studies were considered at low risk of bias. The test for overall effect showed that the difference between the procedures (use versus non-use of antibiotics) significantly affected the implant failure rates (P = 0¡P0002), with a RR of 0¡P55 (95% CI 0¡P41-0¡P75). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one patient having an implant failure was 50 (95% CI 33-100). There were no apparent significant effects of prophylactic antibiotics on the occurrence of post-operative infections in healthy patients receiving implants (P = 0¡P520). A sensitivity analysis did not reveal difference when studies judged as having high risk of bias were not considered. The results have to be interpreted with caution due to the presence of several confounding factors in the included studies. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Methods The authors collected studies that have compared hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) and open surgery for the treatment of colorectal disease over the past 17 years. Data of interest for HALS and open surgery were subjected to meta-analysis. Results Twelve studies that included 1,362 patients were studied. In total, 2.66% of HALS procedures were converted to laparotomy. Compared with the open surgery group, blood loss, rate of wound infection, and ileus in the HALS group decreased, and incision length, recovery of gastrointestinal function, and hospitalization period were shorter. There were no significant differences in operating time, hospitalization costs, mortality, and complications, including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and anastomotic leak, between the groups. Conclusions HALS has the advantages of minimal invasion, lower blood loss, shorter incision length, and faster recovery, and it can shorten the length of hospitalization without an increase in costs. The drawbacks are that a small number of patients who undergo HALS may need to be converted to laparotomy, and the oncologic safety and long-term prognosis are not clear. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

High-quality relevant evidence is limited. Methods A systematic review of electronic information sources was undertaken, with the objective of identifying randomized trials that compared single-incision with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy. Outcome measures included 30-day morbidity, abdominal abscess, wound infection, open conversion, reoperation, operative time, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to calculate combined overall effect sizes of pooled data. Data are presented as odds ratios or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Five randomized trials were identified, with a total of 746 patients. Thirty-day morbidity (9.6% vs 8.6%; odds ratio, 1.14; 95% CI,.69 to 1.89) and wound infection rates were similar between single-incision and conventional laparoscopy (4.0% vs 4.8%; odds ratio,.83; 95% CI,.41 to 1.68), whereas the duration of surgery was longer in the single-incision group (46.3 vs 40.7 minutes; weighted mean difference, 6.01; 95% CI, 2.26 to 9.76).

Whether or not the use of protease inhibitors (PIs) confers additional risk for AVN to HIV-infected patients is controversial. Previous epidemiological studies showed an increased risk of AVN among PI users, but these studies did not have enough power to achieve statistical significance. A meta-analysis of case-control studies reporting the odds ratios (ORs) of AVN among HIV-infected patients who were exposed to PIs compared with non-exposed patients was conducted. Pooled ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effect Mantel-Haenszel analysis. Four case-control studies were identified and included for data analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated an increased odds of AVN in participants exposed to PIs, with an OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.01-4.31; P = 0.05). The statistical heterogeneity of this meta-analysis was determined not to be important, with an I2 of 0%.

We conducted a comprehensive, systematic bibliographic search of medical literature to identify relevant studies. We calculated summary relative risk (SRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between each STI and PC through random effect models. Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were carried out to detect between-study heterogeneity and bias. We included 47 studies published between 1971 and 2011.

The 2 techniques most frequently used are the onlay repair and sublay repair. However, it remains unclear which technique is superior. DATA SOURCES: A meta-analysis was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The quality of the nonrandomized studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Of 178 articles, 10 articles (2 randomized controlled trials, 1 prospective study, and 7 retrospective studies) comprising a total of 1,948 patients (775 onlay operations and 1173 sublay operations) were selected. Two of the studies scored below 5 points on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and were not selected. A trend was observed for IH recurrence in favor of sublay repair (odds ratio = 2.41; 95% confidence interval,.99 to 5.88; I2 = 70%; P =.05). Surgical site infection occurred significantly less after sublay repair (odds ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 5.74; I2 = 16%; P =.05).

OBJECTIVE: To review the world literature and perform a meta-analysis of studies comparing wound infection rates with antibiotic use in breast reduction surgery. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Clinical Trials, Embase and CINAHL databases. Subject headings and relevant subheadings for ""Breast"", ""Breast Reduction"", ""Reduction Mammaplasty"", ""Mammaplasty"" were combined with ""Antibiotics"" and ""Antibacterial Agents"". The list of titles was assessed by the study's authors and abstracts were reviewed. All relevant articles were then independently reviewed by the two primary authors, and Jadad scoring was used to assess the quality of the included articles. RESULTS: From the original search, three randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis of preoperative antibiotics. The metaanalysis revealed a 75% reduction in wound infections with preoperative antibiotics (OR 0.25 [95% CI 0.09 to 0.72]). Because only one randomized controlled trial analyzed postoperative antibiotics, no meta-analysis could be performed.

Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomized or not.Results 2768 studies were identified in the search strategy and 22 studies were included. The estimates of relative effect were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) in millimetres. All studies were judged to be at high risk of bias, none were randomized. A total of 10,927 dental implants were inserted in PCPs (587 failures; 5.37%), and 5881 implants in PHPs (226 failures; 3.84%). The difference between the patients significantly affected the implant failure rates (RR 1.78, 95% CI 1.50-2.11; P < 0.00001), also observed when only the controlled clinical trials were pooled (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.38-2.80; P = 0.0002). There were significant effects of dental implants inserted in PCPs on the occurrence of postoperative infections (RR 3.24, 95% CI 1.69-6.21; P = 0.0004) and in marginal bone loss (MD 0.60, 95% CI 0.33-0.87; P < 0.0001) when compared to PHPs.Conclusions The present study suggests that an increased susceptibility for periodontitis may also translate to an increased susceptibility for implant loss, loss of supporting bone, and postoperative infection. The results should be interpreted with caution due to the presence of uncontrolled confounding factors in the included studies, none of them randomized.Clinical Significance There is some evidence that patients treated for periodontitis may experience more implant loss and complications around implants including higher bone loss and peri-implantitis than non-periodontitis patients.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2014,Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology,10.3109/00365521.2014.887765,24611790,"Objectives. To evaluate the available data on the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin-based triple therapy compared with standard triple therapy in first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. Methods. By searching MEDLINE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Knowledge, two independent reviewers systemically identified randomized controlled trials comparing levofloxacin-based triple regimen with standard triple therapy for first-line treatment of H. pylori infection. The pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Results. Overall, nine randomized controlled trials including 1275 patients have been treated with levofloxacin-based triple therapy and 1237 patients with standard regimen. Eradication rate in the levofloxacin-based therapy group was slightly higher than that in the standard triple therapy group regardless of treatment duration (80.2% vs. 77.4%, RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94-1.13). Subgroup analysis related to different geographic areas found that efficacy of 7-day standard triple regimen was statistically superior to 7-day levofloxacin-based scheme in Asian group (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.86-0.97), but levofloxacin-based triple therapy was predominant regardless of treatment time in European countries (RR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.23). There was no significant difference between two groups in the incidence of overall adverse events or in the occurrence of discontinuing therapy due to side effects. Conclusions. The 10-day levofloxacin-based triple therapy may be considered as an alternative for increasing cure rate of H. pylori infection in European areas. But in Asian countries, standard triple regimen is still superior to levofloxacin-based therapy as first-line regimen for H. pylori eradication. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare."

Random effects meta-analyses were used to calculate a pooled prevalence of any HPV and high-risk (HR) HPV.Results A total of 11 studies comprising 9342 men were identified. We found that HPV is very common among men in sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of any HPV ranging between 19.1% and 100%. Using random effects meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of any HPV was 78.2% (95% CI 54.2 to 91.6) among HIV-positive and 49.4% (95% CI 30.4 to 68.6) among HIV-negative men (p=0.0632). When restricting the analyses to PCRbased studies, the pooled prevalence of any HPV was 84.5% (95% CI 74.2 to 91.2) among HIV-positive and 56.4% (95% CI 49.7 to 62.9) among HIV-negative men (p<0.0001). Of the HPV types included in the ninevalent HPV vaccine, the most common HR HPV types were HPV16 and HPV52, and HPV6 was the most common low-risk HPV type. When examining the prevalence of HPV in relation to age no clear trend was observed.Conclusions The prevalence of HPV is high among men in sub-Saharan Africa, which could contribute to the high rates of penile and cervical cancer in this part of the world.

This study aimed to meta-analyze whether probiotics supplementation in triple therapy could improve H. pylori eradication rates and reduce therapy-related side effects in children. Electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials in pediatric patients comparing probiotics supplementation with placebo or no extra intervention in H. pylori eradication therapy. Two authors independently extracted the data. Results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and accompanying 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Stata version 12.0 was used to perform all statistical analyses. Seven studies consisting of 508 pediatric patients were included in our study. The pooled ORs (studies n = 7) of eradication rates by intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis in the probiotics group versus the control group were 1.96 (95 % CI 1.28-3.02) and 2.25 (95 % CI 1.41-3.57), respectively. The pooled OR (studies n = 5) of incidence of total side effects was 0.32 (95 % CI 0.13-0.79), with significant heterogeneity observed (I 2 = 71.9 %).

The role of fibrin sealants in decreasing the risk of POPF remains debatable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the literature regarding the effectiveness of fibrin sealants in pancreatic surgery. Methods A comprehensive database search was conducted. Only randomized controlled trials comparing fibrin sealants with standard care were included. A meta-analysis regarding POPF, intra-abdominal collections, post-operative haemorrhage, pancreatitis and wound infections was performed according to the recommendations of the Cochrane collaboration. Results Seven studies were included, accounting for 897 patients. Compared with controls, patients receiving fibrin sealants had a pooled odds ratio (OR) of developing a POPF of 0.83 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-1.14], P = 0.245. There was a trend towards a reduction in post-operative haemorrhage (OR = 0.43 (95%CI: 0.18-1.0), P = 0.05) and intra-abdominal collections (OR = 0.52 (95%CI: 0.25-1.06), P = 0.073) in those patients receiving fibrin sealants. No difference was observed in terms of mortality, wound infections, re-interventions or hospital stay.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine cure proportions with systemic antibiotics, antibiotic lock solution, and guidewire exchange. We searched databases and registries; conference proceedings from relevant medical societies; and article reference lists. Data regarding management approach, cure, follow-up, recurrence, complications, and microbiology were abstracted and pooled from 28 selected publications. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated from a mixed effects logistic regression model. In total, 1596 patients with tunneled hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia were divided into groups on the basis of treatment with systemic antibiotics (n=697), antibiotic lock solution (n=546), or guidewire exchange ( n=353). Antibiotic lock solution and guidewire exchange had similar cure proportions that were superior to systemic antibiotics alone (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.45; P<0.01 for antibiotic lock solution; OR, 2.88; 95%CI, 1.82 to 4.55; P<0.001 for guidewire exchange versus systemic antibiotics). Cure proportions were highest for coagulase-negative staphylococci followed by gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus. Among S. aureus infections, guidewire exchange led to a higher cure proportion than systemic antibiotics or antibiotic lock solution (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.17 to 9.46; P=0.02; OR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.79 to 12.46; P=0.002, respectively). Thus, results of this study suggest that tunneled hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia should be treated with either guidewire exchange or antibiotic lock solution. Future studies should address prospectively whether one strategy is better than the other overall and for specific pathogens. Copyright ? 2014 by the American Society of Nephrology."

Whether this holds true for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is matter of controversy. Aim To review the association between host genomics and spontaneous or interferon-induced clearance of HBV with specific reference to the recently identified interleukin 28B gene now renamed IFN-£f3. Methods A literature search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science for English articles and abstracts using free text words and combinations of the following terms 'IL28B', 'IFN lambda', 'genomics', 'hepatitis B virus', 'interferon' 'GWAS', 'treatment', 'SNPs', 'HLA', 'polymorphisms'. Results Genome-wide association studies convincingly demonstrated an association between SNPs in the HLA locus and spontaneous resolution of HBV infection in subgroups of Asian patients, yet no information is available for Caucasians. The preliminary observations of an association between IFN-£f3 SNP and virological and serological responses to IFN in both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients could not be replicated by subsequent studies. Yet, majority of studies performed so far suffer several limitations in terms of sample size, selection of the patients, endpoints of therapy, treatment strategies and duration of follow-up. Conclusions While host genetics is associated with an increased likelihood of spontaneous clearance of HBV among genotype B/C patients, the relationship between IFN-£f3 polymorphisms and response to IFN has not been confirmed. Further studies in large cohorts of homogeneous patients are required, before this genetic test can be recommended in clinical practice. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America, on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis (continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment, independent of the occurrence of death) and death from VL. The limitations of the existing knowledge, the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented.Methods/Principal Findings:The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools. Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis. Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures, patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes, and the results of multivariate analyses. The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and age >40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far.Conclusions/Significance:Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes.

Materials and Methods: Retrospective and prospective studies enrolling patients with a body mass index greater than 30 kg/m 2 were included. Primary outcomes were days of hospital stay, surgical procedure duration, and overall post-operative complication rate. Secondary outcomes were wound infection and intra-abdominal abscesses formation rate, hospital charges. Results: Laparoscopic appendectomy showed to be significantly associated with lower wound infection (P &lt; 0.001) and post-operative complication rate (P &lt; 0.001). Surgical time was considered as a hallmark of technical challenge and resulted diminished in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.018). Although not clinically relevant per se, the statistically significant shorter hospital stay (P &lt; 0.001) was probably the reason of decreased hospital charges (P &lt; 0.001).

This policy is predicated on meta-analyses suggesting decreased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, but these meta-analysesmay be misleading because of lack of distinction between cardiac surgery and non-cardiac surgery studies, conflation of open-label vs double-blind investigations, and insufficient emphasis on patient-centered outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the impact of routine oral care with chlorhexidine on patient-centered outcomes in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, andWeb of Science from inception until July 2013 without limits on date or language. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials comparing chlorhexidine vs placebo in adults receiving mechanical ventilation. Of 171 unique citations, 16 studies including 3630 patients met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Eligible trials were independently identified, evaluated for risk of bias, and extracted by 2 investigators. Differences were resolved by consensus.We stratified studies into cardiac surgery vs non-cardiac surgery and open-label vs double-blind investigations. Eligible studies were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ventilator-associated pneumonia, mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS There were fewer lower respiratory tract infections in cardiac surgery patients randomized to chlorhexidine (relative risk [RR], 0.56 [95%CI, 0.41-0.77]) but no significant difference in ventilator-associated pneumonia risk in double-blind studies of non-cardiac surgery patients (RR, 0.88 [95%CI, 0.66-1.16]). There was no significant mortality difference between chlorhexidine and placebo in cardiac surgery studies (RR, 0.88 [95%CI, 0.25-2.14]) and nonsignificantly increased mortality in non-cardiac surgery studies (RR, 1.13 [95%CI, 0.99-1.29]). There were no significant differences in mean duration of mechanical ventilation or intensive care length of stay. Data on hospital length of stay and antibiotic prescribing were limited. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Routine oral care with chlorhexidine prevents nosocomial pneumonia in cardiac surgery patients but may not decrease ventilator-associated pneumonia risk in non-cardiac surgery patients. Chlorhexidine use does not affect patient-centered outcomes in either population. Policies encouraging routine oral care with chlorhexidine for non-cardiac surgery patients merit reevaluation. ? 2014 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."

We reviewed studies that examined the effect of CPT on incidence of malaria in children in sub-Saharan Africa. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies on the effect of CPT on incidence of malaria and mortality in children and extracted data on the prevalence of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance-conferring point mutations. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) from individual studies were combined using random effects meta-analysis; confounder-adjusted estimates were used for cohort studies. The importance of resistance was examined in meta-regression analyses. Three RCTs and four cohort studies with 5039 children (1692 HIV-exposed; 2800 HIV-uninfected; 1486 HIV-infected) were included. Children on CPT were less likely to develop clinical malaria episodes than those without prophylaxis (combined IRR 0.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.21-0.66), but there was substantial between-study heterogeneity (I-squared = 94%, P < 0.001). The protective efficacy of CPT was highest in an RCT from Mali, where the prevalence of antifolate resistant plasmodia was low. In meta-regression analyses, there was some evidence that the efficacy of CPT declined with increasing levels of resistance. Mortality was reduced with CPT in an RCT from Zambia, but not in a cohort study from C?te d'Ivoire. Cotrimoxazole prophylactic treatment reduces incidence of malaria and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa, but study designs, settings and results were heterogeneous.

BACKGROUND: The conclusions of studies examining the association between preoperative smoking and postoperative complications are inconsistent, thus there is a need for a review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on a search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Included were original studies of the association between smoking status and postoperative complications occurring within 30 days of operation. In total, 9354 studies were identified and reviewed for eligibility and data were extracted. Forest plots and summarized relative risks (RR) including 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for various complication types. RESULTS: Of the 9354 identified studies, 107 studies were included in the meta-analyses and based on these, 157 data sets were extracted. Preoperative smoking was associated with an increased risk of various postoperative complications including general morbidity (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.33-1.74), wound complications (RR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.87-2.49), general infections (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.32-1.79), pulmonary complications (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.35-2.23), neurological complications (RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.01-1.88), and admission to intensive care unit (RR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.14-2.25). Preoperative smoking status was not observed to be associated with postoperative mortality, cardiovascular complications, bleedings, anastomotic leakage, or allograft rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative smoking was found to be associated with an increased risk of the following postoperative complications: general morbidity, wound complications, general infections, pulmonary complications, neurological complications, and admission to the intensive care unit.

Surgical interventions for medically refractory epilepsy are effective in selected patients, but they are underutilized. There remains a lack of pooled data on complication rates and their changes over a period of multiple decades. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported complications from intracranial epilepsy surgery from 1980 to 2012. Methods. A literature search was performed to find articles published between 1980 and 2012 that contained at least 2 patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups depending on the procedure they underwent: A) temporal lobectomy with or without amygdalohippocampectomy, B) extratemporal lobar or multilobar resections, or C) invasive electrode placement. Articles were divided into 2 time periods, 1980-1995 and 1996-2012. Results. Sixty-one articles with a total of 5623 patients met the study's eligibility criteria. Based on the 2 time periods, neurological deficits decreased dramatically from 41.8% to 5.2% in Group A and from 30.2% to 19.5% in Group B. Persistent neurological deficits in these 2 groups decreased from 9.7% to 0.8% and from 9.0% to 3.2%, respectively. Wound infections/meningitis decreased from 2.5% to 1.1% in Group A and from 5.3% to 1.9% in Group B. Persistent neurological deficits were uncommon in Group C, although wound infections/meningitis and hemorrhage/hematoma increased over time from 2.3% to 4.3% and from 1.9% to 4.2%, respectively. These complication rates are additive in patients undergoing implantation followed by resection. Conclusions. Complication rates have decreased dramatically over the last 30 years, particularly for temporal lobectomy, but they remain an unavoidable consequence of epilepsy surgery. Permanent neurological deficits are rare following epilepsy surgery compared with the long-term risks of intractable epilepsy. ?AANS, 2014."

These studies have often included pre and post-operative regimens and have utilized inconsistent controls ranging from standard non-supplemented oral diets to high-quality isonitrogenous controls. This study aims to compare outcomes after preoperative nutritional supplementation with IN vs. standard oral nutritional supplements (ONS) or a regular diet without supplements. We performed a systematic literature review. 8 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of preoperative IN vs. ONS were identified and 9 RCTs of IN vs. no supplements were also identified. Meta-analysis was performed for reported outcomes including wound infection, infectious and non-infectious complications, and length of stay (LOS). The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with Preferred Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. We identified 561 patients in 8 RCTs of preoperative IN vs. ONS. 895 patients were identified in 9 RCTs of IN vs. no supplements. When compared to ONS, preoperative IN was not associated with reduced wound infection (OR 0.97, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.45 to 2.11), all infectious complications (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.68), non-infectious complications (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.43), or LOS (mean difference 0.07 days, 95% CI 2.29 to 2.43). In RCTs controlled with non-supplemented standard diets, preoperative IN was associated with decreased infectious complications (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.83, p0.01) and LOS (mean difference 2.22 days, 95% CI 2.99 to 1.45, p0.01). In conclusion, there was no evidence for IN to be superior to ONS on several key clinical outcomes. Therefore standard ONS may offer an alternative to IN for preoperative nutritional supplementation."

Data were pooled using fixed and random-effects models. Primary outcomes were rate of healing, recurrence, wound infection and dehiscence. Twenty-five trials (2,949 patients) were included.Results: Four trials compared limited versus radical open healing. Although recurrence rate did not differ, all other outcomes favored the limited approach. Ten studies compared midline versus off-midline primary closure; wound infection and dehiscence were significantly higher after midline closure. Six RCT compared Karydakis/Bascom versus Limberg. No difference was found in recurrence or wound complications rate. Six RCT compared sinusectomy/sinotomy versus primary closure. Recurrence rate was significantly lower after sinusectomy/sinotomy; no significant differences were found in other outcomes.Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggest that some of the questions of which is the best surgical technique for CPD have now been answered: open radical excision and primary midline closure should be abandoned. Sinusotomy/sinectomy or en bloc resection with off midline primary closure are the preferred approaches. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Italia."

Methods: A search of Medline (1946-January 2014), Embase (1950-January 2014), and The Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials of canagliflozin compared to placebo or active comparator in T2DM was performed. Clinical Trials website and unpublished U.S. Food and Drug Administration data were also searched. Results: Ten trials including 6,701 patients were analyzed. Compared with placebo, canagliflozin produced absolute reductions in glycated hemoglobin A<inf>1c</inf> levels when used as monotherapy (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.08 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) [-1.25 to -0.90], p < 0.00001) or add-on treatment (WMD -0.73 %, 95 %CI [-0.84 to -0.61], p < 0.00001). When compared with other active comparators, canagliflozin significantly reduced HbA1c by -0.21 % (WMD, 95 %CI [-0.33 to -0.08], p = 0.001). Canagliflozin led to greater body weight loss (vs. placebo, WMD -2.81 kg, 95 %CI [-3.26 to -2.37]; vs. active comparators, WMD -3.49 kg, 95 %CI [-4.86 to -2.12]). Hypoglycemia with canagliflozin was similar to placebo or sitagliptin, and was lower than glimepiride (risk ratio (RR) 0.15, 95 %CI [0.10 to 0.22]). Genital tract infections were more common with canagliflozin (vs. placebo, RR 3.76, 95 %CI [2.23 to 6.35]; vs. active comparators, RR 4.95, 95 %CI [3.25 to 7.52]). Similar incidences of urinary tract infections were noted with canagliflozin compared with control groups. Conclusion: Canagliflozin led to improvements in reducing glycated hemoglobin A<inf>1c</inf> levels and body weight with low risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM. Common adverse effects including genital tract infections and osmotic diuresis-related AEs were identified and reviewed. Risks of cardiovascular events are even less certain, and more data on long-term effects are needed. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor and exhibits synergistic immunosuppressive activity with CNI to permit CNI-reduction. We conducted a systematic review to compare the efficacy of everolimus-based CNI sparing and standard CNI regimens in renal transplantation recipients. Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), death or graft loss and incidence of adverse events were the major estimates of renal function, efficacy, and tolerability of the two regimens. Results: Seven studies providing data for 2,067 patients were included. Six of the seven studies used cyclosporine as the CNI. The patients were divided into two groups: everolimus-based CNI sparing (elimination and minimization) group and standard CNI group. Everolimus-based regimen was associated with increased GFR [P = 0.02; weighted mean difference (WMD) 4.83 mL/min], decreased serum creatinine (P = 0.004; WMD -9.94 £gmol/L) and no more death or graft loss [P = 0.72; relative risk (RR) 1.07]. CNI-minimization was not associated with increased BPAR (P = 0.25; RR 0.85) while CNI-elimination was associated with more BPAR Grade 1 (P < 0.00001; RR 4.20). Use of everolimus reduced the risk of CMV infection (P = 0.0002; RR 0.47). There was a higher risk of discontinuation of everolimus (P < 0.00001; RR 1.69) and non-fatal adverse events (P < 0.00001; RR 1.73) in patients on the everolimus based CNI sparing regimens. Conclusions: Everolimus-based CNI sparing regimen could optimize long-term graft function without leading to more death or graft loss. Although CNI elimination was associated with higher risk of BPAR, everolimus use with CNI minimization did not increase the risk of acute rejections. Use of everolimus was associated with reduction in the incidence of CMV infection, but there was a higher risk of discontinuation of this drug and other non-fatal adverse events. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

A consensus on outcomes of LIVHR when compared with OIVHR has not been reached. Methods: As the basis for the present study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials comparing LIVHR and OIVHR. Results: Eleven studies involving 1,003 patients were enrolled. The incidences of wound infection were significantly lower in the laparoscopic group than that in the open group (laparoscopic group 2.8 %, open group 16.2 %; RR = 0.19, 95 % CI 0.11-0.32; P < 0.00001). The rates of wound drainage were significantly lower in the laparoscopic group than that in the open group (laparoscopic group 2.6 %, open group 67.0 %; RR = 0.06, 95 % CI 0.03-0.09; P < 0.00001). However, the rates of bowel injury were significantly higher in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (laparoscopic group 4.3 %, open group 0.81 %; RR = 3.68, 95 % CI 1.56-8.67; P = 0.003). There were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidences of hernia recurrence, postoperative seroma, hematoma, bowel obstruction, bleeding, and reoperation. Descriptive analyses showed a shorter length of hospital stay in the laparoscopic group. Conclusions: Laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair is a feasible and effective alternative to the open technique. It is associated with lower incidences of wound infection and shorter length of hospital stay. However, caution is required because it is associated with an increased risk of bowel injury compared with the open technique. Given the relatively short follow-up duration of trials included in the systematic review, trials with long-term follow-up are needed to compare the durability of laparoscopic and open repair. ? 2014 Soci?t?

Promising new regimens that may be more effective are being introduced. Because few regimens can be directly compared, network meta-analyses, which allow indirect comparisons to be made, strengthen conclusions.Purpose: To determine the most efficacious regimen for preventing active TB with the lowest likelihood of adverse events to inform LTBI treatment policies.Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to 29 January 2014; clinical trial registries; and conference abstracts.Study Selection: Randomized, controlled trials that evaluated LTBI treatment in humans and recorded at least 1 of 2 prespecified end points (preventing active TB or hepatotoxicity), without language or date restrictions.Data Extraction: Data from eligible studies were independently extracted by 2 investigators according to a standard protocol.Data Synthesis: Of the 1516 articles identified, 53 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data on 15 regimens were available; of 105 possible comparisons, 42 (40%) were compared directly. Compared with placebo, isoniazid for 6 months (odds ratio [OR], 0.64 [95% credible interval {CrI}, 0.48 to 0.83]) or 12 months or longer (OR, 0.52 [CrI, 0.41 to 0.66]), rifampicin for 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.41 [CrI, 0.18 to 0.86]), and rifampicin-isoniazid regimens for 3 to 4 months (OR, 0.52 [CrI, 0.34 to 0.79]) were efficacious within the network.Limitations: The risk of bias was unclear for many studies across various domains. Evidence was sparse for some comparisons, particularly hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: Comparison of different LTBI treatment regimens showed that various therapies containing rifamycins for 3 months or more were efficacious at preventing active TB, potentially more so than isoniazid alone.

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2014,AIDS Reviews,,25300622,"An increased prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis has been observed in HIV-infected cohorts. We investigated the effect of bisphosphonates on bone mineral density in adults with HIV infection. Outcomes of interest were bone mineral density changes measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip, and adverse events. Data were pooled using the fixed-effects model. We identified eight randomized controlled trials meeting our inclusion criteria, involving 328 participants. Five trials compared alendronate with placebo or no intervention; in three trials the intervention arm received zoledronate. A significant increase in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine was observed in the bisphosphonate group at 48 weeks (MD: 2.84%; 95% Cl: 2.11-3.57) and 96 weeks (MD: 6.76%; 95% Cl: 4.98-8.54); analogously, bisphosphonates were associated with an increase in total hip bone mineral density at 48 weeks (MD: 2.12%; 95% Cl: 1.43-2.81) and 96 weeks (MD: 3.2%; 95% Cl: 1.52-4.88). Bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated; no drug-related withdrawals were reported in the five randomized controlled trials assessing alendronate, whereas two patients out of 104 receiving zoledronate experienced acute-phase reactions. In conclusion, administration of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates was associated with increased bone mineral density at the lumbar spine and total hip over two years in HI V-positive patients. However, none of the included trials were long enough to detect the impact of bisphosphonates on a clinically important outcome such as fracture risk.

This study assessed the effects of reamed vs unreamed intramedullary nailing for closed tibial fractures. The authors searched PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials from January 1980 to June 2012 comparing reamed with unreamed intramedullary nailing for closed tibial fracture in adults. Primary outcomes were nonunion, delayed union, malunion, secondary procedure, failure of implants, compartment syndrome, infection, and knee pain. Eight randomized and 1 quasi-randomized clinical trials (1229 fractures) were included. No statistically significant differences were found between reamed and unreamed nailing groups in delayed union (P=.20), malunion (P=.28), infection (P=.36), compartment syndrome (P=.36), and knee pain (P=.93). The unreamed group had a higher rate of fracture nonunion than the reamed group (P=.02). The subgroup analysis of implant failures (broken screws vs broken nails) indicated that reamed nailing significantly reduced the risk of screw breakage (P<.001); however, there was no significant difference between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing in nail breakage (P=.94). The subgroup analysis of a secondary procedure showed that the reamed intramedullary nailing resulted in significantly lower risks of implant exchange (P=.01) and dynamization (P=.04); however, there was no significant difference in bone grafting rate (P=.73). Evidence comparing reamed with unreamed intramedullary nailing for closed tibial fractures indicates that reamed intramedullary nailing may lead to significantly lower risks of nonunion, screw failure, implant exchange, and dynamization without increasing operative complications."

Methods An electronic search without time or language restrictions was undertaken in March 2014. Eligibility criteria included clinical human studies, either randomized or not. The estimates of relative effect were expressed in risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) in millimeters. Results 1059 studies were identified and 11 studies were included, of which 7 were of high risk of bias, whereas four studies were of low risk of bias. The results showed that the procedure used (nonfunctional vs. functional) did not significantly affect the implant failure rates (P = 0.70), with a RR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.44-1.75). The wide CI demonstrates uncertainty about the effect size. The analysis of postoperative infection was not possible due to lack of data. No apparent significant effects of non-occlusal loading on the marginal bone loss (MD 0.01 mm, 95% CI -0.04-0.06; P = 0.74) were observed. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the differences in occlusal loading between INFL and IFL might not affect the survival of these dental implants and that there is no apparent significant effect on the marginal bone loss. Clinical Significance: There has been a controversy concerning whether dental implants should be subjected to immediate functional or nonfunctional loading. As the philosophies of treatment may alter over time, a periodic review of the different concepts is necessary to refine techniques and eliminate unnecessary procedures. This would form a basis for optimum treatment. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Effects for children over 5 years of age, and effects when coadministered with other micronutrients are uncertain. These are obstacles to scale-up. This review seeks to determine if preventive supplementation reduces mortality and morbidity for children aged 6 months to 12 years. Design: Systematic review conducted with the Cochrane Developmental, Psychosocial and Learning Problems Group. Two reviewers independently assessed studies. Meta-analyses were performed for mortality, illness and side effects. Data sources: We searched multiple databases, including CENTRAL and MEDLINE in January 2013. Authors were contacted for missing information. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Randomised trials of preventive zinc supplementation. Hospitalised children and children with chronic diseases were excluded. Results: 80 randomised trials with 205 401 participants were included. There was a small but non-significant effect on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.05)). Supplementation may reduce incidence of all-cause diarrhoea (RR 0.87 (0.85 to 0.89)), but there was evidence of reporting bias. There was no evidence of an effect of incidence or prevalence of respiratory infections or malaria. There was moderate quality evidence of a very small effect on linear growth (standardised mean difference 0.09 (0.06 to 0.13)) and an increase in vomiting (RR 1.29 (1.14 to 1.46)). There was no evidence of an effect on iron status. Comparing zinc with and without iron cosupplementation and direct comparisons of zinc plus iron versus zinc administered alone favoured cointervention for some outcomes and zinc alone for other outcomes. Effects may be larger for children over 1 year of age, but most differences were not significant. Conclusions: Benefits of preventive zinc supplementation may outweigh any potentially adverse effects in areas where risk of zinc deficiency is high. Further research should determine optimal intervention characteristics and delivery strategies."

Primary outcomes evaluated were mortality and clinical success. A total of 29 studies with 2206 patients (18 RCTs and 11 observational studies) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with intermittent boluses, use of prolonged infusion appeared to be associated with a significant reduction in mortality [pooled relative risk (RR) = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.83] and improvement in clinical success (RR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21).

A meta-analysis was performed on ASO titration in neuropsychiatric patients, including tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Included studies reported numbers of positive subjects, depending on a chosen threshold, or detailed ASO titrations. Three hundred and twenty nine studies were identified, of which 13 were eligible for meta-analysis. Due to limited available data, only tic disorders were evaluated. The odds ratio of finding an abnormal ASO titre in patients was 3.22 (95?% C.I. 1.51¡V6.88) as compared to healthy controls and 16.14 (95?% C.I. 8.11¡V32.11) as compared to non-psychiatric patients.

The outcome of using DCD organs in recipients with hepatits C virus (HCV) infection remains unclear due to the limited experience and number of publications addressing this issue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of DCD versus donation after brain death (DBD) in HCV-positive patients undergoing LT. METHODS: Studies comparing DCD versus DBD LT in HCV-positive patients were identified based on systematic searches of seven electronic databases and multiple sources of gray literature. RESULTS: The search identified 58 citations, including three studies, with 324 patients meeting eligibility criteria. The use of DCD livers was associated with a significantly higher risk of primary nonfunction (RR 5.49 [95% CI 1.53 to 19.64]; P=0.009; I 2=0%), while not associated with a significantly different patient survival (RR 0.89 [95% CI 0.37 to 2.11]; P=0.79; I2=51%), graft survival (RR 0.40 [95% CI 0.14 to 1.11]; P=0.08; I2=34%), rate of recurrence of severe HCV infection (RR 2.74 [95% CI 0.36 to 20.92]; P=0.33; I2=84%), retransplantation or liver disease-related death (RR 1.79 [95% CI 0.66 to 4.84]; P=0.25; I2=44%), and biliary complications. CONCLUSIONS: While the literature and quality of studies assessing DCD versus DBD grafts are limited, there was significantly more primary nonfunction and a trend toward decreased graft survival, but no significant difference in biliary complications or recipient mortality rates between DCD and DBD LT in patients with HCV infection. There is insufficient literature on the topic to draw any definitive conclusions. ?2014 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved."

The anatomical proximity to the cervix has led researchers to investigate whether Human Papillomavirus (HPV) has a role in the etiology of endometrial cancer. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the pooled prevalence of HPV DNA in endometrial cancer. Using meta-regression, we further analyzed whether factors such as geographical region, HPV DNA detection method, publication year and tissue type were associated with HPV prevalence. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for studies providing data on HPV prevalence in cases with endometrial cancer and in controls with normal or hyperplastic endometrial tissue. Results We identified 28 papers (29 studies) examining the prevalence of HPV DNA in tumor tissue from endometrial cancer comprising altogether 1026 cases of endometrial cancer. The HPV prevalence varied considerably from 0% to 61.1%. From the random effects meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of HPV DNA in endometrial cancer was 10.0% (95% CI: 5.2-16.2) with large between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 88.2%, p &lt; 0.0001). The meta-regression showed that HPV DNA detection method was statistically significantly associated with HPV prevalence (p = 0.0016): the pooled HPV prevalence was 6.0% (95% CI: 1.5-13.0) using general primers, 18.9% (95% CI: 8.6-32.1) using type-specific primers and 1.0% (95% CI: 0.0-3.6) using non-PCR based methods. None of the other a priori defined variables were statistically significantly associated with HPV prevalence. The pooled OR was 1.43 (95% CI: 0.68-3.00) indicating that the odds of HPV was not increased in cases versus controls.

Standard ART includes either nevirapine or efavirenz, however the efficacy of these drugs is limited in patients receiving rifampin treatment for tuberculosis (TB). We compared the efficacy and safety of nevirapine- and efavirenz-based ART regimens in patients co-infected with both HIV and TB through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out to identify clinical trials comparing the efficacy and safety of nevirapine- and efavirenz-based ART regimens in HIV-associated TB. Eligible clinical studies included at least one primary or secondary event; the primary event was virological response and secondary events were TB treatment outcomes, mortality, and safety profile. Results: This meta-analysis compared five randomized clinical trials and four retrospective clinical trials. Both included patients co-infected with HIV and TB; 833 received nevirapine, while 1424 received efavirenz. The proportion of patients achieving a virological response by the end of the follow-up was higher in the efavirenz group: plasma viral load <400 copies/ml, risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.17 (p = 0.004); plasma viral load<50 copies/ml, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.16 (p = 0.146). No significant differences were found in either mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.44-1.13, p = 0.142) or TB treatment outcomes (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.96-1.06, p = 0.766). Due to adverse advents, nevirapine-based regimens significantly increased the risk of discontinuation of assigned ART (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.81, p = 0.009). Conclusions: Although efavirenz-based ART was associated with more satisfactory virological outcomes, nevirapine-based ART could be considered an acceptable alternative for patients for whom efavirenz cannot be administered. ? 2014 The Authors."

A meta-analysis of observational studies,2014,Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica,10.1111/aogs.12254,24033121,"Objective The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer is controversial, and conflicting results have been published. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of HPV in epithelial ovarian cancer tissue. Material and methods Observational studies published until 4 March 2013 were identified in PubMed and Embase. We adhered to MOOSE guidelines and included 22 studies (case-control, cross-sectional studies). A pooled estimate of the HPV prevalence with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated based on a random effect model. In a meta-regression analysis we examined the contribution of different factors to heterogeneity. Furthermore, publication bias was evaluated. Results The pooled HPV prevalence in ovarian cancer tissue was 15.5%, but wide variation was found (0-66.7%). After stratification by geographical region, publication year, tissue type and method of HPV detection, we found that the prevalence of HPV varied most markedly by geographical area, the prevalence being 45.6% (95% CI, 31.0-60.3) in Asia, 18.5% (95% CI, 8.5-28.6) in Eastern Europe, 1.1% (95% CI, -1.6 to 3.8) in Western Europe and zero in North America. A meta-regression analysis revealed that the difference between geographical regions could not be explained by HPV detection method or type of tissue. Conclusions Great geographical variation exists in HPV prevalence in ovarian cancer tissue, which is not explained by different HPV detection methods. The results suggest that HPV is unlikely to play an important role in Western European and American women, but cannot reject a role of HPV in other populations. ? 2013 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology."

There are several configurations of PD catheter design that may impact catheter function, such as the shape of the intraperitoneal segment, the number of cuffs, and the subcutaneous configuration. This review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine whether there is a clinical advantage for one of the catheter types or configurations. Comprehensive searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library 2012, issue 10). The methodology was in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Interventional Systematic Reviews and written based on the PRISMA statement. The initial search yielded 682 hits from which 13 randomized controlled trials were identified. Outcomes of interest were as follows: catheter survival, drainage dysfunction, migration, leakage, exit-site infections, peritonitis, and catheter removal. Comparing straight vs. swan neck and single vs. double-cuffed catheters, no differences were found when results were pooled. Comparison of straight vs. coiled-tip catheters demonstrated that survival was significantly different in favor of straight catheters (hazard ratio 2.05; confidence interval 1.10-3.79, P=0.02). For surgically inserted catheters, the removal rate and survival at 1 year after insertion were significantly in favor of straight catheters.

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and other relevant databases were searched by computer and manually for published and unpublished studies on the impact of preoperative biliary drainage on patients with obstructive jaundice from 2000 to the present day. Two investigators independently selected the studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of the selected studies. Meta-analysis was performed to compare postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients between the drainage and nondrainage groups. Compared with the nondrainage group, the overall mortality, overall morbidity, infectious morbidity, incidence of wound infection, intraabdominal abscess, pancreatic fistulas, bile leak, and delayed gastric emptying in the drainage group were not significantly different. Compared with the nondrainage group, the drainage group had a drainage time of 4 weeks with an increased overall morbidity by 7% to 23%; however, the overall morbidity of the drainage group with a drainage time ?4 weeks was not significantly different. Compared with the nondrainage group, the overall mortality of the drainage group using metal stents and plastic stents as internal drainage devices was reduced by 0.5% to 6%, whereas that of the drainage group using plastic stent devices was not significantly different. In summary, preoperative drainage should be applied selectively. The drainage time should be ?4 weeks, and metal stents should be used for internal drainage."

The aim of this study was to systematically review the currently published peer-reviewed literature on robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with more than 6 months of anatomic outcome data. Methods: Studies were selected after applying predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria to a MEDLINE search. Two independent reviewers blinded to each other's results abstracted demographic data, perioperative information, and postoperative outcomes. The primary outcome assessed was anatomic success rate defined as less than or equal to pelvic organ prolapse quantification system(POP-Q) stage 1. A random effects model was performed for the meta-analysis of selected outcomes. Results: Thirteen studies were selected for the systematic review. Metaanalysis yielded a combined estimated success rate of 98.6% (95% confidence interval, 97.0%Y100%). The combined estimated rate of mesh exposure/erosion was 4.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.4%Y6.9%), and the rate of reoperation formesh revision was 1.7%. The rates of reoperation for recurrent apical and nonapical prolapse were 0.8% and 2.5%, respectively. The most common surgical complication (excluding mesh erosion) was cystotomy (2.8%), followed by wound infection (2.4%). Conclusions: The outcomes of this analysis indicate that robotic sacrocolpopexy is an effective surgical treatment of apical prolapse with high anatomic cure rate and low rate of complications.

This study is aimed to compare the efficacy of ganciclovir (GCV) and valganciclovir (VGC) for prevention and treatment of infection with CMV. Materials and Methods: After sensitive and systematic search in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and other available databases, both prospective and retrospective studies on effect of VGC and GCV in prevention and treatment of CMV disease among SOTR, which had our study criteria, were included. The pooled risk estimates were calculated using random-effects models. Results: Among 1324 title, 19 studies were included. In 11 prophylactic studies (2368 patients), the pooled risk of CMV disease (VGC relative to GCV) was 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-1.49 and in studies of liver transplant recipients, 1.53, 95% CI: 0.86-2.70. Rate of viremia eradication in VGC to GCV was 1.05, 95% CI: 0.97-1.13. In 3 treatment studies (422 patients), rate of successful treatment in VGC to GCV was 0.98, 95% CI: 0.91-1.06 and viremia eradication 0.95, CI 95% 0.77-1.16. All these values did not show statistically significantly differences between GCV and VGC. Conclusion: It can be concluded that VGC as an alternative to GCV can be used with equal efficacy in prevention and treatment of CMV disease in SOTR. ? 2014, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the available evidence regarding the effect of obesity on outcomes of free autologous breast reconstruction. Methods Pubmed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched. Obesity was defined as a BMI ? 30. Comparable data from observational studies was combined for pooled analysis and quality assessment of observational studies was performed. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria (n = 6,043 patients). Pooled data analysis demonstrated significantly higher prevalences of overall complications, recipient site complications overall, donor site complications overall, donors site wound infection, donor site seroma, abdominal bulge/hernia, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, recipient site delayed wound healing, and partial flap failure, in obese (BMI ? 30) compared with nonobese (BMI < 30) patients. A BMI of 40 was identified as a threshold at which the prevalence of complications became prohibitively high. No randomized-controlled trials were found and all studies had methodological weaknesses. Conclusions Complications in obese patients following free autologous breast reconstruction were higher than in their nonobese counterparts; however the majority of these complications were reported in the studies as being minor.

However, the results remain controversial. Thus, we did this meta-analysis to determine which treatment was more effective. Methods Databases comprising PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched to find relevant studies. The primary outcome was mortality. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. Multivariable-adjusted ORs with 95% CIs were pooled in the random effects model. Results Four prospective cohort studies and 12 retrospective cohort studies were included (n = 42942). Compared with BL monotherapy, BLM dual therapy was significantly associated with reduced mortality (adjusted OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.73, P &lt; 0.001, I2 = 3%). Subsequent subgroup analyses confirmed that BLM dual therapy was statistically superior to BL monotherapy in reduction of mortality. Sensitivity analyses strengthened the validity of the results. Conclusions In comparison with BL monotherapy, BLM dual therapy might reduce mortality risk in patients with CAP. Because this finding is based on observational studies, randomized controlled trials are required to demonstrate the usefulness of BLM dual therapy in the treatment of CAP. ? The Author 2014.

We aimed to evaluate the association of statins use with AKI risk by performing a meta-analysis. Twenty-one studies were included in our meta-analysis by searching electronic databases according to predefined criteria. No significant association between statins use and AKI risk was observed in overall populations, Caucasians, Asians, and patients undergoing cardiac and elective surgery (p=0.816, 0.981, 0.18, 0.709, and 0.122). Statins use decreased the risk of contrast-induced AKI (CIN) (p=0.005) and increased AKI risk in patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) (p=0.006). Meta-regression analyses showed almost no impact on the pooled ORs of age and study length for overall populations. Exclusion of any single study had little impact on the pooled ORs. In conclusion, statins use is not associated with the risk of AKI in overall populations, Caucasians, Asians, and patients undergoing cardiac and elective surgery. Statins use decreases the risk of CIN and may increase the risk of AKI in CAP patients. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted."

This search was performed for the years from 1980 to the present. Randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing cemented and uncemented fixation were identified. Effective data were pooled for meta-analysis. A systematic search was carried out using the EFORT website to identify the relevant arthroplasty registers.Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio for failure of the implant due to aseptic loosening for the uncemented group over 5 and 10?years were 3.41 (p?=?0.0001) and 4.73 (p?=?0.0002), respectively.

Recently, endoscopic radial artery harvesting has been popularized to improve cosmetic and perioperative outcomes. However, concerns have been raised regarding the effects on long-term survival and graft patency of this relatively novel technique. The present meta-analysis aimed to assess the safety and the efficacy of endoscopic radial artery harvesting versus the conventional open approach. METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature was performed on five electronic databases. All comparative studies on endoscopic versus open radial artery harvesting were included for analysis. Primary endpoints included mortality and recurrent myocardial infarction. Secondary endpoints included graft patency, wound infection, hematoma formation, and paresthesia. RESULTS: Twelve studies involving 3314 patients were included for meta-analysis according to predefined selection criteria. There were no statistically significant differences in overall mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or graft patency between the two surgical techniques. However, patients who underwent endoscopic harvesting were found to have significantly lower incidences of wound infection, hematoma formation, and paresthesia. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature on endoscopic harvesting of the radial artery for coronary artery bypass graft surgery is limited by relatively short follow-up periods as well as differences in patient selection and surgical techniques. In addition, there are currently no randomized controlled trials to provide robust clinical data. However, the available evidence suggests that the endoscopic approach is associated with superior perioperative outcomes without clear evidence demonstrating compromised patency or survival outcomes.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of silymarin on chronic hepatitis C virus- (HCV-) infected patients. Methods. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of silymarin in chronic HCV-infected patients up to April 1, 2014 were systematically identified in PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Results. A total of 222 and 167 patients in five RCTs were randomly treated with silymarin (or intravenous silibinin) and placebo, respectively. Serum HCV RNA relatively decreased in patients treated with silymarin compared with those administered with placebo, but no significance was found (P = 0.09). Meta-analysis of patients orally treated with silymarin indicated that the changes of HCV RNA are similar in the two groups (P = 0.19).

The C allele of P2X7 receptor gene 1513A/C polymorphism was also associated with increased susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis in Asians (C vs. A: OR 1.420, 95% CI 1.163-1.733, p= 0.001; (CC. +. AC) vs. AA: OR 1.522, 95% CI 1.186-1.953, p= 0.001). Greater association between P2X7 receptor gene 1513A/C polymorphism and susceptibility to extra-pulmonary tuberculosis with bigger ORs were found (C vs. A, OR 2.035, 95% CI 1.236-3.352, p= 0.005; CC vs. AA, OR 3.788, 95% CI 1.434-10.009, p= 0.007; AC vs. AA, OR 2.148, 95% CI 1.252-3.684, p= 0.005; (CC. +. AC) vs. AA, OR 2.386, 95% CI 1.302-4.374, p= 0.005; CC vs. (AC. +. AA), OR 2.692, 95% CI 1.242-5.836, p= 0. 012). This meta-analysis indicates that the C allele of P2X7 receptor gene 1513A/C polymorphism is a risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis in Asians, while not in Africans or Latinos and a risk for extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Further well-designed, large scale studies are required to confirm this conclusion. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V."

We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of HPV in colorectal adenocarcinomas and adenomas, and test the potential association. Methods The pooled HPV prevalence was estimated using a random effects model and the I2 statistic was used to describe the amount of heterogeneity. Potential sources of heterogeneity were evaluated by meta-regression and stratified analyses. For the studies on adenocarcinomas including control tissue, random effects estimates of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results Thirty-seven studies were included. Among the 2630 adenocarcinomas, the pooled HPV prevalence was 11.2% (95% CI, 4.9-19.6%) with substantial between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 97.2%). The HPV prevalence varied by geographical region with highest prevalence in South America (45.1%, 95% CI, 21.9-69.4%), Asia (39.2%, 95% CI, 20.3-60.0%) and the Middle East (32.2%, 95% CI, 1.1-79.3%), and by detection method with the highest HPV prevalence in PCR-based studies. In the eight case-control studies, the pooled HPV prevalence was 36.8% (95% CI, 21.3-53.8%) in adenocarcinomas and 1.6% (95% CI, 0.0-9.6%) in controls giving an OR of 6.0 (95% CI, 2.0-17.9%) for the association between HPV and colorectal cancer. Among the 415 adenomas, the pooled HPV prevalence was 5.1% (95% CI, 0.0-17.8%; I2 = 93.7%). Conclusions HPV may be associated with a subset of colorectal cancers.

We aimed to synthesise data on risk factors for incident delirium and where possible conduct meta-analysis of these. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched (January 1987-August 2013). Studies were quality rated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We used the Mantel-Haenszel and inverse variance method to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) or mean difference for individual risk factors. Results: eleven articles met inclusion criteria and were included for review. Total study population 2338 (411 patients with delirium/1927 controls). The commonest factors significantly associated with delirium were dementia, older age, co-morbid illness, severity of medical illness, infection, 'high-risk' medication use, diminished activities of daily living, immobility, sensory impairment, urinary catheterisation, urea and electrolyte imbalance and malnutrition. In pooled analyses, dementia (OR 6.62; 95% CI (confidence interval) 4.30, 10.19), illness severity (APACHE II) (MD (mean difference) 3.91; 95% CI 2.22, 5.59), visual impairment (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.03, 3.47), urinary catheterisation (OR 3.16; 95% CI 1.26, 7.92), low albumin level (MD -3.14; 95% CI -5.99, -0.29) and length of hospital stay (OR 4.85; 95% CI 2.20, 7.50) were statistically significantly associated with delirium. Conclusion: we identified risk factors consistently associated with incident delirium following admission. These factors help to highlight older acute medical inpatients at risk of developing delirium during their hospital stay. ? The Author 2014."

Primary outcomes were mild-moderate and severe postsurgical bleeding. The secondary outcomes were excessive and uncontrollable intraoperative bleeding and other postsurgical complications as wound dehiscence, erythema, wound infection.Results 1.287 publications were identified and 10 studies were included into the review. The frequencies of bleeding in the control groups in general were low (about 1%). In patients on aspirin, increased risks were seen neither with respect to mild-moderate postoperative bleeding (RR 1.1, CI 0.5-2.3), nor with respect to severe bleeding (RR 0.9, CI 0.2-4.6). The studies with patients on warfarin showed a risk for mild-moderate bleeding that was three times as high as in controls (RR 3.2, CI 1.4-7.1) and for severe bleeding that was 15 times higher (RR 14.8, CI 2.7-80.4). In general the study sizes were small and the methodological quality low. Conclusion The risk of bleeding due to a medication with aspirin seems to be negligible. With warfarin, the risk is increased; an exact estimate of the risk increase is difficult to give, because of the lack of sufficient high quality studies. A two-fold increase appears likely, the 15-fold increase is most likely due to statistical reasons arising from the rareness of the event in the small number of included patients. Stopping, bridging or continuing a medication should always be an individual decision. In accordance with guidelines from internal medicine for most patients it will be recommendable to continue with the medication. ? 2014 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology."

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the available published data support that statins as adjunctive therapy could reduce mortality associated with pneumonia and, thus, help to assess whether a randomized controlled study is warranted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis of observational studies such as cohort studies and case-control studies identified in Pubmed, Scopus, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible patients were adults with pneumonia. Studies that repor ted mor tality of pneumonia grouped by statins usage were included. Data was analyzed and pooled using Revman 5.1. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 269,739 participants were included in this study. Pooled analysis showed that statin treatment was associated with lower 30-day mortality, with an OR of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29-0.67), and an adjusted OR of 0.59 (95% CI 0.48-0.73, NNT30d = 19). Statin therapy was also associated with lower long-term (> 30 days) mortality, with an OR of 0.49 (95% CI, 0.29-0.84) and an adjusted OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51-0.82, NNTlong-term = 15). For pneumonia inpatients, the raw data demonstrated no significant benefit from statin therapy (OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.56-1.34). Adjusted data showed a marginal benefit (adjusted OR = 0.89, 95% CI, 0.81-0.97, NNTinpatient = 230). Subgroup analysis revealed that current statin users might have better outcomes than recent or past statins users. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports that patients who happen to be receiving statin therapy have less mortality from pneumonia. However, it remains unclear whether initiation of statins at time of diagnosis is beneficial. There is only modest evidence to support the value of a well-designed randomized controlled clinical trial."

Methods: HIV prevalence data from low-income and middle-income countries' military men were systematically reviewed during 2000-2012 from peer reviewed journals, clearing-house databases and the internet. Standardised data abstraction forms were used to collect information on HIV prevalence, military branch and sample size. Random effects meta-analyses were completed with the Mantel-Haenszel method comparing HIV prevalence among military populations with other men in each country. Results: 2214 studies were retrieved, of which 18 studies representing nearly 150 000 military men across 11 countries and 4 regions were included. Military male HIV prevalence across the studies ranged from 0.06% (n=22 666) in India to 13.8% (n=2733) in Tanzania with a pooled prevalence of 1.1% (n=147 591). HIV prevalence in male military populations in sub-Saharan Africa was signi ficantly higher when compared with reproductive age (15-49 years) adult men (OR: 2.8, 95% CI 1.01 to 7.81). HIV prevalence in longer-serving male military populations compared with reproductive age adult men was significantly higher (OR: 2.68, 95% CI 1.65 to 4.35). Conclusions: Our data reveals that across the different settings, the burden of HIV among militaries may be higher or lower than the civilian male populations. In this study, male military populations in sub-Saharan Africa, low-income countries and longer-serving men have signi ficantly higher HIV prevalence. Given the national security implications of the increased burden of HIV, interventions targeting military personnel in these populations should be scaled up where appropriate."

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron in this subset of patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (through December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov for single-arm studies and randomized controlled trials (RCT) that examined the effect of intravenous iron for functional iron deficiency anemia in hemodialysis patients on anemia parameters and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Studies of absolute iron deficiency were excluded. Random-effect model meta-analyses were used to compute changes in outcomes of interest. Results: We identified 34 studies (2,658 patients), representing 24 single-arm studies, and 10 parallel-arm RCT. In the analyses of the study arms, intravenous iron therapy resulted in a significant increase in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation rate, serum iron, reticulocyte hemoglobin content as well as a significant decrease in the percentage of hypochromic erythrocytes and erythropoietin dose. There were significant increases in plasma malonyldialdehyde level and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and a decrease in neutrophil respiratory burst. The analyses of the RCT revealed less robust net changes in these parameters, and there was no increased risk of adverse events including infections, cardiac events and mortality. Conclusions: Intravenous iron therapy for functional iron deficiency anemia in hemodialysis patients improves anemia parameters but exerts some effects on markers of oxidative stress that are of unclear clinical significance. The long-term safety and efficacy of this treatment strategy requires further study. ? 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel."

The objective of this review is to update evidence on efavirenz safety in HIV-infected pregnant women to inform revision of the 2013 WHO guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in low and middle-income countries. DESIGN:: A systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS:: We searched for studies reporting birth outcomes among women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy up to 10 January 2014. Relative risks of congenital anomalies comparing women exposed to efavirenz and nonefavirenz-based antiretroviral regimens were pooled using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS:: Twenty-three studies were included in this review, among which 21 reported the birth outcomes of 2026 live births among women exposed to efavirenz during the first trimester of pregnancy. Forty-four congenital anomalies were reported, giving a pooled proportion of 1.63% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.78-2.48], with only one neural tube defect. Twelve studies reported birth outcomes of women exposed to efavirenz or nonefavirenz-containing regimens during the first trimester of pregnancy. Pooled analysis found no differences in overall risks congenital anomalies between these two groups (relative risk 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.08). The incidence of neural tube defects was low, 0.05% (95% CI <0.01-0.28), and similar to incidence in the general population. DISCUSSION:: This updated analysis found no evidence of an increased risk of overall or central nervous system congenital anomalies associated with first-trimester exposure to efavirenz, similar to previous systematic reviews. This review contributed to the evidence base for the revised 2013 WHO guidelines on antiretroviral therapy, which recommend that efavirenz can be included as part of first-line therapy in adults regardless of sex, and that it can be used throughout pregnancy, including during the first trimester. However, because of the low incidence of central nervous system anomalies in the overall population and relatively small number of exposures in the current literature, continued birth outcomes prospective surveillance is warranted. ? 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health."

A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies",2014,Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma,10.1097/BOT.0b013e31829203ea,23542745,"Objectives: To determine which method of operative fixation, plate and screw, or intramedullary nails (IMN) fixation is superior for pediatric both bone forearm fractures (BBFF). Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane, from 1980 to 2011, in English. Study Selection: We selected for detailed review all studies with children or adolescents with comparative data (or individual patient data) for BBFF fixed with IMN or open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws. Selected studies also required outcomes of interest including fracture union, complications, functional outcome, cosmesis, and the need for hardware removal. Data Extraction: Data were extracted from each study; publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger statistic. Study quality was assessed using the standardized method described by Zaza et al. Data Synthesis: A DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to assess differences between dichotomous variables. A continuity correction was applied in cases of zero events. A sensitivity analysis was performed with studies that separated out older children and adolescents. Conclusions: All studies identified were observational. IMN and plate and screw constructs are acceptable options in the fixation of pediatric BBFF. The literature fails to demonstrate a difference between IMN and plate and screw constructs. Outcomes were excellent in nearly 9 of 10 patients regardless of fixation strategy. Delayed unions and nonunions were rare and slightly more common in IMN, although the difference was not statistically significant. These results suggest that complication rates are similar, although the type of complication may vary. IMN provides improved cosmesis but, in general, requires a second operation to remove hardware.

Specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can be used to treat depression, but it is not clear whether they can prevent depression in patients receiving IFN therapy for chronic HCV infection. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis by searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMBASE databases through 2013 for published results from randomized, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the utility of SSRIs in preventing IFN-induced depression in HCV patients. We analyzed data from 7 studies with a total of 662 patients. The incidence of IFN-induced major depression and depression severity were defined as primary outcomes. Sustained virologic response, completion of antiviral therapy, and tolerability were considered secondary outcomes. Results: A meta-analysis of IFN-induced major depression revealed that prophylactic SSRIs reduced the risk of depression, compared with placebo (relative risk [RR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.84; P=.005). Proportions of patients achieving a sustained virologic response (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79-1.32; P=.87) and completing antiviral therapy (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.66-1.44; P=.91) were similar between patients given SSRIs and controls. Prophylactic SSRIs were tolerated in patients with HCV during treatment. Conclusions: On the basis of a meta-analysis of 7 randomized controlled trials, prophylactic administration of SSRIs to patients with HCV significantly lowered the incidence of IFN-induced major depression, compared with placebo, and the SSRIs were well tolerated. ? 2014 AGA Institute."

Methods: Four major databases were searched together with conference abstract databases from inception to 1 December 2013, updated in PubMed on 1 June 2014. Randomized and nonrandomized studies reporting completion rates for PEP were included regardless of exposure type, age, or geographical location and data pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Results: Ninety-seven studies, reporting outcomes on 21 462 PEP initiations, were reviewed. Nonoccupational exposure to HIV was the main reason for PEP in 34 studies (n=11 840), occupational exposure in 22 studies (n=3058), sexual assault in 26 studies (n=3093), and the remainder of studies (15 studies, n=3471) reported outcomes for mixed exposures. Overall, 56.6% [95% confidence (CI) 50.9-62.2%; £n2 0.25] of people considered eligible for PEP completed the full standard 28-day course. Compared with the overall estimate of PEP completion, rates were highest for studies reporting PEP for nonoccupational exposures (65.6%, 95% CI 55.6-75.6%) and lowest for sexual assault (40.2%, 95% CI 31.2-49.2%); higher rates of PEP completion were also reported for MSM (67.2%, 95% CI 59.5-74.9%).

Conclusion: Adherence to a full 28-day course of antiretroviral drugs prescribed for PEP is poor. Efforts should be made to simplify guidelines for prescribers and support adherence for people taking PEP, with particular attention needed for adolescents and victims of sexual assault. ? 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

Noninvasive alternatives such as FibroTest/Fibrosure (FT) have been developed in order to overcome the shortcomings of liver biopsy (LB). We aimed to systematically review studies describing the diagnostic accuracy of FT for predicting CHB-related fibrosis.METHODS:MEDLINE and EMBASE searches and hand searching methods were performed to identify studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of FibroTest in HB patients using LB as a reference standard. We used a hierarchical summary receiver operating curves model and the bivariate model to produce summary receiver operating characteristic curves and pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity.RESULTS:We included 16 studies (N=2494) and 13 studies (N=1754) in the heterogenous meta-analysis for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, respectively. The area under the hierarchical summary receiver operating curve for significant liver fibrosis and for all included studies was 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.78-0.88). At the FT threshold of 0.48, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of FT for significant fibrosis were 61 (48-72%), 80 (72-86%), and 6.2% (3.3-11.9), respectively.

The use of operative site drains is considered routine all along in pancreatic surgery in order to remove any collections and to act as a warning of hemorrhage or anastomotic leakage. To date few studies investigated the potential benefit and safety of routine drainage compared with no drainage after pancreatic resection and the evidence by literature is not clear. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was carried out performing an unrestricted search in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library up to 28th February 2014. Reference lists of retrieved articles and review articles were manually searched for other relevant studies. The currently available data regarding the incidence of post-operative short-term outcomes after pancreatic resection were metaanalyzed according to the presence or absence of the intra-abdominal drainage. Results: Overall 7 studies were included in the meta-analysis, that is 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 5 non-RCTs resulting in 2704 patients totally. Intra-abdominal drainage showed to increase the PF (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.52e3.51), the total post-operative complications (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.30e1.78) and the re-admission (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06e1.61) rates. A non-significant correlation was found with the presence/absence of the drainage about biliary and enteric fistula, post-operative hemorrhage, intraabdominal infected collection, wound infection and overall mortality rates. Conclusion: The meta-analysis shows that the presence of an intra-abdominal drainage does not improve the post-operative outcome after pancreatic resection. ? 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd."

Meta-analysis suggested no significant reductions in complications (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.05), infections (IRR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.48-1.24), and overall hospital admissions (IRR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13-1.00) most likely due to lack of statistical power. We found significant reduction of total hospital costs (estimates in US dollars: -623.08; 95% CI, -745.64 to -500.53; P <.01) after the interventions. Conclusion: Studies suggested a positive association of care coordination by a multidisciplinary team approach and improved patient outcomes for long-term enteral feeding patients. However, the available evidence does not allow estimating the effectiveness of a particular intervention or team composition. ? 2013 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition."

There is disagreement about how effective antibiotic prophylaxis is for preventing recurrent cellulitis. Objective: To determine if antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing recurrent cellulitis compared to no prophylaxis using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: Studies in any language identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, TRIP database, clinical practice guidelines websites, and ongoing trials databases up to 31st August 2012. Search terms included cellulitis, erysipelas, controlled clinical trial, randomized, placebo, clinical trials, randomly, and trial. Study selection: Only controlled trials comparing antibiotic prophylaxis to no antibiotic prophylaxis in patients age 16 years and above, and after 1 or more episodes of cellulitis, were included. Data extraction and synthesis: Independent extraction of articles was done by 2 investigators using predefined data extraction templates, including study quality indicators. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42012002528. Meta-analyses were done using random-effects models. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the number of patients with a recurrence of cellulitis. Secondary outcomes were (1) the time to next episode of recurrence, (2) quality of life measures, and (3) adverse events (e.g. allergic reactions, nausea). Results: Five randomized controlled trials (n=535), with 260 patients in the intervention arm and 275 in the comparator group met our inclusion criteria. 44 patients (8%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group and 97 patients (18%) in the comparator group had an episode of cellulitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the number of patients having recurrent cellulitis, with a risk ratio (RR) of 0.46 (95% CI 0.26-0.79). None of the studies reported severe adverse effects to antibiotics. There was methodological heterogeneity amongst the studies in terms of types of antibiotic used, delivery modes, number of recurrences of cellulitis at study entry, and study quality. Conclusion and relevance: Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent recurrent cellulitis. Future research should aim to identify the ideal type, dosage, and duration of antibiotics for prophylaxis, as well as to identify the group of patients who will benefit most from antibiotic prophylaxis. ? 2014 The British Infection Association."

However, limited literatures have been reviewed to synthesize the finding of previous papers to investigate the risk factors for VAP although it has been a serious complication of mechanical ventilation (MV) with a high morbidity and mortality in the newborn. We performed this meta-analysis to extend previous knowledge for developing VAP prevention strategies by identifying the potential risk factors related to VAP in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The relevant literatures published up to July 2013 were searched in the databases of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and Web of Science. Three reviewers screened those literatures and extracted data according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria independently. A total of eight studies including 370 cases and 1,071 controls were identified. Ten risk factors were found to be related to neonatal VAP which were listed as follows in order by odds ratios (ORs): length of stay in NICU (OR 23.45), reintubation (OR 9.18), enteral feeding (OR 5.59), mechanical ventilation (OR 4.04), transfusion (OR 3.32), low birth weight (OR 3.16), premature infants (OR 2.66), parenteral nutrition (OR 2.30), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR 2.21), and tracheal intubation (OR 1.12). Conclusion: We identified ten variables as independent risk factors for the development of VAP: length of stay in NICU, reintubation, enteral feeding, mechanical ventilation, transfusion, low birth weight, premature infants, parenteral nutrition, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and tracheal intubation. Due to several limitations in the present study, further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm the conclusion. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag."

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficiency of minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed through PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library database without restriction to regions, publication types, or languages. Nine studies that compared laparoscopic/robotic with open pancreaticoduodenectomy were included. Fixed or random-effects models was used to measure the pooled estimates. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate the study quality. Results: Patients who underwent minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy experienced longer operative time (P=0.007), but the estimated blood loss (P=0.007), length of stay, (P=0.02), and wound infection (P=0.04) decreased. Perioperative complications, such as pancreatic fistula, delayed gastric emptying, hemorrhage, bile leakage, reoperation, and mortality, were of no significant differences. Pathologically, lymph node number was similar (P=0.11); meanwhile, margin R0 ratio was higher in minimally invasive approach group (P=0.03). Subgroup analysis manifested robotic surgery spent comparable surgical time (P=0.16) as laparotomy, with earlier discharge (P=0.04). Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy may be associated with shorter hospital stay, less estimated blood loss, and positive margin rate without compromising surgical safety as open surgery. Surgical duration of robotic method could even be equivalent as laparotomy. Minimally invasive approach can be a reasonable alternative to laparotomy pancreaticoduodenectomy with potential advantages. Nevertheless, future large-volume, well-designed RCTs with extensive follow-up are awaited to confirm and update the findings of this analysis. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams amp; Wilkins."

Rapid antigen diagnostic tests (RADTs) are a promising alternative, although concerns about their sensitivity and specificity, and variation between test methodologies, have limited their clinical use. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of RADTs for GAS pharyngitis. METHODS: Medline and Embase from 1996 to 2013 were used as data sources. Of 159 identified studies, 48 studies of diagnostic accuracy of GAS RADTs using throat culture on blood agar as a reference standard were selected. Bivariate random-effects regression was used to estimate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Additional meta-analyses were performed for pediatric data. RESULTS: A total of 60 pairs of sensitivity and specificity from 48 studies were included. Overall summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity of RADTs were 0.86 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.88) and 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.97), respectively, and estimates for pediatric data were similar. Molecular-based RADTs had the best diagnostic accuracy. Considerable variability exists in methodology between studies. There were insufficient studies to allow meta-regression/subgroup analysis within each test type. CONCLUSIONS: RADTs can be used for accurate diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis to streamline management of sore throat in primary care. RADTs may not require culture backup for negative tests in most low-incidence rheumatic fever settings. Newer molecular tests have the highest sensitivity, but are not true point-of-care tests. ? 2014 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."

As a consequence, primary mesh augmentation (PMA), a technique to strengthen the abdominal wall, has been gaining popularity. This meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the prophylactic effect of PMA on the incidence of IH compared to primary suture (PS). Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PMA and PS for closing the abdominal wall after surgery were included. Results: Out of 576 papers, 5 RCTs were selected comprising 346 patients. IH occurred significantly less in the PMA group (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12-0.52, I20%; p &lt; 0.001). No difference could be observed with regard to wound infection (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.39-1.91, I2 0%; p = 0.71) or seroma (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64-2.33, I2 0%; p = 0.55).

We searched PubMed for RCTs comparing a FDC with the same active drugs administered as separate pills, including a quantitative estimate of treatment adherence, without restriction to medical condition. The odds ratio (OR) of optimal adherence with FDCs versus separate pills was used as common effect size and aggregated into a pooled effect estimate using a random effect model with inverse variance weights. Out of 1258 articles screened, only six studies fulfilled inclusion criteria. Across medical conditions, administering drugs as FDC significantly increased the likelihood of optimal adherence (OR 1.33 (95% CI, 1.03-1.71)). Within subgroups of specific medical conditions, the favourable effect of FDCs on adherence was of borderline statistical significance for HIV infection only (OR 1.46 (95% CI, 1.00-2.13)).

DATA SOURCES Trials published prior to December, 31, 2013, were identified searching Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, and relevant review articles. STUDY SELECTION Randomized placebo-controlled trials assessing the efficacy and adverse effects of pharmacologic anti-inflammatory treatment in adults with depressive symptoms, including those who fulfilled the criteria for depression. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Datawere extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Depression scores after treatment and adverse effects. RESULTS Ten publications reporting on 14 trials (6262 participants)were included: 10 trials evaluated the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (n = 4258) and 4 investigated cytokine inhibitors (n = 2004). The pooled effect estimate suggested that anti-inflammatory treatment reduced depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.34; 95%CI, -0.57 to -0.11; I2 = 90%) compared with placebo. This effectwas observed in studies including patients with depression (SMD, -0.54; 95%CI, -1.08 to -0.01; I2 = 68%) and depressive symptoms (SMD, -0.27; 95%CI, -0.53 to -0.01; I2 = 68%). The heterogeneity of the studieswas not explained by differences in inclusion of clinical depression vs depressive symptoms or use of NSAIDs vs cytokine inhibitors. Subanalyses emphasized the antidepressant properties of the selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor celecoxib (SMD, -0.29; 95%CI, -0.49 to -0.08; I2 = 73%) on remission (OR, 7.89; 95%CI, 2.94 to 21.17; I2 = 0%) and response (OR, 6.59; 95%CI, 2.24 to 19.42; I2 = 0%). Among the 6 studies reporting on adverse effects,we found no evidence of an increased number of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular events after 6weeks or infections after 12weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment compared with placebo. All trialswere associated with a high risk of bias owing to potentially compromised internal validity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our analysis suggests that anti-inflammatory treatment, in particular celecoxib, decreases depressive symptoms without increased risks of adverse effects. However, a high risk of bias and high heterogeneity made the mean estimate uncertain. This study supports a proof-of-concept concerning the use of anti-inflammatory treatment in depression.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane database for studies of stem cell therapy in patients with stroke from its inception through July 2014. The articles included in the search were restricted to the English language, studies with at least 5 patients, and those using cell-based therapies for treating stroke. Results: Fourteen studies included in the meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores from baseline to follow-up points was 5.7 points (95%CI: -8.2 to -3.2, I2=91.5%) decreased. Also the pooled mean difference in modified Bathel index (BI) score was increased by 31.5 points (95%CI: 35.6~14.9, I2=52.7%) and the pooled incidence rate to achieve on modified Rankin score (mRS)?2 was 40% (95% CI: 30%~51%, I2=35.4%) at follow-up points.

Search terms included ""open abdomen,"" ""abdominal compartment syndrome,"" ""laparostomy,"" ""celiotomy,"" ""abdominal closure,"" ""primary,"" ""delayed,"" ""permanent,"" ""fascial closure,"" and ""definitive closure."" Open abdomen was defined as ""fail to close abdominal fascia after a laparotomy."" Mortality, complications, and length of stay were compared between early and delayed fascial closure. In total, 3125 patients were included for final analysis, and 1942 (62%) patients successfully achieved early fascial closure. Vacuum assisted fascial closure had no impact on pooled fascial closure rate. Compared with delayed abdominal closure, early fascial closure significantly reduced mortality (12.3% versus 24.8%, RR, 0.53, P < 0.0001) and complication incidence (RR, 0.68, P < 0.0001). The mean interval from open abdomen to definitive closure ranged from 2.2 to 14.6 days in early fascial closure groups, but from 32.5 to 300 days in delayed closure groups. This study confirmed clinical advantages of early fascial closure over delayed approach in treatment of patients with open abdomen. ? 2014 Yu Chen et al."

While multiple trials have described the efficacy of individual PCV2 vaccines relative to non-vaccination, few studies provide product-to-product comparisons of efficacy. Given the well-documented efficacy of PCV2 vaccines, information about the comparative efficacy of available vaccines is more relevant to producers and veterinarians than comparison to non-vaccination. The objective of this study was to provide comparative estimates of changes in average daily gain effect associated with the use of the commercially available PCV2 vaccines. PubMed, CAB Abstracts, AGRICOLA, the USA Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics database of licenses and provisions, and the proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, the Allen D.

Methods: Based on the principles and methods of Cochrane systematic, we searched the Cochrane Library, Pubmed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and CBM from the date of establishment of the databases to November 2013. The bibliographies of the included studies were searched, too. Two reviewers screened the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted the data, assessed the quality and conducted meta-analysis with Revman 5.1 software. Results: A total of 9RCTs were included. Compared with metformin monotherapy, SGLT2 inhibitors plus metformin was associated with more reduction in HbA1c level (MD=-0.51, 95%CI [-0.61, -0.41], P<0.00001), more reduction in FPG level (MD=-1.21, 95%CI [-1.46, -0.95], P<0.000 01), more weight loss (MD=-2.07, 95%CI [-2.40, -1.73], P<0.000 01), more reduction in systolic pressure level (MD=-2.89, 95%CI [-4.33, -1.45], P<0.000 01), more reduction in diastolic pressure level (MD=-1.61, 95%CI [-2.55, -0.67], P=0.000 8), and higher risk of reproductive tract infection (%) (RR=2.34, 95%CI [1.45, 3.78], P=0.0005), but was not associated with the higher risk of the incident hypoglycaemic episodes (RR=0.96, 95%CI[10.58, 1.60], P=0.89), and nor the higher risk of incident UTI(%) (RR=1.37, 95%CI [0.97, 1.95], P=0.08), nor the higher risk of most common adverse events (RR=1.12, 95%CI [10.99, 1.26], P=0.07), and nor the higher risk of at least one serious adverse event (RR=1.09, 95% CI [10.73, 1.62], P=0.69).

Hypothesis Compared with surgical closure, the clinical effect of catheterization therapy in pediatric PDA patients requires meta-analysis. Methods A systematic literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, and the Chinese Biomedicine literature database was conducted. Eligible studies included controlled trials of pediatric PDA patients receiving catheterization therapy vs surgical closure. Relative risks (RRs), standard mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 test. Results Seven studies with a total of 810 patients met the inclusion criteria. Catheterization therapy neither significantly increased the primary success rate (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-1.03, P = 0.16) nor reduced the total postprocedure complications (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.44-1.25, P = 0.26) and blood transfusion (RR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.16-7.67, P = 0.93).

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions for active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed with the following inclusion criteria: adult HIV patients treated with ART, an intervention to enhance patient adherence, adherence rate as an outcome, a clinical or patient outcome, a randomised controlled trial and conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies were selected by two reviewers independently. Data on patient characteristics, interventions, adherence definition and measures, and results were extracted. The risk of bias was evaluated by two reviewers independently. A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. All discrepancies were discussed until consensus. Results: Six trials fulfilled all inclusion criteria. One showed statistically significant results in favour of the intervention for adherence rate and clinical outcome. The other studies showed either no significant results for any outcome or heterogeneous results depending on the outcome type. Aside from the clinical outcomes in one study, all outcomes showed a tendency in favour of the intervention groups. In the meta-analysis short message service (SMS) interventions showed a statistically significant effect on adherence (risk difference?-0.10; 95% confidence interval (CI):-0.17 to-0.03) and modified directly observed therapy (DOT) showed a significant effect on mortality (relative risk?0.75; 95% CI: 0.44-1.26). Conclusion: The adherence-enhancing interventions (DOT, SMS interventions, counselling plus an alarm device) increased adherence only slightly, possibly because the high baseline adherence causes a ceiling effect. ? 2014 CSIRO."

Methods Systematic literature searches were made to identify articles on colorectal resection for benign or malignant disease published until April 2013. The primary outcome was the rate of anastomotic leak. Secondary outcomes were intraoperative variables, postoperative adverse event rates, and early and late oncological outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs), weighted mean differences (WMDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes were calculated using meta-analytical techniques. Results The final analysis included 19 non-randomized, observational studies of 14 344 colorectal resections, of which 8845 (61¡P7 per cent) were performed by experts and 5499 (38¡P3 per cent) by trainees. The overall rate of anastomotic leak was 2¡P6 per cent. Compared with experts, trainees had a lower leak rate (3¡P0 versus 2¡P0 per cent; OR 0¡P72, P = 0¡P010), but there was no difference between experts and expert-supervised trainees (3¡P2 versus 2¡P5 per cent; OR 0¡P77, P = 0¡P080).

While publications describing FMT as therapy for IBD have more than doubled since 2012, research that investigates FMT treatment efficacy has been scarce. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of FMT as treatment for patients with IBD. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed through May 2014. Inclusion criteria required FMT as the primary therapeutic agent. Clinical remission (CR) and/or mucosal healing were defined as primary outcomes. Studies were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes or included patients with infections. Results: Eighteen studies (9 cohort studies, 8 case studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) were included. 122 patients were described (79 ulcerative colitis (UC); 39 Crohn's disease (CD); 4 IBD unclassified). Overall, 45% (54/119) of patients achieved CR during follow-up. Among the cohort studies, the pooled proportion of patients that achieved CR was 36.2% (95% CI 17.4%-60.4%), with a moderate risk of heterogeneity (Cochran's Q, P=0.011; I2=37%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated a pooled estimate of clinical remission of 22% (95% CI 10.4%-40.8%) for UC (P=0.37; I2=0%) and 60.5% (95% CI 28.4%-85.6%) for CD (P=0.05; I2=37%). Six studies performed microbiota analysis. Conclusions: This analysis suggests that FMT is a safe, but variably efficacious treatment for IBD. More randomized controlled trials are needed and should investigate frequency of FMT administration, donor selection and standardization of microbiome analysis. ? 2014 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation."

Related studies were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and complementary manual searches up to December 30, 2013. We used standard methods recommended for meta-analyses of diagnostic test evaluations. The analysis was based on a summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve. Meta-regression analysis was used to assess the effects of some confounding factors on the results of the meta-analysis. The potential presence of publication bias was tested using the Deeks¡¦ funnel plots. The pooled estimates of IL-2 for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosis were as follows: sensitivity, 0.81 [95?% confidence interval (CI), 0.60 to 0.92]; specificity, 0.95 (95?% CI, 0.90 to 0.97); positive likelihood ratio (PLR), 15.2 (95?% CI, 8.1to 28.4); negative likelihood ratio (NLR), 0.20 (95?% CI, 0.09 to 0.47). We found that the SROC curve is positioned near the upper left corner of the curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.96 (95?% CI, 0.94 to 0.98).

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in critically ill adult patients that evaluated FO-containing emulsions, either in the context of parenteral nutrition (PN) or enteral nutrition (EN). Results: A total of 6 RCTs (n = 390 patients) were included; the mean methodological score of all trials was 10 (range, 6-13). When the results of these studies were aggregated, FO-containing emulsions were associated with a trend toward a reduction in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.04; P =.08; heterogeneity I2 = 0%) and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation (weighted mean difference in days [WMD], -1.41; 95% CI, -3.43 to 0.61; P =.17). However, this strategy had no effect on infections (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.42-1.36; P =.35) and intensive care unit length of stay (WMD, -0.46; 95% CI, -4.87 to 3.95; P =.84, heterogeneity I2 = 75%). Conclusion: FO-containing lipid emulsions may be able to decrease mortality and ventilation days in the critically ill. However, because of the paucity of clinical data, there is inadequate evidence to recommend the routine use of parenteral FO. Large, rigorously designed RCTs are required to elucidate the efficacy of parenteral FO in the critically ill. ? 2013 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition."

Methods: Online databases were searched for English-language articles published between 1991 and April 2011 describing posterior atlantoaxial instrumentation with C1-2 SRC. There were 24 studies including 1073 patients treated with SRC that fulfilled inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis techniques were used to compare outcomes. Results: All studies provided class III evidence. The 30-day perioperative mortality rate was 0.6%, and neurologic injury occurred in two patients with vertebral artery injury (VAI) from screw malpositions (0.2%). The incidence of clinically significant screw malpositions was 2.4% (confidence interval [CI], 1.1%-4.1%), the incidence of VAI was 2.0% (CI, 1.1%-3.4%), and the rate of fusion with the SRC technique was 97.5% (CI, 95.9%-98.5%). Conclusions: SRC is a safe and effective treatment option for C1-2 instability.

Avoiding the potentially devastating sequelae of an undetected bile leakage is the main rationale behind this practice. Aim of this meta-analysis was to compare evidence on routine drain placement after laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus no drainage. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was conducted; outcome variables included postoperative pain, subhepatic collection, 30-day morbidity, wound-related complications, and drainage interventions. The fixed- and random effects models were used in order to calculate combined overall effect sizes of pooled data. Data are presented as the odds ratio (OR) or difference in means with 95% confidence interval (CI). Six randomized trials including 1167 patients were identified. Pain scores were significantly higher in the drainage group both at 6-12h (mean difference 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.24, P<0.0001) and at 12-24h after surgery (mean difference 1.12,95% CI 0.86-1.39, P<0.0001). No difference was found with regard to the incidence of subhepatic collection and drainage procedures. A trend in favor of the no drain approach with regard to 30-day morbidity and wound infection was registered, although this was less pronounced after sensitivity analysis. The possible clinical benefit of routine use of abdominal drainage in uncomplicated laparoscopic cholecystectomies requires larger study populations. The approach is however not encouraged on the basis of the present analysis, as it results in increased postoperative pain and overall morbidity."

This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of extended lymphadenectomy in patients with gastric cancer. Methods A comprehensive search was performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the outcomes of D1 and D2 dissection for gastric cancer in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, Web of Science and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database in any language from inception of the database to March 2012. Meta-analyses were performed using Review Manager software. Results Eight RCTs including a total of 2044 patients (D1, 1042; D2, 1002) were eligible for meta-analysis. Five-year survival and haemorrhage rates were similar in the two groups. There were significant differences in morbidity, anastomotic leakage, pancreatic leakage, reoperation rates, wound infection, pulmonary complications and postoperative mortality, all of which favoured D1 dissection. Subgroup analysis indicated a trend towards lower gastric cancer-related mortality in patients undergoing D2 dissection who did not also have resection of the spleen or pancreas. Conclusion D2 dissection was associated with a significantly higher postoperative risk. A trend towards lower gastric cancer-related mortality was found following D2 dissection that did not include resection of the spleen or pancreas, but further long-term survival data are needed to determine whether there is a specific survival benefit after D2 dissection.

It is unclear whether the internet facilitates pursuit of high-risk sex or whether MSM seeking sex online are a higher-risk population than other MSM. To summarise evidence as to whether internet-based partner selection predisposes MSM to high-risk behaviour, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies comparing MSM's UAI risk in online-initiated encounters to their UAI risk in offline-initiated encounters. Methods: We systematically searched published, peer-reviewed literature to identify studies reporting MSM participants' engagement in UAI with online-identified and offline-identified male partners. We calculated pooled odds ratios for any UAI and for seroadaptive UAI practices with partners identified online relative to partners identified offline. Results: We included 11 studies representing 39 602 sexual encounters. Odds for any UAI, seroconcordant UAI and serodiscordant UAI with strategic positioning were higher in online-initiated than offline-initiated encounters. Odds for UAI in group sex were higher in online-initiated encounters only among HIV-positive MSM. Effect sizes for all outcomes were greater among HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM. Effect sizes were greatest when bathhouses, saunas and sex resorts were treated as offline comparison venues. Conclusions: Encounters initiated online have elevated odds for entailing UAI and seroadaptive UAI practices. Online-delivered behavioural interventions should address insufficiency of risk-reducing practices involving UAI relative to consistent condom use and promote frequent HIV testing among MSM seeking UAI partners online."

Methods: We performed a systematic review using meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). Eligible trials were randomised clinical trials comparing proton pump inhibitors or histamine 2 receptor antagonists with either placebo or no prophylaxis. Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. The Cochrane Collaboration methodology was used. Risk ratios/relative risks (RR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. The predefined outcome measures were all-cause mortality, GI bleeding, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Results: Twenty trials (n = 1,971) were included; all were judged as having a high risk of bias. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality (fixed effect: RR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.84-1.20; P = 0.87; I 2 = 0 %) or hospital-acquired pneumonia (random effects: RR 1.23, 95 % CI 0.86-1.78; P = 0.28; I 2 = 19 %) between SUP patients and the no prophylaxis/placebo patients.

A 1- or 2-dose schedule, potentially administered intradermally with reduced antigen content, may make this affordable.Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies documenting seroconversion after 1 or 2, full or fractional (1/5) doses of enhanced-potency IPV was performed. Studies reporting the clinical efficacy of IPV were also reviewed.Results: Twenty study arms from 12 published articles were included in the analysis of seroconversion. One full dose of intramuscular IPV seroconverted 33%, 41%, and 47% of infants against serotypes 1, 2, and 3 on average, whereas 2 full doses seroconverted 79%, 80%, and 90%, respectively. Seroconversion increased with age at administration. Limited data from case-control studies indicate clinical efficacy equivalent to the proportion seroconverting. One fractional dose of intradermal IPV gave lower seroconversion (10%-40%), but after 2 doses seroconversion was comparable to that with full-dose IPV.Conclusions: Routine immunization with 2 full or fractional doses of IPV given after 10 weeks of age is likely to protect >80% of recipients against poliomyelitis if poliovirus reemerges after withdrawal of OPV serotypes. ?

Participants were cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Trial designs included comparisons of CHM with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, supportive treatments for leucopenia, and/or placebo. Main outcomes were white blood cell count and incidence of leucopenia. Screening, data extraction, and analysis were conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines.Results: Eighty-three RCTs (n = 8,012) met the inclusion criteria. Fifteen Chinese patent medicines and 47 different modified formulas were used as prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced leucopenia. Compared with no treatment, CHMs were shown to decrease the incidence of leucopenia (odds ratio (OR) ?0.23 [?0.20, ?0.27]), P < 0.00001), with the number needed to treat (NNT) ?3.45 [?3.13, ?3.85].

However, perioperative anemia is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiovascular surgery. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine whether perioperative restrictive transfusion thresholds are associated with inferior clinical outcomes in randomized trials of cardiovascular surgery patients. Data Sources: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to October 2013; reference lists of published guidelines, reviews, and associated articles, as well as conference proceedings. No language restrictions were applied. Study Selection: We included controlled trials in which adult patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery were randomized to different transfusion thresholds, described as a hemoglobin or hematocrit level below which RBCs were transfused. Data Extraction: Two authors independently extracted data from included trials. We pooled risk ratios of dichotomous outcomes and mean differences of continuous outcomes across trials using random-effects models. Data Synthesis: Seven studies (enrolling 1,262 participants) met inclusion criteria with restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds most commonly differing by a hemoglobin of 1 g/dL or hematocrit of 6-7%, resulting in decreased transfusions by 0.71 units of RBCs (95% CI, 0.31-1.09, p = 0.0002) without an associated change in adverse events: mortality (risk ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65-1.95; p = 0.60), myocardial infarction (risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.30-2.99; p = 0.92), stroke (risk ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.57-2.32; p = 0.70), acute renal failure (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.64-1.49; p = 0.91), infections (risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85-1.78; p = 0.27), or length of stay. There was no betweentrial heterogeneity for any pooled analysis. Including four pediatric trials (456 participants) and 10 trials utilizing only intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution (872 participants) did not substantially change the results except that unlike the transfusion threshold trials, the hemodilution trials did not reduce the proportion of patients transfused (interaction p = 0.01).

We searched Medline, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.org, Popline, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar search engines, along with reference lists from all included studies. The RevMan 5.0 software was used for all analyses. Primary maternal outcomes were defined as death, ICU admission and need for transfusion, while primary neonatal outcomes were defined as death, neonatal unit admission and 5 min Apgar score less than 7. Ten studies were finally retrieved involving 23,104 singleton childbearing women (18,160 operated in the first stage and 4944 in the second stage of labor). Second stage cesarean section seems to lead to higher maternal admissions to ICU (OR 7.41, 95% CI 2.47-22.5) and higher transfusion rates (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.49-2.54). Neonatal death rates were also increased (OR 5.20, 95% CI 2.49-10.85) along with admissions to neonatal unit (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.91-2.91) and rates of Apgar score less than 7 in 5 min (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.02-7.50). Second stage cesarean section seems to result significantly increased morbidity for both mothers and neonates. It seems that a direct evaluation with forceps and vacuum extractors is imperative in order to establish its place in modern evidence-based practice. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This heterogeneity may be of clinical, methodological or statistical origin. The last of these is quantified by the I2-statistic. We investigated, using simulated studies, the accuracy of I2 in the assessment of heterogeneity and the effects of heterogeneity on the predictive value of meta-analyses. The relevance of quantifying I2 was determined according to the likely presence of heterogeneity between studies (low, high, or unknown) and the calculated I2 (low or high). The findings were illustrated by published meta-analyses of selective digestive decontamination and weaning protocols. As expected, I2 increases and the likelihood of drawing correct inferences from a meta-analysis decreases with increasing heterogeneity. With low levels of heterogeneity, I2 does not appear to be predictive of the accuracy of the meta-analysis result. With high levels of heterogeneity, even meta-analyses with low I2-values have low predictive values. Most commonly, the level of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis will be unknown. In these scenarios, I2 determination may help to identify estimates with low predictive values (high I2). In this situation, the results of a meta-analysis will be unreliable. With low I2-values and unknown levels of heterogeneity, predictive values of pooled estimates may range extensively, and findings should be interpreted with caution. In conclusion, quantifying statistical heterogeneity through I2-statistics is only helpful when the amount of clinical heterogeneity is unknown and I2 is high. Objective methods to quantify the levels of clinical and methodological heterogeneity are urgently needed to allow reliable determination of the accuracy of meta-analyses. ? 2013 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases."

However, there is increasing evidence from a number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) suggesting no benefit from the use of drains. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was carried out, and RCTs comparing the use of drains versus no drains in patients who underwent thyroid or parathyroid surgery were included. Trials including patients who underwent lateral neck dissection were excluded. Methodological quality was graded and data were extracted by independent reviewers. Risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) was calculated and heterogeneity was assessed. Results Twenty-five RCTs were included in the meta-analysis comprising 2939 patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in rate of reoperation for neck haematoma (RR 1¡P90, 95 per cent c.i. 0¡P87 to 4¡P14), ultrasound-assessed fluid volume on day 1 after surgery (MD 2¡P30 (95 per cent c.i. -0¡P73 to 5¡P34) ml), wound collection requiring intervention (RR 0¡P64, 0¡P38 to 1¡P09) or not (RR 0¡P93, 0¡P66 to 1¡P30), transient voice change (RR 2¡P33, 0¡P91 to 5¡P96) and persistent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RR 1¡P67, 0¡P22 to 12¡P51).

The aim of this study was to review systematically the effect of bevacizumab compared to ranibizumab in patients with AMD at 1?year. Methods: A systematic review was performed on Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library and Trial registers to October 2013. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing bevacizumab with ranibizumab in patients with neovascular AMD. Odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) estimates were synthesized under fixed- and random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I2. Results: Five RCTs were included, representing 2,686 randomised patients. The meta-analysis confirmed the non-inferiority of bevacizumab compared to ranibizumab for change in visual acuity at 1?year (MD 0.57 letters, ?1.80 to 0.66, p = 0.37, I2 = 0?%). Better anatomical results were found for ranibizumab. Bevacizumab was associated with a 34?% increase in the number of patients with at least one serious systemic adverse event (OR 1.34, 1.08 to 1.66, p = 0.01, I2 = 0?%). Conclusions: The pooled evidence confirmed that, compared with ranibizumab, bevacizumab was associated with equivalent effects on visual acuity at 1?year and with a higher risk of systemic serious adverse events. The current available data do not show which types of adverse events occur more frequently. In practice, bevacizumab should be used under a risk-management plan until further studies have been carried out to assess accurately the increased risk of systemic adverse events. ? 2014, The Author(s)."

Poor nutrition, poverty, household crowding, drug resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains, AIDS, and malfunctioning TB control programs are important risk factors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature reporting case-fatalities of TBM among adults in African countries from 1970 till date. A PubMed search identified relevant papers. Employed terms include 'adult tuberculous meningitis' AND 'tuberculosis Africa'. PRISMA review guidelines were applied. Adult TBM case-fatalities, odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), forest-plot meta-analysis for weighted OR and RR, funnel plots, L'Abb? plots, meta-regressed bubble plots, and inter-study homogeneity were computed. Among 15 studies included, adult TBM occurred in up to 28 % of all meningitis forms with case-fatality of 60 % (inverse-variance weighted 54 %). Fixed-effect meta-analysis revealed weighted OR and RR of adult TBM fatalities to be 4.37 (95 % CI 3.92, 4.88) and 2.53 (95 % CI 2.38, 2.69), respectively. Inter-study homogeneity was reliable, regional representativeness was adequate allowing generalizability, and funnel-plots behaved symmetrically with insignificant inconsistency. All cases were initiated with anti-TB medication, while some had 'breakthrough' TBM. In Africa, adult TBM has a significant public health importance with a very high fatality which has remained stagnant for the past half-century. This reflects ongoing low quality of medical care at facilities where lengthy referrals end up. Community-based studies can reveal higher unaccounted morbidity, accrued disability, and larger mortality. Improving access points for early TB management at community-level, developing health infra-structure for comprehensive case management at facility-level, and poverty reduction can help combat this multi-faceted problem - whose reduction can in return help fight poverty. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag."
1901,"Wilson A.L., Chen-Hussey V., Logan J.G., Lindsay S.W.",Are topical insect repellents effective against malaria in endemic populations? A systematic review and meta-Analysis,2014,Malaria Journal,10.1186/1475-2875-13-446,25413142,"Background: Recommended vector control tools against malaria, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), mainly target mosquitoes that rest and feed on human hosts indoors. However, in some malaria-endemic areas, such as Southeast Asia and South America, malaria vectors primarily bite outdoors meaning that LLINs and IRS may be less effective. In these situations the use of topical insect repellents may reduce outdoor biting and morbidity from malaria. A systematic review and meta-Analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of topical insect repellents against malaria. Methods: Studies were identified using database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and clinical trials registers), as well as reference list searches and contact with researchers. Randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included that assessed the effect of topical repellents (all active ingredients and concentrations) on Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax malaria or infection in malaria-endemic populations. Meta-Analysis of clinical data was conducted in order to generate summary risk ratios. Results: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. Studies varied in terms of repellent active ingredient and formulation, co-interventions, study population, compliance, and follow-up period. Topical repellents showed an 18% protective efficacy against P. falciparum malaria, although this was not significant (95% CI:-8%, 38%). Similarly, the average protective efficacy of topical repellents against P. vivax malaria did not reach significance (protective efficacy: 20%, 95% CI:-37%, 53%). Exclusion of non-randomized trials from the meta-Analysis did not alter the findings. Conclusions: Although topical repellents can provide individual protection against mosquitoes, the results of this meta-Analysis indicate that topical repellents are unlikely to provide effective protection against malaria. However, there was substantial heterogeneity between studies included and the relatively small number of studies meant that this heterogeneity could not be fully explored in the analysis. Further well-designed trials of topical repellents at appropriate doses and alternative modes of repellent delivery, such as spatial repellents and long-lasting insecticide-Treated clothing, are required."

Methods: Studies published through May 2013 were identified from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane library, ScienceDirect, and other databases. Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of methodology using the Grade of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach and extracted data from literature. The mean difference (MD) of blood loss, hemoglobin loss, and risk ratios (RR) of transfusion rate and adverse events in the fibrin-treated and placebo groups were pooled throughout the study. The relevant data were analyzed using Stata 11.0 software. Results: Eight studies were included in the review, with a total sample size of 558 patients. The drainage blood loss [MD=-354.02mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-500.87 to-207.18); P<0.05], reduction in calculated total blood loss [MD=-402.12, 95% CI (-599.16 to-205.08); P<0.05], hemoglobin loss [MD=-0.86g/dL, 95% CI (-1.10g/dL to-0.61g/dL); P<0.05], and transfusion rate [RR=0.62, 95% CI (0.45-0.86); P<0.05] were all significantly reduced following treatment with fibrin sealants. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events [RR=0.69, 95% CI (0.32-1.59); P>0.05] among the study groups. Conclusions: The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that fibrin sealants for patients undergoing TKA may reduce blood loss and maintain higher hemoglobin levels, particularly when fibrin sealants are used at higher dosage. Furthermore, fibrin sealants do not increase the risk of postoperative deep vein thrombosis, superficial infection, pulmonary embolism, and hematoma. Further evaluation is required to confirm our findings before fibrin sealants can be used in patients undergoing TKA. Level of evidence: II. ? 2013 Surgical Associates Ltd."

Objective: In light of the safety concerns, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies of TLR9 agonists. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted. We selected studies in which the subjects were treated with a TLR9 agonist and in which the safety of the TLR9 agonist was monitored. We extracted data on adverse events (AEs) when available. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the commonest and clinical significant AEs observed in the controlled studies. Results: Nine single-arm studies and 12 controlled studies met our selection criteria. Subjects treated with TLR9 agonists were at a higher risk of anemia (risk ratio [RR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.06), neutropenia (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.21), leukopenia (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.22), lymphopenia (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10-1.25), thrombocytopenia (RR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.27), flu-like symptoms (RR 10.59, 95% CI: 3.66-30.66), diarrhea (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18-1.67) and headache (RR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.26-2.06). Injection-site reactions, such as erythema, pain, pruritus and swelling, were mild to moderate. TLR9 agonist therapies have not been associated with clinically significant autoimmune diseases, and few deaths potentially attributable to TLR9 agonists have been reported. Conclusion: The toxicity of TLR9 agonists is generally acceptable, except when the agonist is combined with immunosuppressive agents in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies between ACDF with plate fixation and ACCF with plate fixation for the treatment of MCSM. An extensive search of literature was performed in PubMed, Mediline, Embase and the Cochrane library. The following outcome measures were extracted: JOA scores, fusion rate, cervical lordosis (C2¡V7), complications, blood loss and operation time. Data analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.0. Results: Four cohorts (six studies) involving 258 patients were included in this study. The pooled analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the postoperative JOA score [WMD?=??0.14 (?1.37, 1.10), P?=?0.83], fusion rate [OR?=?0.84 (0.15, 4.86), P?=?0.85] between two group.

Conclusions: As compared with ACCF with plate fixation, ACDF with plate fixation showed no significant differences in terms of postoperative JOA score, fusion rate, but better improved cervical lordosis, lower complication and smaller surgical trauma. As the limitations of small sample and short follow-up in this study, it still could not be identified whether ACDF with plate fixation is more effective and safer than ACCF with plate fixation. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

With the advent of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), flexible endoscopy has aimed at en bloc R0 resection of superficial lesions of the digestive tract. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the safety and effectiveness of ESD and full-thickness rectal wall excision by TEM in the treatment of large nonpedunculated rectal lesions preoperatively assessed as noninvasive. Methods: A systematic review of the literature published between 1984 and 2010 was conducted (Registration no. CRD42012001882). Data were integrated with those from the original databases requested from the study authors when needed. Pooled estimates of the proportions of patients with en bloc R0 resection, complications, recurrence, and need for further treatment in the ESD and TEM series were compared using random-effects single-arm meta-analysis. Results: This review included 11 ESD and 10 TEM series (2,077 patients). The en bloc resection rate was 87.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 84.3-90.6) for the ESD patients versus 98.7% (95% CI 97.4-99.3%) for the TEM patients (P < 0.001). The R0 resection rate was 74.6% (95% CI 70.4-78.4%) for the ESD patients versus 88.5% (95% CI 85.9-90.6%) for the TEM patients (P < 0.001). The postoperative complications rate was 8.0% (95%, CI 5.4-11.8%) for the ESD patients versus 8.4% (95% CI 5.2-13.4%) for the TEM patients (P = 0.874). The recurrence rate was 2.6% (95% CI 1.3-5.2%) for the ESD patients versus 5.2% (95% CI 4.0-6.9%) for the TEM patients (P<0.001). Nevertheless, the rate for the overall need of further abdominal treatment, defined as any type of surgery performed through an abdominal access, including both complications and pathology indications, was 8.4% (95% CI 4.9-13.9%) for the ESD patients versus 1.8% (95% CI 0.8-3.7%) for the TEM patients (P<0.001). Conclusions: The ESD procedure appears to be a safe technique, but TEM achieves a higher R0 resection rate when performed in full-thickness fashion, significantly reducing the need for further abdominal treatment. ?

The rates of successful procedure and complication were extracted and analyzed. We charted the overall success rate on a forest plot with 95% confidence intervals. Data of success rates were analyzed in 5- and 10-year intervals to determine whether the rate of success had increased chronologically. We then performed 3 subgroup analyses according to instrument type (needles vs knife blades), cortisone use (cortisone vs noncortisone), and sonography guidance (sonography vs non-sonography guidance). Pooled success rates were calculated in the subgroups and compared using chi-square test.Results A total of 34 studies involving 2,114 percutaneous procedures were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The total success rate was 94%. There was a trend toward increasing number of publications in the past 20 years. We found a statistically significant trend showing that overall success rates had increased over time. Chi-square test revealed that percutaneous release with sonography guidance had a significantly higher success rate than non-sonography guidance. There were no significant differences in other subgroup analyses including instrument type and cortisone use.Conclusions Percutaneous release is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of trigger digit.

Despite reports of efficacy against all grades of CIN (CIN1-3), cold coagulation has been infrequently used since the 1980s, and was absent from the recent Cochrane review on CIN treatment. Objectives To provide a systematic review of cold coagulation efficacy and acceptability for CIN treatment through meta-analysis of clinical reports and a randomised control trial. Search strategy A literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and regional databases yielded 388 papers. Title, abstract and/or reference list review identified 22 papers describing cold coagulation treatment of CIN, with 13 providing adequate data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Selection criteria Publications or conference abstracts describing original data (number of women treated, followed up and cured, provider type, cure definition) were retained. No language or publication date limitations were imposed. Data collection and analysis Data extracted from 13 studies were pooled, and statistical analyses of proportion cured were conducted with data stratified by lesion grade and study region. Main results Among 4569 CIN patients treated with cold coagulation, summary proportion cured of 96% [95% confidence interval (CI) 92-99%] and 95% (92-98%) were obtained for CIN1 and CIN2-3 disease, respectively. Side-effects and adverse effects were infrequent, and fertility was not impaired. Conclusions Cold coagulation CIN cure rates were comparable to those of other excisional and ablative methods. Cold coagulation is indicated for all grades of CIN, is safe, quick and acceptable, and may be of particular relevance for use in resource-limited settings. ? 2014 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists."

Several sub-analysis were performed: stratification by background (low income vs. high income countries); including only microbiological confirmed TB cases; including only studies performing a simultaneous three-way comparison of the three tests, and including immunocompromised children. Results: Overall, 31 studies (6183 children) for QFT-G-IT, 14 studies (2518 children) for T-SPOT.TB and 34 studies (6439 children) for TST were included in the analyses. In high income countries QFT-G-IT sensitivity was 0.79 (95% IC: 0.75-0.82) considering all the studies, 0.78 (95%CI:0.70-0.84) including only studies performing a simultaneous three-way comparison and 0.86 (95%IC 0.81-0.90) considering only microbiologically confirmed studies. In the same analyses T-SPOT.TB sensitivity was 0.67 (95%IC 0.62-0.73); 0.76 (95%CI: 0.68 to 0.83); and 0.79 (95%IC 0.69-0.87), respectively. In low income countries QFT-G-IT pooled sensitivity was significantly lower: 0.57 (95%IC:0.52-0.61), considering all the studies, and 0.66 (95%IC 0.55-0.76) considering only microbiologically confirmed cases; while T-SPOT.TB sensitivity was 0.61 (95%IC 0.57-0.65) overall, but reached 0.80 (95%IC 0.73-0.86) in microbiologically confirmed cases. In microbiologically confirmed cases TST sensitivity was similar: 0.86 (95%IC 0.79-0.91) in high income countries, and 0.74 (95%IC 0.68-0.80) in low income countries. Higher IGRAs specificity with respect to TST was observed in high income countries (97-98% vs. 92%) but not in low income countries (85-93% vs. 90%). Conclusions: Both IGRAs showed no better performance than TST in low income countries. ? 2014 Sollai et al."

However, the association between anastomotic type and surgical outcome is controversial. Aims: The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare surgical outcomes between stapled side-to-side anastomosis (SSSA) and handsewn end-to-end anastomosis (HEEA) after ileocolic resection in patients with CD. Methods: Studies comparing SSSA with HEEA after ileocolic resection in patients with CD were identified in PubMed and EMBASE. Outcomes such as complication, recurrence, and re-operation were evaluated. Eight studies (three randomized controlled trials, one prospective non-randomized trial, and four non-randomized retrospective trials) comparing SSSA (396 cases) and HEEA (425 cases) were included. Results: As compared with HEEA, SSSA was superior in terms of overall postoperative complications [odds ratio (OR), 0.54; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.93], anastomotic leak (OR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.20-1.00), recurrence (OR 0.20; 95 % CI 0.07-0.55), and re-operation for recurrence (OR 0.18; 95 % CI 0.07-0.45). Postoperative hospital stay, mortality, and complications other than anastomotic leak were comparable. Conclusion: Based on the results of our meta-analysis, SSSA would appear to be the preferred procedure after ileocolic resection for CD, with reduced overall postoperative complications, especially anastomotic leak, and a decreased recurrence and re-operation rate. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media."

Objective: To update previously published meta-analyses and elucidate potential benefits of providing arginine-dominant pharmaconutrition in surgical patients specifically with regard to the timing of administration of pharmaconutrition. Design: Randomized controlled trials comparing the use of pharmaconutrition with standard nutrition in elective adult surgical patients between 1980 and 2011 were identified. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with Preferred Reporting of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. Results: Twenty studies yielding 21 sets of data met inclusion criteria. A total of 2005 patients were represented (pharmaconutrition, n = 1010; control, n = 995), in whom pharmaconutrition was provided preoperatively (k = 5), perioperatively (k = 2), or postoperatively (k = 14). No differences were seen in postoperative mortality with the provision of pharmaconutrition irrespective of timing of administration. Statistically significant reductions in infectious complications and length of stay were found with perioperative and postoperative administration. Perioperative administration was also associated with a statistically significant reduction in anastomotic dehiscence, whereas a reduction in noninfective complications was demonstrated with postoperative administration. Preoperative pharmaconutrition demonstrated no notable advantage over standard nutrition provision in any of the clinical outcomes assessed. Conclusions: This meta-analysis highlights the importance of timing as a clinical consideration in the provision of pharmaconutrition in elective gastrointestinal surgical patients and identifies areas where further research is required. ? 2013 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition."

Objectives: To compare the perioperative and long-term postoperative effectiveness of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) for lumbar arthrodesis in skeletally mature adults with degenerative disk disease (DDD) to that of the current golden standard treatment, iliac crest autologous bone graft (ICBG). Summary of Background Data: The treatment efficacy of lumbar arthrodesis in DDD is a complex clinical and economic issue for patients and health care providers. Methods: Comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using following databases: Ovid MEDLINE; Embase; Cochrane Library; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects; Methodology Register; Technology Assessment Database; and Economic Evaluation Database. The full year ranges of each database until May of 2012 were included. Results: Eight randomized controlled clinical trials of 383 citations were selected. The included studies involved 1138 participants. The pooled 2-year postoperative clinical outcomes were equivalent in BMP and ICBG groups, and exceeded minimum clinically important differences for Oswestry Disability Index, SF-36 (physical scale), and numeric rating scale (back pain). ICBG was associated with increased pain and complications at the donor site (P<0.01). The pooled average operative time was 21 minutes less in BMP versus ICBG (P<0.001). The pooled rate of additional surgical treatment was 2 times less in the BMP than in the ICBG groups (P=0.006). The pooled risk of nonunion at 24-month follow-up was 2 times less in the BMP than in the ICBG groups (P=0.037), however, this effect was likely biased. Conclusions: BMP, in particular rhBMP-2, is a good alternative to autogenous bone graft, especially in cases when harvesting of autologous bone is contraindicated or undesirable, operation time is limited, and there are no contraindications for BMP use. However, the current study did not reveal evidence robust enough to develop strong medical recommendations concerning BMP use for lumbar arthrodesis in degenerative disk disease.

Methods: A systematic review evaluating the efficacy and safety of biologic therapies compared with placebo in adult SLE patients treatment was performed. Data from studies performed before September 2013 were collected from several databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, SCIELO, Scopus, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts). Study eligibility criteria included randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; regarding treatment with biologic agents in SLE adult patients; and published in English, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Extracted data were statistically analyzed in a meta-analysis using the Review Manager (RevMan) 5.1 software. Efficacy outcomes included the SELENA-SLEDAI (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the SLE Disease Activity Index) score, the SRI (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index), normalization of low C3 (<90 mg/dL), anti-double-stranded DNA positive to negative, and no new BILAG (British Isles Lupus Assessment Group index) 1A or 2B flares. Data on safety profile included adverse events, serious and severe adverse events, death, malignancy, infections, and infusion reactions. We also evaluated withdrawals from treatment due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. Results: Thirteen randomized placebo-controlled trials met the criteria for data extraction for systematic review. A meta-analysis regarding the efficacy and safety of belimumab compared with placebo involving four of these trials was undertaken and the remainder contributed to a meta-analysis of the safety of biologic agents. In addition, two trials allowed the performance of a meta-analysis regarding the efficacy and safety of rituximab compared with placebo. Belimumab was more effective than placebo in most evaluated outcomes. No significant differences in the safety and tolerability data were observed between the belimumab and placebo groups. No differences were observed between the rituximab and placebo groups for the efficacy outcomes or safety parameters. Extracted data from the 13 studies were pooled, allowing assessment of the safety of biologic drugs. The meta-analysis revealed a satisfactory safety profile of these agents when used for SLE treatment, as there were no significant differences between the two evaluated groups (biologic agents and placebo) for all outcomes analyzed. Conclusion: Belimumab exhibited a satisfactory profile regarding efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Rituximab showed no superiority over placebo in terms of efficacy, despite its suitable safety profile. Biologic agents exhibited a good safety profile for SLE treatment, indicating that these agents are promising therapies and should be further investigated. ? 2013 Springer International Publishing."

To identify the studies to include in the review, a comprehensive electronic search without date or language restrictions was performed in April 2014. The inclusion criteria were studies of humans, including randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), and retrospective studies, with the aim of comparing fixation techniques (1 vs 2 miniplates, external oblique ridge vs lateral border miniplate placement, and geometric vs conventional miniplate) in the management of MAFs. The incidence of postoperative complications was analyzed. Only those studies in which a transoral approach had been used (with or without transbuccal instrumentation) were selected.Purpose The aim of the present study was to determine which method for internal fixation through a transoral approach has the lowest complication rate for patients with mandibular angle fractures (MAFs).Results A total of 20 publications were included: 9 RCTs, 3 CCTs, and 8 retrospective studies. Eight studies had a low risk of bias, 11 studies a moderate risk of bias, and 1 a high risk of bias. A statistically significant difference was found between a single superior border miniplate and the use of 2 miniplates. The cumulative odds ratio (OR) was 0.63, indicating that the use of 1 miniplate in MAF fixation decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 37% compared with using 2 miniplates. Comparing a miniplate placed on the external oblique ridge to one placed on the lateral surface of the mandible resulted in a cumulative OR of 2.10, indicating that the use of the transbuccal miniplate decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 110% compared with a miniplate placed on the external oblique ridge. Comparing geometric and standard miniplates, the OR was 0.29, indicating that the use of a geometric miniplate decreased the risk of postoperative complications by 71% compared with using conventional miniplates.Conclusions The results of the meta-analysis have shown that the use of 1 miniplate is superior to using 2 in reducing the incidence of postoperative complications in the management of MAFs. In addition, our results showed that the transbuccally placed lateral miniplate was better at reducing the incidence of postoperative complications than one placed on the external oblique ridge using a transoral approach. Finally, geometric miniplates performed better than conventional miniplates in reducing postoperative complications. ? 2014 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons."

This review aimed to compare the screening uptake levels of home-based self-sampling and clinic-based specimen collection for STIs (chlamydia (Chlamydia trachomatis), gonorrhoea (Neisseria gonorrhoeae) and trichomoniasis) in females aged 14-50 years. Acceptability and effect on specimen quality were determined. Methods: Sixteen electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2012. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the uptake levels of home-based self-sampling and clinic-based sampling for chlamydia, gonorrhoea and trichomoniasis in females aged 14-50 years were eligible for inclusion. The risk of bias in the trials was assessed. Risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes were meta-analysed. Results: Of 3065 papers, six studies with seven RCTs contributed to the final review. Compared with clinic-based methods, home-based screening increased uptake significantly (P-0.001-0.05) in five trials and was substantiated in a meta-analysis (RR: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 1.30-1.85; P-0.00001) of two trials. In three trials, a significant preference for home-based testing (P-0.001-0.05) was expressed. No significant difference was observed in specimen quality. Sampling was rated as easy by a significantly higher number of women (P-0.01) in the clinic group in one trial. Conclusions: The review provides evidence that home-based testing results in greater uptake of STI screening in females (14-50 years) than clinic-based testing without compromising quality in the developed world. Home collection strategies should be added to clinic-based screening programs to enhance uptake. Journal compilation ? CSIRO 2013."

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate TNP efficacy compared to conventional therapy in the treatment of deep surgical site infections (SSIs), particularly post-sternotomy infections. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing TNP to conventional treatment in deep SSIs published up to February 2012. Study quality was evaluated through the GRADE system and bias risk through the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Primary outcome was infection cure/wound resolution rate. Secondary outcomes were adverse events, length of stay, mortality, and costs. The results are presented with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) and report estimates as odds ratios (ORs). Heterogeneity was determined through the I 2 test, with &gt;50 % being considered significant. Results: Among 83 studies retrieved, 12 cohort studies including 873 patients were considered. All the studies were of low quality, 11/12 had a medium risk of bias, and none were RCTs. Wound resolution was obtained more frequently in TNP-treated patients as compared with continuous and closed drainage (OR 6.45, 95 % CI 3.46-12.00). TNP use was associated with significant reduction of length of stay compared with standard of care (mean difference: 8.21, 95 % CI -12.19, -4.23). High heterogeneity was detected between studies, explained by the TNP comparator type. Conclusions: The systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that TNP might be more effective than standard therapy in the cure of deep SSIs.

Methods An electronic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases was performed. Publications were included if they were clinical trials randomizing patients with appendicitis to SILA or CLA. Outcome measures evaluated included operating time, length of hospital stay, total postoperative complications, and, specifically, wound infection, intra-abdominal collection and ileus. Weighted mean difference was calculated for the effect size of SILA on continuous variables, and pooled odds ratios were calculated for discrete variables. Results The literature search identified seven randomized clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In total, 1108 appendicectomies were included, 555 SILA and 553 CLA procedures. There were no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of total postoperative complications, wound infection, intra-abdominal collection, ileus or length of hospital stay. However, SILA was associated with a significantly longer operating time compared with CLA (weighted mean difference 6¡P96 (95 per cent confidence interval 3¡P79 to 10¡P12) min; P < 0¡P001). Insertion of an additional port was required in 7¡P6 per cent of patients undergoing SILA.

Methods A comprehensive literature search identified 29 interventions (22 reports; N=5168 couples) that met the inclusion criteria, including enrolment of both members of a heterosexual couple, measurement of condom use at baseline and follow-up, and sufficient statistical information to calculate effect sizes. Effect sizes were analysed using fixed-effects and randomeffects assumptions; factors related to intervention efficacy were identified using metaregression. Results Overall, there were significant increases in condom use from baseline to follow-up (d+=0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.09) and significant decreases in partner concurrency (d+=0.37, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.60). Condom use increased to a greater extent when studies were conducted toward the beginning of the epidemic, were located in countries scoring lower on the Human Development Index, enrolled serodiscordant couples, and delivered intervention content in multiple contexts. Couples who had been together longer, reported higher incidence of sexually transmitted infection, were provided voluntary counselling and testing, and provided outcome measures during face-to-face interviews also reported larger increases in condom use. Conclusions Couple-based interventions are efficacious in reducing unprotected sex within the context of romantic relationships.

The objective of this study was to review and quantify the association between increased BMI and risk of spinal SSI in adults. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search for relevant studies using PubMed, Embase, and references of published manuscripts. Study-specific risk measures were transformed into slope estimates and combined using the random effects meta-analysis model to establish the risk of SSI associated with every 5-unit increase in BMI. Results: Thirty-four articles underwent full-text review. Variations were noted among these studies in relation to SSI diagnosis criteria and BMI cut-off levels used to define obesity. Data from 12 retrospective studies were included in the analyses. Results showed that BMI was significantly positively associated with the risk of spinal SSI. Unadjusted risk estimates demonstrated that a 5-unit increase in BMI was associated with 13 % increased risk of SSI [Crude odds ratio (OR): 1.13; 95 % CI: 1.07-1.19, p < 0.0001]. Pooling of risk estimates adjusted for diabetes and other confounders resulted in a 21 % increase in risk of spinal SSI for every 5-unit increase in BMI (adjusted OR: 1.21; 95 % CI 1.13-1.29, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Higher BMI is associated with the increased risk of SSI following spine surgery.

A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 2009 raised concerns over increased graft occlusion rates in veins harvested endoscopically. This NEJM paper has been criticized, but has nonetheless been influential in guiding practice. We have undertaken this meta-analysis to provide evidence on the clinical outcomes of endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH), so that clinicians can make an informed judgement about whether this technique, popular as it is with patients, should still be offered. We systematically reviewed the global literature and performed a meta-analysis of clinical outcomes after endoscopic and open vein harvesting. In all outcomes, endoscopic harvesting appears to be equal, if not superior, to open harvesting. The suspicion of higher rates of vein graft occlusion was not borne out by randomized studies. When considering evidence from only randomized studies, there is no statistical difference in vein graft stenosis or occlusion between open and endoscopically harvested veins. In conclusion, EVH reduces pain and leg wound complications. At a median follow-up of 2.6 years, we found no significant difference in mortality, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, angina recurrence, vein graft stenosis or occlusion. Therefore, the authors support the ongoing use of endoscopic harvesting techniques. ? Crown copyright 2013."

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of p38 MAPK inhibitors in patients with active RA. Searches were conducted in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. We identified three articles including four RCTs with analysis on the efficacy and safety of p38 inhibitors for the treatment of RA. Our meta-analysis showed that a better American College of Rheumatology 20 % improvement (ACR20) was observed in the p38 inhibitors group compared with the placebo group, but there were no meaningful differences in ACR50, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints response, and CRP levels between two groups past week 12. The overall adverse events were similar between placebo and treatment groups. In conclusion, p38 MAPK inhibitors showed modest efficacy in patients with RA. However, this conclusion is based on the small number of available studies and inadequate sample size, and more well-designed RCTs will be necessary to determine the role of p38 MAPK inhibitors in RA. ? 2013 Clinical Rheumatology."

The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis has been to assess and validate the safety and feasibility of MIVAT when compared to conventional thyroidectomy (CT) and to verify other potential benefits and drawbacks. Methods: A literature search for prospective randomized trials comparing MIVAT and CT was performed. Trials were reviewed for the primary outcome measures: overall morbidity, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, postoperative hypocalcemia, and postoperative hematoma; and for the secondary outcome measures: operative time, conversion to standard procedure, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative drain insertion, nodule size and thyroid weight, postoperative pain evaluation, length of hospital stay, patient satisfactory score, and cosmetics results. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated for continuous variables and odds ratio for qualitative variables. Results: Nine prospective randomized studies comparing MIVAT and CT were analyzed. Overall, 581 patients were randomized to either MIVAT (289, 49.7 %) or CT (292, 50.3 %). The primary outcome measures of MIVAT were comparable with those of CT without statistically significant difference. Patients who underwent MIVAT experienced significantly less pain than those operated on conventionally during the whole postoperative period. Patient satisfactory score significantly favored MIVAT (9.0 vs. 6.8, SMD = -3.388, 95 % CI = -5.720 to -1.057). Operative time was significantly longer in MIVAT (75.2 vs. 59.2 min, SMD = 1.246, 95 % CI = 0.227-2.266). Conclusions: MIVAT is a safe and feasible alternative for the removal of small-volume benign thyroid disease and low-risk papillary thyroid carcinomas showing better cosmetics results and less postoperative pain but significantly longer operative time when compared to CT. New multicenter randomized studies are needed to evaluate the technique in more complex circumstances such as intermediate-risk thyroid cancer, lymph node removal, thyroiditis, and Graves' disease. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

While recent guidelines advise against this practice, quantitative summarization of the supporting evidence is not available. Materials and methods: We systematically identified studies that compared toxic effect or survival outcomes between obese and normal-weight adults receiving chemotherapy dosed by actual body weight (ABW). We pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effects models. Results: Of 5490 records screened, 12 studies representing 9314 relevant patients met inclusion criteria. The large majority of reported toxic effect and survival outcomes did not statistically differ between obese and normal-weight subjects. Exceptions included five studies in which one or more toxic effect or survival outcomes statistically favored obese patients, and one study that statistically favored normal-weight patients. Pooling usable data, rates of toxic effects were similar or lower in obese patients (grade 3/4 hematologic toxic effect: OR 0.73, CI 0.55-0.98, 4 studies; grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxic effect: OR 0.98, CI 0.76-1.26, 3 subgroups; any grade 3/4 toxic effect: OR 0.75, CI 0.65-0.87, three studies). Conclusions: Obese patients receiving chemotherapy based on ABW experience similar or lower rates of toxic effects compared with normal-weight patients, and survival outcomes do not differ. ?

When conservative treatments such as facet injections fail, fusion may be indicated. We reviewed published series describing posterior fusions for atlantoaxial osteoarthritis of the facet joints. Methods: Online databases were searched for English-language articles describing the diagnosis and treatment of AAOA. Twenty-three studies reporting on 246 patients treated with posterior fusion for lateral AAOA fulfilled inclusion criteria. Standard statistical and formal meta-analytic techniques were used to assess outcomes. Results: All studies provided class III evidence. The 30-day perioperative mortality was 1.2% and neurologic injury did not occur. Patients were followed for a mean of nearly 5 years. Fusion was successful in 98% of patients with a single operation and with 99.5% of patients after revision surgery. Intractable preoperative neck pain either resolved completely or improved in 97.7% of patients. Using meta-analytic techniques, the point estimate for improvement or resolution of pain was 92.6% (confidence interval = 86.8%-96.0%) and the rate of arthrodesis for AAOA was 92.2% (confidence interval = 85.6%-95.9%) and there were no differences among the various techniques used for fusion. Operative complications were few. Conclusions: Posterior C1-2 fusion is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with intractable neck pain secondary to lateral AAOA. Modern fusion options offer a high rate of arthrodesis and low risk of morbidity if conservative therapies fail to provide adequate pain relief. ? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

The aim of the present systematic review was to compare operation time and postoperative morbidity for ultrasonic and electrothermal bipolar-activated devices with conventional hemostasis techniques and with each other in open thyroidectomy. Methods: A systematic literature search (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and ISI Web of Science) was performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing conventional hemostasis techniques, ultrasonic devices (Harmonic? scalpel) and/or electrothermal bipolar-activated vessel sealing systems (Ligasure?) during open thyroidectomy. For the primary endpoint (operation time), a network meta-analysis with Bayesian random effects model was performed. Pairwise meta-analyses with random effects were calculated for primary and secondary endpoints. Results: One hundred sixteen publications were evaluated for eligibility; 35 RCTs (4,061 patients) were included. There was considerable methodological and clinical heterogeneity of included trials. The Harmonic scalpel significantly reduced operation time compared with conventional techniques (22.26 min, 22.7 min in the inconsistency model). The use of Ligasure significantly reduced operation time in total thyroidectomy (13.84 min in the consistency model, 12.18 min in the inconsistency model). In direct comparison, operations with the Harmonic scalpel were faster than with Ligasure (8.42 min in the consistency model, 2.45 min in the inconsistency model). The rates of recurrent nerve palsy and postoperative hypocalcaemia did not significantly differ in the intervention groups. Conclusions: This meta-analysis shows superiority of ultrasonic devices in terms of operation time compared with conventional hemostasis techniques in thyroid surgery, with no detriment to safety outcomes. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Probioticsmay be a promising solution. OBJECTIVE To examine whether probiotics are effective in the prevention/management of crying (""colic"") in infants 3 months or younger. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, supplemented by the metaRegister of Controlled Trials. STUDY SELECTION Studies that randomized infants 3 months or younger to oral probiotics vs placebo or no or standard treatment with the outcome of infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress or diagnosis of ""infant colic."" Twelve of the 1180 initially identified studies were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS This review/meta-analysiswas conducted according to guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, with reporting following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Data were independently extracted by 3 of us. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S) Infant crying, measured as the duration or number of episodes of infant crying/distress, or diagnosis of ""infant colic."" RESULTS Of the 12 trials (1825 infants) reviewed, 6 suggested probiotics reduced crying, and 6 did not. Three of the 5 management trials concluded probiotics effectively treat colic in breastfed babies; 1 suggested possible effectiveness in formula-fed babies with colic, and 1 suggested ineffectiveness in breastfed babies with colic.Meta-analysis of 3 small trials of breastfed infants with colic found that Lactobacillus reuteri markedly reduced crying time at 21 days (median difference, -65 minutes/d; 95%CI, -86 to -44). However, all trials had potential biases. Meanwhile, of 7 prevention trials, 2 suggested possible benefits. Considerable variability in the study populations, study type, delivery mode/dose of probiotic supplementation, and outcomes precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although L reuteri may be effective as treatment for crying in exclusively breastfed infants with colic, there is still insufficient evidence to support probiotic use to manage colic, especially in formula-fed infants, or to prevent infant crying. Results from larger rigorously designed studies applicable to all crying infants will help draw more definitive conclusions. Copyright 2013 American Medical Association."

Currently, lamivudine plus adefovir combination therapy or entecavir monotherapy is usually used for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B (CHB). However, there are few systematic comparisons between the efficacy of lamivudine plus adefovir and the efficacy of entecavir in the treatment of these patients. Objective: The goal of this systematic study and meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of lamivudine plus adefovir compared with entecavir for the treatment of patients with lamivudine-resistant CHB. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of PUBMED, Web of Science, WANFANG database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, were screened to obtain citations from January 1990 to January 2012 in this study. Data analysis was done by using the Review Manager Software 5.1. Results: Eight studies were suitable for analysis. A total of 696 patients with lamivudine-resistant CHB were studied and grouped according to treatment: 341 patients in the entecavir group and 355 patients in the lamivudine plus adefovir group. The results found that the rates of undetectable hepatitis B virus DNA levels, alanine aminotransferase normalization, hepatitis B e antigen loss, and hepatitis B e antigen seroconversion were not significantly different between the lamivudine plus adefovir group and the entecavir group. Moreover, the rate of adverse reactions was also not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, virologic breakthrough for the patients with lamivudine resistance was higher in the entecavir group than in the lamivudine plus adefovir group. Conclusions: For these CHB patients with lamivudine resistance, lamivudine plus adefovir was a better treatment option than entecavir alone. ? 2013 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc."

Methods: Five databases were searched for studies on prognostic factors and NT mortality published up to April 2013 to identify studies relevant to this review. Prognostic factors of interest were birth weight, age at onset of symptoms, age at presentation, delay in presentation, and duration of hospitalization. Odds ratios (ORs) for prognostic factors and mortality were estimated by random effects models and stratified analyses for all studies. Results: Sixteen studies including a total of 4535 neonates were included in the analysis: nine from Africa, five from Asia, and two from Europe. The prognostic factors identified consistently in the studies were birth weight, age at onset of symptoms, and age at presentation. Of the 16 studies, only one assessed all three prognostic factors, five studies assessed two prognostic factors, and 10 studies assessed one prognostic factor. Neonates with a low birth weight were more likely to have an increased odds of NT death (OR 2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-3.37) than normal weight neonates. This mortality risk was exacerbated for low birth weight neonates with age at onset ?6 days (OR 6.80, 95% CI 2.42-19.11). Age at onset ?5-7 days was associated with an increased odds of NT death. Conclusions: Low birth weight predicted an increased odds of death by NT. Age at onset ?5-7 days to diagnosis is crucial in determining survival among neonates with tetanus. ? 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases."

The underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview on those serum lipid profile changes, and to discuss possible underlying biological mechanisms and the role of lipids in malaria pathogenesis. A systematic review and meta-analysis to determine lipid profile changes during malaria was conducted, following PRISMA guidelines. Without language restrictions, Medline/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, LILACS, Biosis Previews and the African Index Medicus were searched for studies published up to 11 July, 2013, that measured serum lipid parameters in malaria patients. Also, major trial registries were searched. Mean differences in lipid profile parameters were combined in fixed and random effects meta-analysis, with a separate analysis for different groups of controls (healthy, other febrile illnesses or very low parasitaemia). These parameters were also compared between severe malaria and uncomplicated malaria. Funnel plots were used to test for publication bias. Of 2,518 studies reviewed, 42 met the criteria for inclusion in the qualitative analysis, and of these, 15 reported the necessary data for inclusion in the meta-analysis for cholesterol; nine for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), eight for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and nine for triglycerides, respectively. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL concentrations were lower in malaria and other febrile diseases compared to healthy controls. The decline was more pronounced and statistically significant during malaria compared to other febrile diseases. These results were consistent across included studies. Triglycerides were raised compared to healthy controls, but not statistically significant when compared to symptomatic controls. This meta-analysis suggests that the observed lipid profile changes are characteristic for malaria. Although a definite link with the pathogenesis of malaria cannot yet be demonstrated, plausible hypotheses of biological mechanisms involving host lipid alterations and the pathogenesis of malaria exist. An increased research effort to elucidate the precise pathways is warranted, since this could lead to better understanding of malaria pathophysiology and consequently to novel treatment approaches."

There was an increasing trend in enteric fever caused by SPA during the last 2 decades (P < .01). We observed sharply increasing trends in resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin for both ST and SPA. In contrast, multi-drug resistance (MDR), resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics such as chloram-phenicol and co-trimoxazole have significantly decreased for both organisms. The resistance to ceftriaxone has remained low, suggesting it is likely to remain useful as a reserve antibiotic for treatment. Trends in decreasing resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics and decreasing MDR provide an opportunity to reconsider these first-line antimicrobials as therapeutic options. ?

We conducted a systematic review to determine the magnitude of infant/baby LTFU along the PMTCT cascade. Methods: Eligible publications reported infant LTFU outcomes from standard care PMTCT programs (not intervention studies) at any stage of the cascade. Literature searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, Web of Knowledge, CINAHL Plus, and Maternity and Infant Care. Extracted data included setting, methods of follow-up, PMTCT regimens, and proportion and timing of LTFU. For programs in sub-Saharan Africa, random-effects meta-analysis was done using Stata v10. Because of heterogeneity, predictive intervals (PrIs; approximate 95% confidence intervals of a future study based on extent of observed heterogeneity) were computed. Results: A total of 826 papers were identified; 25 publications were eligible. Studies were published from 2001 to 2012 and were mostly from sub-Saharan Africa (three were from India, one from UK and one from Ireland). There was extensive heterogeneity in findings. Eight studies reported on LTFU of pregnant HIV-positive women between antenatal care (ANC) registration and delivery, which ranged from 10.9 to 68.1%, pooled proportion 49.08% [95% confidence interval (CI) 39.6-60.9%], and PrI 22.0-100%. Fourteen studies reported LTFU of infants within 3 months of delivery, range 4.8-75%, pooled proportion 33.9% (27.6-41.5), and PrI 15.4-74.2. Children were also lost after HIV testing; this was reported in five studies, pooled estimate 45.5% (35.9-57.6), PrI 18.7-100%. Programs that actively tracked defaulters had better retention outcomes. Conclusion: There is unacceptable infant LTFU from PMTCT programs.

Results Of 301 identified studies, 29 were included. Across 22 studies (n=8360), weighted mean HPV vaccine acceptability=50.4 (SD 21.5) (100-point scale). Among 16 studies (n=5048) included in meta-Analyses, perceived HPV vaccine benefits, anticipatory regret, partner thinks one should get vaccine and healthcare provider recommendation had medium effect sizes, and the following factors had small effect sizes on HPV vaccine acceptability: perceived HPV vaccine effectiveness, need for multiple shots, fear of needles, fear of side effects, supportive/accepting social environment, perceived risk/susceptibility to HPV, perceived HPV severity, number of lifetime sexual partners, having a current sex partner, non-receipt of hepatitis B vaccine, smoking cigarettes, history of sexually transmitted infection, HPV awareness, HPV knowledge, cost, logistical barriers, being employed and non-white ethnicity. Conclusions Public health campaigns that promote positive HPV vaccine attitudes and awareness about HPV risk in men, and interventions to promote healthcare provider recommendation of HPV vaccination for boys and mitigate obstacles due to cost and logistical barriers may support HPV vaccine acceptability for men. Future investigations employing rigorous designs, including intervention studies, are needed to support effective HPV vaccine promotion among men."

A meta-analysis,2013,International Orthopaedics,10.1007/s00264-013-2053-8,23982636,"Purpose: The clinical use of closed-suction drainage, which aims to reduce postoperative wound haematomas and infection, is common. This study was performed to determine whether closed-suction drainage is safe and effective in promoting wound healing and reducing blood loss and other complications compared with no-drainage in total hip arthroplasty. Methods: The literature search was based on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The data were evaluated using the generic evaluation tool designed by the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group, and then analysed using RevMan 5.0. Twenty randomised controlled trials involving 3,186 patients were included in our analysis. Results: The results of our meta-analysis indicate that closed-suction drainage reduces the requirement for dressing reinforcement, but increases the rate of homologous blood transfusion. No significant difference was observed in the incidence of infection, blood loss, changes in haemoglobin and haematocrit, functional assessment, or other complications when the drainage group was compared with the no-drainage group. Conclusions: Our results of the comparison between closed-suction drainage and no drainage in THA have indicated that the routine use of closed-suction drainage for elective total hip arthroplasty may be of more harm than benefit. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Methods: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, and Cochrane Central were searched from January 2000 to December 2012 to collect the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing UGFS, EVLA, RFA, and surgery or combinations of these for treatment of varicose vein. Two independent reviewers determined study eligibility and extracted descriptive, methodologic, and outcome data. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) across studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.2. Results: Twenty-two eligible studies (25 randomized controlled trials) were found. Surgery was associated with a non-significant reduction in the risk of primary failure compared with UGFS (RR=3.42) and RFA (RR=1.32). The endovenous procedure had advantages over surgery in primary failure; RR=0.88(EVLA), recurrence rate; RR=0.70 (EVLA), haematoma: RR=0.52 (EVLA) & RR=0.13 (RFA), infections: RR=0.35 (EVLA) & RR=0.36 (RFA), and paresthesia: RR=0.69 (EVLA).

Objective: Estimation level of immunity to toxoplasmosis in reproductive ages. Materials and Methods: All published papers in main national and international databases were systematically searched for some specific keywords to find the related studies up to 2012. We selected only original articles that either reported percentage of positive anti toxoplasma IgG or total anti toxoplasma antibody by using ELISA or IFAT method (provided that the titer ?1.20 is considered positive for IFAT) in childbearing age women. Results: Studies involved a total of 13480 participants. The maximum and minimum reported prevalence rates of anti-toxoplasma IgG antibody using IFTA serological method were 21.8% and 54%; and using ELISA serological method were 23% and 64%, respectively. The overall estimation for prevalence of antitoxoplasma IgG antibody using IFTA serological method was 34.5% (95% CI: 28.5-40.5); and using ELISA method was 37.6% (95% CI: 30.4-44.9). The overall estimation for prevalence of anti-toxoplasma total antibody was 39.9% (95% CI: 26.1-53.7). Conclusion: In Iran, screening of toxoplasma is not routinely performed yet, while the incidence of toxoplasmosis is too high to justify routine screening. Prenatal screening can help to identify mothers susceptible to infection. Screening for the presence of antibodies allows primary prevention of toxoplasmosis infection where eating habits and hygiene practices have clearly been identified as risk factors. ? 2017, Research and Clinical Center for Infertitlity.

The second aim was to compare these results with those obtained from an analysis of non-RCTs and observational studies. Randomized controlled trials were identified using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane CENTRAL, from 1990 to September 2012. RevMan version 5.1 and OpenMeta[Analyst] were used for analyses of RCT and non-RCTs, respectively. Six eligible studies with 1184 patients between 12 and 80 years of age were included in RCTs analysis. Fifteen adverse events were investigated. In this first part of the analysis, no adverse events were statistically significantly associated with zonisamide. In the non-RCT analysis, a high incidence of weight loss and headache was found. In RCTs, zonisamide was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of adverse event-related study withdrawals [RR (99% CI) = 1.81 (1.07-3.08)]. Although our study revealed no statistically significantly associated adverse effects (AEs) with zonisamide, this is very likely a consequence of the small numbers in the RCTs available. The limited data available from the studies appear to reveal no major safety concerns related to zonisamide. However, the high incidence of weight loss and headache in the non-RCTs suggests that these AEs could be of clinical significance. ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Sample We identified 1092 references, of which 31 were finally included, in addition to influenza surveillance reports. We also used information from the 10 reports from the collaborative group for epidemiological surveillance of influenza and other respiratory virus (GROG), and information retrieved from the WHO global flu database FLUNET. Main outcome measures Incidence, percentage of influenza specimens out of the total received by influenza centers and resource-use outcomes. Results A total of 483 130 specimens of patients with influenza were analyzed. Meta-analysis showed an annual rate of 36 080 (95%CI 28 550 43 610) influenza-like illness per 100 000 persons-years. The percentage of influenza out of total specimens received by influenza centers ranged between 4.66% and 15.42%, with type A the most prevalent, and A subtype H3 predominating. The mean length of stay at hospital due to influenza ranged between 5.8 12.9 days, total workdays lost due to influenza-like illnesses were 17 150 days, and the mean direct cost of hospitalization was US$575 per laboratory-confirmed influenza case.

Studies have suggested that albumin has a value in cirrhotic patients undergoing paracentesis but its value in infection and sepsis is less clear. We planned to perform a meta-analysis of the risk of adverse outcomes in cirrhotic patients with and without albumin use. Methods. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE in January 2013 for randomized studies of cirrhotic patients that reported the risk of adverse events and mortality with albumin and no albumin exposure. We performed random effects meta-analysis and assessed heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. Results. Our review included 16 studies covering 1,518 patients. The use of albumin in paracentesis was associated with significantly reduced risk of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (OR 0.26 95%, CI 0.08-0.93) and there was a nonsignificant difference in death, encephalopathy, hyponatraemia, readmission, and renal impairment.

Clinicians practicing in such settings have reported a high incidence of direct obstetric complications among HIV-infected women, but the evidence supporting this is unclear. The aim of this systematic review is to establish whether HIV-infected women are at increased risk of direct obstetric complications.Methods and findings:Studies comparing the frequency of obstetric haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, dystocia and intrauterine infections in HIV-infected and uninfected women were identified. Summary estimates of the odds ratio (OR) for the association between HIV and each obstetric complication were calculated through meta-analyses. In total, 44 studies were included providing 66 data sets; 17 on haemorrhage, 19 on hypertensive disorders, five on dystocia and 25 on intrauterine infections. Meta-analysis of the OR from studies including vaginal deliveries indicated that HIV-infected women had over three times the risk of a puerperal sepsis compared with HIV-uninfected women [pooled OR: 3.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.00-5.85]; this figure increased to nearly six amongst studies only including women who delivered by caesarean (pooled OR: 5.81, 95% CI: 2.42-13.97). For other obstetric complications the evidence was weak and inconsistent.Conclusions:The higher risk of intrauterine infections in HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women may require targeted strategies involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics during labour. However, as the huge excess of pregnancy-related mortality in HIV-infected women is unlikely to be due to a higher risk of direct obstetric complications, reducing this mortality will require non obstetric interventions involving access to ART in both pregnant and non-pregnant women. ? 2013 Calvert, Ronsmans."

Methods: Estimates were derived from a random effects meta-analysis of prospective studies reporting HIV status, utilization of ART, and the presence of NCI determined using the International HIV Dementia Scale. Results: Sixteen studies with quality data from seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa up to June 2012 were included. Among HIV patients, the frequency of NCI pre-ART was 42.37% (95% confidence interval (CI) 32.18-52.56%), and among those on ART for ?6 months was 30.39% (95% CI 13.17-47.61%). Respective NCI estimates in studies from Uganda were 46.49% (95% CI 30.62-62.37%) and 28.50% (95% CI -1.31-58.30%). NCI was more common among patients with a concomitant psychiatric ailment. HIV-positive patients compared to HIV-negative controls were predisposed to NCI (odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.68-25.08); the estimated unadjusted attributable risk of HIV infection leading to NCI was 85%. Meta-regression showed no associations between age, gender, CD4 cell counts, or years of education with NCI. Patients on ART were less likely to have NCI compared to HIV-infected pre-ART patients, with OR 0.36 (95% CI 0.19-0.69). In longitudinal studies with the same patients followed before and at ?6 months after ART, the OR of NCI after ART compared to pre-ART was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14-0.37). The combined burden of NCI among pre-ART and on-ART patients in Sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 8121910 (95% CI 5772140-10471680). No publication bias was observed, although residual confounding from differing environmental factors, stages of HIV infection, and viral clades might be a limitation. Conclusions: HIV strongly predisposes to NCI leading to a huge burden in Sub-Saharan Africa, and scale-up of ART can substantially reduce it. ? 2013 International Society for Infectious Diseases."

Methods: RCTs comparing the effects of SILA and CTLA were searched for in PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase. Operative time, the pain visual analogue scales scores (VAS scores), dose of analgesics, postoperative complications, hospital charges, and duration of postoperative hospitalization in SILA and CTLA were pooled and compared by meta-analysis. Odds ratios and weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effect of SILA. Result: Eight original RCTs investigating 760 adults and 684 children, 1,444 patients in total, of whom 721 received SILA only and 723 received CTLA only, met the inclusion criteria. Both in adults and children, the mean operative time was significantly longer in SILA than CTLA (WMD5.45, 95 % CI 2.15 to 8.75, p = 0.01). Compared with CTLA, in children, SILA have higher analgesic consumption (WMD 0.69, 95 % CI 0.08 to 1.3, p = 0.03) and greater hospital charges (WMD 0.87, 95 % CI 1.26 to 1.48, p = 0.005), which was not statistically different in adults (p > 0.05). Pooling the results for SILA and CTLA revealed no significant difference in VAS scores, wound infection rate, overall complications, and postoperative hospital stay. Conclusion: SILA failed to show any obvious advantages over CTLA in perioperative and postoperative outcomes.

However, this generalization may not apply to older adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Regardless of age, suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) can lead to increased viral load, immunosuppression, drug-resistant viral strains, co-morbidities, and opportunistic infections. Understanding trends of adherence to ART among older adults is critical, especially as the population of people living with HIV grows older. Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine if older individuals with HIV are less likely to be non-adherent to antiretroviral therapy than younger individuals with HIV. Design: A systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles evaluating adherence to ART in older adults. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts, applied inclusion criteria, and appraised study quality. The bibliographies of qualifying studies were searched. Data were abstracted from studies by two independent authors. Meta-analyses were conducted, and adherence levels were reported as the relative risk of non-adherence in older individuals compared to younger individuals. Results: The systematic search yielded 1,848 abstracts. Twelve studies met full inclusion criteria. The overall meta-analysis found that older age reduced risk for non-adherence by 27 % (relative risk (RR) 0.72, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.64-0.82). Studies assessing both short-term and long-term adherence demonstrated a significant reduction in non-adherence among older patients (RR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.64-0.87 and RR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50-0.85, respectively). Conclusions: Older adults with HIV have a reduced risk for non-adherence to ART than their younger counterparts. Future studies should seek to elucidate contributing factors of adherence among older individuals with HIV. ? 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA)."

Studies comparing RARC and open radical cystectomy (ORC) have reported conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the efficacy and advantages of RARC compared with ORC.Methods: An electronic database search of PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to July 8, 2012. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed based on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational comparative studies assessing the two techniques.Results: One RCT, eight studies with prospectively collected data, and four retrospective studies were identified, including 962 cases. Although RARC was associated with longer operative time (p<. 0.001), patients in this group might benefit from less overall perioperative complications (p=0.04), more lymph node yield (p= 0.009), less estimated blood loss (p<. 0.001), a lower need for perioperative transfusion (p<. 0.001), and shorter length of hospital stay (p<0.001). Positive surgical margins did not differ significantly between techniques. Sensitivity analysis with prospective studies showed similar results to the original analysis, but no significant difference of lymph node yield and length of stay between two techniques.Conclusions: RARC is a mini-invasive alternative to ORC with less overall perioperative complications, more lymph node yields, less estimated blood loss, less need for a perioperative transfusion, and shorter length of stay. ? 2012 Elsevier Ltd."

Methods: We searched electronic databases through August 2011 for randomized controlled trials and observational studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the regimens used to treat diseases produced by B. henselae, B. quintana, and B. bacilliformis. Study selection and appraisal were done in duplicate. Results: We found two randomized and seven non-randomized studies at high risk of bias. For cat scratch disease, antibiotics did not significantly affect the cure rate or time to achieve cure. In chronic bacteremia, gentamicin and doxycycline significantly increased the resolution rate.

Methods: We searched eight databases to retrieve all peer-reviewed publications reporting original HRQOL data for persons with TB. All retrieved abstracts were considered for full-text review if HRQOL was quantitatively assessed among subjects with TB. Full-text articles were reviewed by two independent reviewers using a standardized abstraction form to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, questionnaire administration, and mean HRQOL scores. Meta-analyses were performed for standardized mean differences in HRQOL scores, comparing subjects treated for active TB with subjects treated for latent TB infection (LTBI), or with healthy controls, at similar time points with respect to diagnosis and/or treatment. Results: From over 15,000 abstracts retrieved, 76 full-text articles were reviewed, which represented 28 unique cohorts (6,028 subjects) reporting HRQOL among subjects with active TB; 42 % were women and mean age was 42 years. Data on key social and behavioral determinants were limited. Within individual studies and in meta-analyses, subjects with active TB disease consistently reported worse HRQOL than concurrently evaluated subjects treated for LTBI. However, meaningful improvements in HRQOL throughout active TB treatment were reported by longitudinal studies. Conclusions: In a variety of studies, in different settings and using different instruments, subjects with active TB consistently reported poorer HRQOL than persons treated for LTBI.

Despite their benefit in rheumatoid disease, selective antitumor necrosis factor agents failed to improve outcome in early sepsis trials in the 1990s. However, data from additional sepsis trials testing these agents are now available. We therefore sought to determine the effect on survival of selective antitumor necrosis factor agents in randomized clinical sepsis trials.. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized human sepsis trials of selective antitumor necrosis factor agents reporting survival rates. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently collected relevant data on study characteristics, treatment interventions, and patients from each study. Data Synthesis: Antitumor necrosis factor agents in 15 sepsis trials (n = 8,896 patients) meeting inclusion criteria had similar effects (I = 0, p = 0.84) and compared with controls (placebo in 14 trials or a lower dose in one trial) overall decreased the relative risk of death (95% CI) (0.93 [0.88-0.98], p = 0.01). In subgroup analysis, tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies (10 trials, n = 6,818) alone produced a significant survival benefit (0.93 [0.87, 0.99], p = 0.02) (I = 0, p = 0.83). Tumor necrosis factor polyclonal antibodies (two trials, n = 151) and low-molecular-weight soluble receptor (two trials, n = 1,786) had similar beneficial effects to antitumor necrosis factor agents overall (0.82 [0.49-1.37], p = 0.45; 0.93 [0.81-1.08], p = 0.33, respectively). The effect of tumor necrosis factor high-molecular-weight soluble receptor (one trial, n = 141) was not significantly different from other agents but was on the side of harm (1.50 [0.86-2.61], p = 0.16). Conclusion: Antitumor necrosis factor agents produced a modest but significant decrease in the risk of dying with sepsis. Prior individual trials failed to demonstrate benefit, likely because they were underpowered. A definitive trial demonstrating the potential benefit of such agents might require 10,000 or more patients with sepsis.

A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and other databases till 3 May 2013. All included studies were analyzed with the use of the Review Manager 5.1.0. software according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement protocol. Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing tofacitinib with placebo were identified. Two of them additionally provided the comparison with adalimumab. However, only eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. The overall results of the meta-analysis showed that tofacitinib provided a statistically significant improvement according to the response criteria (ACR20/50/70) after 12 weeks of treatment when compared to placebo (p < 0.00001). Moreover, it was demonstrated that tofacitinib was significantly superior to adalimumab in achieving the ACR50 response criteria at week 12 (p = 0.003). For the safety analysis, there were no statistically significant differences between tofacitinib-, adalimumab-, and placebo-treated patients in respect to the risk of serious adverse events or treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions (p > 0.05). The findings of this systematic review with meta-analysis indicate that tofacitinib monotherapy or with background methotrexate provides early statistically significant and clinically important improvement in rheumatoid arthritis symptoms and has an acceptable safety profile comparable to that of placebo. The results of the present meta-analysis show that the frequency of serious adverse events was not increased after tofacitinib treatment. In addition, tofacitinib might provide an effective treatment option compared to intravenous or subcutaneous biological DMARDs, as suggested by the result of the comparison made regarding tofacitinib vs. adalimumab ACR50 response rate. ? 2013 The Author(s)."

Published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) had small sample sizes, and meta-analyses have included too few studies to draw conclusive results for the assessment of tolerability, efficacy and safety of perampanel. There is a need to conduct a meta-analysis with a larger dataset and an appropriate study design. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the efficacy and safety of perampanel in the treatment of partial-onset epilepsy. Methods: Electronic and clinical trials databases were searched for RCTs of perampanel published up to March 2013. Outcomes of interest were 50 % responder rates, seizure freedom, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and incidence of withdrawal. Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the outcomes of interest. Results: Five RCTs with a total of 1,678 subjects were included. The 50 % responder rates were significantly greater in patients receiving 4, 8 and 12 mg perampanel versus placebo, with risk ratios of 1.54 (95 % CI 1.11-2.13), 1.80 (95 % CI 1.38-2.35) and 1.72 (95 % CI 1.17-2.52), respectively. There was no statistical evidence of a difference in seizure freedom between 8 or 12 mg perampanel and placebo. Of the five commonly reported TEAEs included, both dizziness and somnolence were statistically associated with 8 mg perampanel, whilst dizziness was statistically associated with 12 mg perampanel. Incidences of withdrawal due to adverse events were significantly higher in the 8 mg and 12 mg perampanel groups versus placebo. Conclusion: The use of perampanel resulted in a statistically significant reduction of seizure frequency with respect to the 50 % responder rate in patients with partial-onset epilepsy. Perampanel is well tolerated at 4 mg and reasonably tolerated at 8 and 12 mg. Further clinical and pharmacovigilance studies are required to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of perampanel in the management of other types of epilepsy. ? 2013 The Author(s)."

Hence, they reduce the transmission of the parasite from the patient to the mosquitoes. The present study aimed to assess evidence for this hypothesis from controlled trials. Methods. All controlled clinical trials evaluating the transmission blocking activity of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine with or without other antimalarials were included in this systematic review. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Medscape and the Cochrane library were systematically searched without language, publication status or date restrictions. The literature references were also scanned manually. The last search was run on July 15, 2013. Search terms included artemisinin derivatives, primaquine, malaria transmission, transmission blocking/reducing drugs and mosquito infection. The outcome measure was the mosquito infectivity rate after treatment of patients. Data were compared using odds ratio (OR), in random effects models. Results: Nine trials with a total of 13,831 mosquitoes were included in the meta-analysis. After combining the trials, the transmission of P. falciparum to Anopheles mosquitoes were lower in artesunate, artemether-lumefantrine and primaquine groups as compared with their control counterparts with OR of 0.36 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.14-0.90), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.79) and 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.73); respectively. In non-comparative longitudinal studies, the use of a single-dose of primaquine was shown to deter the transmission of malaria briefly. Conclusion: Evidence on the transmission blocking effect of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine is conclusive. Trials evaluating the combined impact of artemisinin derivatives and primaquine on malaria transmission is urgently needed. ? 2013 Abay; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The World Health Organization currently recommends 'dry cord care' because of insufficient data in favor of or against topical application of an antiseptic. The primary objective of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of application of chlorhexidine (CHX) to the umbilical cord to children born in low income countries on cord infection (omphalitis) and neonatal mortality. Standardized guidelines of Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) were followed to generate estimates of effectiveness of topical chlorhexidine application to umbilical cord for prevention of sepsis specific mortality, for inclusion in the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Methods. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources included Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINHAL and WHO international clinical trials registry. Only randomized trials were included. Studies of children in hospital settings were excluded. The comparison group received no application to the umbilical cord (dry cord care), no intervention, or a non-CHX intervention. Primary outcomes were omphalitis and all-cause neonatal mortality. Results: There were three cluster-randomised community trials (total participants 54,624) conducted in Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan that assessed impact of CHX application to the newborn umbilical cord for prevention of cord infection and mortality. Application of any CHX to the umbilical cord of the newborn led to a 23% reduction in all-cause neonatal mortality in the intervention group compared to control [RR 0.77, 95 % CI 0.63, 0.94; random effects model, I¡±ssup¡±2¡±esup¡±=50 %]. The reduction in omphalitis ranged from 27 % to 56 % compared to control group depending on severity of infection. Based on CHERG rules, effect size for all-cause mortality was used for inclusion to LiST model as a proxy for sepsis specific mortality. Conclusions: Application of CHX to newborn umbilical cord can significantly reduce incidence of umbilical cord infection and all-cause mortality among home births in community settings. This inexpensive and simple intervention can save a significant number of newborn lives in developing countries. ? 2013Imdad et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

However, available data on their screening efficacy is inconsistent. Methods: English articles from Pubmed, EMBASE, and Web of Science published before December 1, 2012 were analyzed. The Quality Assessment for Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy (QUADAS) tool was used to evaluate the quality of eligible studies. Performance characteristics of WBCs and bacteria (sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy) were pooled and examined by random-effects models. Results: Fifteen studies containing 18,966 samples were included. Pooled sensitivities were 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.91) for WBCs and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93-0.94) for bacteria. Corresponding pooled specificities were 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65-0.67) for WBCs and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.55-0.57) for bacteria. Areas under the summary receiver operating characteristics curves were 0.92 and 0.93 for WBCs and bacteria, respectively. The major limitation of eligible studies was that enrolled subjects were often not representative of clinical patient populations in which UTI would be suspected. Conclusions: WBC and bacterial measurements by the UF-100 and UF-1000i are useful indicators in UTI screening; however, the performances of these systems should be rigorously evaluated by additional studies. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V."

For example, the pooled frequency of urine leakage ranged from 10.6% (95% CI, 2.4% to 17.7%) in short-term catheterization cohorts to 52.1% (CI, 28.6% to 69.5%) among outpatients with long-term indwelling catheters. Serious complications were also noted, including urethral strictures, which occurred in 3.4% (CI, 1.0% to 7.0%) of patients with short-term catheterization. For patients with SCI, 13.5% (CI, 3.4% to 21.9%) had gross hematuria and 1.0% (CI, 0.0% to 5.0%) developed bladder cancer. Limitations: Although heterogeneity existed across studies for several outcomes, most could be accounted for by differences between studies with respect to quality and sex composition. Evidence published after 30 July 2012 is not included. Conclusion: Many noninfectious catheter-associated complications are at least as common as clinically significant urinary tract infections. ? 2013 American College of Physicians."

As the majority of these analyses have focused on appendicectomy in adults, our aim was to review the evidence base for pediatric patients. Subjects and Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of relevant studies published between 1990 and 2012. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify studies that investigated the incidence of IAA following LA and OA in pediatric patients. The primary outcome measure in the present meta-analysis was IAA formation, and secondary outcomes included wound infection (WI) and incidence of postoperative small bowel obstruction (SBO). Results: Sixty-six studies with a total of 22,060 pediatric patients were included: 56.5% OA and 43.5% LA. There was no overall difference in the incidence of IAA formation: 2.7% for OA (333/12,460) versus 2.9% for LA (282/9600) (P=.25). However, OA patients had a higher incidence of wound infection: 3.7% for OA (337/9228) versus 2.2% for LA (183/8154) (P<.001). Moreover, the incidence of SBO was lower in patients undergoing LA: 0.4% LA (86/5767) versus 1.5% (29/6840) (P<.001). Conclusions: The IAA incidence is comparable in LA versus OA in pediatric patients. LA confers a significantly lower risk of other postoperative complications, including WI and SBO. ?

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of HPV persistence patterns worldwide. Medline and ISI Web of Science were searched through January 1, 2010 for articles estimating HPV persistence or duration of detection. Descriptive and meta-regression techniques were used to summarize variability and the influence of study definitions and characteristics on duration and persistence of cervical HPV infections in women. Among 86 studies providing data on over 100,000 women, 73% defined persistence as HPV positivity at a minimum of two time points. Persistence varied notably across studies and was largely mediated by study region and HPV type, with HPV-16, 31, 33 and 52 being most persistent. Weighted median duration of any-HPV detection was 9.8 months. HR-HPV (9.3 months) persisted longer than low-risk HPV (8.4 months), and HPV-16 (12.4 months) persisted longer than HPV-18 (9.8 months). Among populations of HPV-positive women with normal cytology, the median duration of any-HPV detection was 11.5 and HR-HPV detection was 10.9 months. In conclusion, we estimated that approximately half of HPV infections persist past 6 to 12 months. Repeat HPV testing at 12-month intervals could identify women at increased risk of high-grade cervical precancer due to persistent HPV infections. Copyright ? 2012 UICC."

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials investigating the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron therapy. Data sources Randomised controlled trials from Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from 1966 to June 2013, with no language restrictions. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials of intravenous iron compared with either no iron or oral iron. Crossover and observational studies were excluded. Main outcome measures Change in haemoglobin concentration and risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion (efficacy) and risk of infection (safety). Results Of the 75 trials meeting the inclusion criteria, 72 studies including 10 605 patients provided quantitative outcome data for meta-analysis. Intravenous iron was associated with an increase in haemoglobin concentration (standardised mean difference 6.5 g/L, 95% confidence interval 5.1 g/L to 7.9 g/L) and a reduced risk of requirement for red blood cell transfusion (risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.88), especially when intravenous iron was used with erythroid stimulating agents (ESAs) or in patients with a lower baseline plasma ferritin concentration. There were no significant interactions between the efficacy of intravenous iron and type or dose administered. Intravenous iron was, however, associated with a significant increase in risk of infection (relative risk 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.64) compared with oral or no iron supplementation. The results remained similar when only high quality trials were analysed. Conclusions Intravenous iron therapy is effective in increasing haemoglobin concentration and reducing the risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion and could have broad applicability to a range of acute care settings. This potential benefit is counterbalanced by a potential increased risk of infection."

The level of evidence was very low for all other risk factors. Some well accepted risk factors such as pregnancy and belonging to an ethnic minority group could not be identified as risk factors. In contrast, women who were less than four weeks post partum had a significantly increased risk of death from pandemic influenza (4.43, 1.24 to 15.81). Conclusion The level of evidence to support risk factors for influenza related complications is low and some well accepted risk factors, including pregnancy and ethnicity, could not be confirmed as risks.

A systematic review of comparative studies using procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy in patients with infections was performed. METHODS: Randomized, controlled trials comparing procalcitonin-guided initiation, intensification, or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy to clinically guided therapy were included. Outcomes were antibiotic usage, morbidity, and mortality. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the National Guideline Clearinghouse, and the Health Technology Assessment Programme were searched from January 1, 1990 to December 16, 2011. RESULTS: Eighteen randomized, controlled trials were included. Data were pooled into clinically similar patient populations. In adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients, procalcitonin-guided discontinuation of antibiotics reduced antibiotic duration by 2.05 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.59 to -1.52) without increasing morbidity or mortality. In contrast, procalcitonin-guided intensification of antibiotics in adult ICU patients increased antibiotic usage and morbidity. In adult patients with respiratory tract infections, procalcitonin guidance significantly reduced antibiotic duration by 2.35 days (95% CI: -4.38 to -0.33), antibiotic prescription rate by 22% (95% CI: -41% to -4%), and total antibiotic exposure without affecting morbidity or mortality. A single, good quality study of neonates with suspected sepsis demonstrated reduced antibiotic duration by 22.4 hours (P=0.012) and reduced the proportion of neonates on antibiotics for ?72 hours by 27% (P=0.002) with procalcitonin guidance.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ST in Korea by performing a meta-analysis. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search on the efficacy of ST as a first-line therapy. The odds ratios (ORs) of eradicating H. pylori infection after ST compared with TT were pooled. Pooled estimates of the eradication rates of ST and TT were also calculated. Results: A total of six studies provided data on 1,759 adult patients. The ORs for the intention to treat (ITT) and the per-protocol (PP) eradication rate were 1.761 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.403 to 2.209) and 1.966 (95% CI, 1.489 to 2.595).

Most evaluations of antimicrobial risk factors have been conducted in healthcare settings. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between antibiotic exposure and community-associated CDI (CA-CDI) (i.e. symptom onset in the community with no healthcare facility admission within 12 weeks) and to determine the classes of antibiotics posing the greatest risk. Methods: We searched four electronic databases for subject headings and text words related to CA-CDI and antibiotics. Studies that investigated the risk of CA-CDI associated with antibiotic usage were considered eligible. Data from the identified studies were combined using a random-effects model and ORs were calculated. Results: Of 910 citations identified, eight studies (n 1/4 30184 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Antibiotic exposure was associated with an increased risk of CA-CDI (OR 6.91, 95% CI 4.17-11.44, I2 = 95%). The riskwas greatest with clindamycin (OR 20.43, 95% CI 8.50-49.09) followed by fluoroquinolones (OR 5.65, 95% CI 4.38-7.28), cephalosporins (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.60-12.50), penicillins (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.89-5.57), macrolides (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.91-3.39) and sulphonamides/trimethoprim (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.48-2.29).

Compared with glycopeptide antibiotics, linezolid achieves higher lung epithelial lining fluid concentrations, which may have an advantage in treating nosocomial pneumonia patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linezolid versus vancomycin or teicoplanin for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. Data were obtained from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases. Randomised controlled studies involving the use of linezolid versus vancomycin or teicoplanin in nosocomial pneumonia patients were included in the study. Twelve linezolid trials were included. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia regarding the clinical cure rate [relative risk (RR) = 1.08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.17, p = 0.06]. Linezolid was associated with better microbiological eradication rate in nosocomial pneumonia patients compared with glycopeptide antibiotics (RR = 1.16, 95 % CI = 1.03-1.31, p = 0.01).

It can be prevented and treated through drug regimen. However, drugs have serious adverse effects sometimes. The purpose of this review is to determine the most effective therapy for TE in HIV-infected patients. Different primary prophylaxis and treatment regimens have been compared with regard to episodes of TE, clinical response, morbidity, and serious adverse events. In September 2012, we searched PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) database for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any drug regimen for primary prophylaxis and treatment of TE in HIV-infected patients. We independently extracted data and assessed eligibility and risk of bias using a standardized data collection form, and resolved any disagreement through discussion. We combined dichotomous outcomes using odds ratio (OR), presenting with 95% confidence interval (CI). Eleven trials were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Six trials compared trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) with dapsone-pyrimethamine (D-P) were analyzed together for the outcome of episodes of TE, morbidity, and serious adverse events. The two treatment arms did not differ for episodes of TE (OR=0.98; 95% CI: 0.48-2.00). Compared with D-P, TMP-SMX showed a beneficial trend in terms of mortality despite a lack of statistical significance (OR=0.75; 95% CI: 0.53-1.06). However, TMP-SMX is still associated with substantial toxicity and intolerance (OR=1.47; 95% CI: 0.91-2.38). Three trials compared pyrimethamine-sulfadiazine (P-S) with pyrimethamine-clindamycin (P-C) were analyzed together for the outcome of clinical response, morbidity, and serious adverse events. Compared with P-C, P-S showed a beneficial trend in terms of clinical response (OR=1.63; 95% CI: 1.05-2.51); P-S also showed a beneficial trend in terms of mortality despite a lack of statistical significance (OR=0.66; 95% CI: 0.37-1.17). However, P-S is still associated with substantial toxicity and intolerance (OR=3.08; 95% CI: 1.82-5.24). Two trials compared P-S with TMP-SMX were analyzed together for the outcome of clinical response, morbidity, and serious adverse events. The two treatment arms did not differ for clinical response (OR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.39-2.06).

However, P-S is still associated with substantial toxicity and intolerance (OR=2.91; 95% CI: 0.99-8.55). The available evidence fails to identify any one superior regimen for the primary prophylaxis and treatment of TE. The choice of therapy will often be directed by available therapy.

However, no consensus has been reached on the optimal management of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). METHODS: In this metaanalysis, the diagnostic accuracy of nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) detection of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of 5 hrHPV types (the PreTect HPV-Proofer and NucliSENS EasyQ tests) for detecting grade 2 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse (CIN21) and CIN31 was assessed in women who had a diagnosis of ASC-US and LSIL. The results were compared with the Hybrid Capture-2 (HC2) assay, which detects the DNA of 13 hrHPV types. A bivariate random-effect model that incorporated the intrinsic correlation between the true-positive and false-positive rates was used for a pooled meta-analysis. RESULTS: Considering underlying CIN21, the pooled absolute sensitivity of the 10 included studies was 75.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.1%-82.7%) and 76.2% (95% CI, 68.3%-76.9%) for the triage of ASC-US and LSIL, respectively. The pooled absolute specificity to exclude CIN21 was 77.9% (95% CI, 70.1%-85.7%) and 74.2% (95% CI, 69.5%-78.8%) in women with ASC-US and LSIL, respectively. Five studies allowed direct comparison of the mRNA assays with HC2. Considering CIN21 in women with ASC-US and LSIL, mRNA testing was substantially more specific than the HC2 assay (ratio: 1.98 and 3.36, respectively; P<.001) but was less sensitive (ratio: 0.80 and 0.74, respectively; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: HPV assays for detecting the mRNA of 5 hrHPV types may reduce the over-diagnosis of women who have minor cytologic abnormalities. However, given the lower sensitivity, women with negative mRNA test results cannot be considered free of CIN21 and require further surveillance. ? 2013 American Cancer Society."

Different authors however have reached different conclusions about the prevalence of DVT in these patients and for the need for compression ultrasound (CUS). The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of DVT in patients with cellulitis and erysipelas, and inform the utility of CUS. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted of Medline and Cochrane for studies that reported groups of patients with cellulitis or erysipelas who had CUS to evaluate for DVT. Study quality assessment was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for Cohort Studies. The incidence rates from the included studies were pooled using a random-effects model to calculate an overall DVT rate. Individual and pooled DVT rates with corresponding upper and lower limits were graphed as a forest plot. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using the I2 statistic. Results Nine studies were included totaling 1054 patients with cellulitis or erysipelas with 18 DVTs. The overall pooled incidence rate was 2.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.5%-9.1%) for proximal DVT and 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 1.9%-4.9%) for any DVT. When analyzed separately, the pooled incidence rate for the three retrospective studies was 1.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.2%), while the rate for the six prospective studies was 7.8% (95% CI, 4.2%-14.2%). Conclusion The risk of DVT in cellulitis and erysipelas is low compared to the average risk of patients referred for CUS and comparable to low risk patients as determined by the commonly employed Wells criteria. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Cohort analysis with robust Poisson regression models and random-effects meta-analysis similarly suggested that linezolid use significantly increased the probability (95% confidence interval) of favorable outcome by 57% (10% to 124%) and 55% (10% to 121%), respectively. Defining significant associations by risk ratios>1.2 or<0.9, neither cohort analysis nor meta-analysis demonstrated any significant add-on benefit from the use of other group 5 drugs with respect to outcome for patients treated with linezolid, although selection bias might have led to underestimation of their effects. Our findings substantiated the use of linezolid in the treatment of XDR-TB or fluoroquinolone-resistant MDR-TB and call for further studies to evaluate the roles of other group 5 drugs.

The summary difference of standardized mean differences (SMD) between both study arms or between pre- and post-intervention assessments were defined as the effect size (ES); ES was calculated using standard meta-analysis in random effects models.Results:Thirty-four eligible studies were included in the analysis, including two randomized clinical trials (RCT), six quasi-experimental studies, six pre-and-post intervention studies, and twenty serial cross-sectional intervention studies. These studies showed an increase in consistent condom use with any male sexual partners (mean ES, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.56), with regular sexual partners (mean ES, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18-0.63), and casual sexual partners (mean ES, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.24-0.79). The analysis of ten studies that measured the impact on uptake of HIV testing also showed a positive result (mean ES, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38-0.71). The risk reduction interventions also improved HIV/AIDS-related knowledge (mean ES, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.94) and attitudes (mean ES, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.91-1.79), but did not reduce prevalence of HIV (mean ES, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.02-0.45) and syphilis infections (mean ES, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.19-0.17). There was significant heterogeneity among these studies.Conclusions:On aggregate, HIV risk reduction interventions were effective in reducing risky behaviors and improving knowledge and attitudes among Chinese MSM, but were not associated with a change in the prevalence of HIV and syphilis. Future studies should use incidence as definitive study outcome. ? 2013 Lu et al."

We systematically evaluated published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy and safety of CD versus fixed-dose MMF for kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: The electronic databases Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library (up to June 2012) were searched to identify relevant RCTs. Two reviewers independently applied the study selection criteria, examined the study quality, and extracted the data. Dichotomous measures were expressed as relative risk (RR) and continuous outcomes were expressed as weighted mean difference, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.1.6. RESULTS: Four RCTs met our selection criteria and included 1755 de novo recipients. The differences between CD and fixed-dose MMF in treatment failure (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82-1.10; P=0.52), serum creatinine clearance (weighted mean difference, 2.46; 95% CI, -1.15 to 6.07; P=0.18), total gastrointestinal adverse events (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.65-2.35; P=0.53), diarrhea (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.25; P=0.35), anemia (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.95-1.64; P=0.12), leukopenia (RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.93-1.35; P=0.25), thrombocytopenia (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.47-1.36; P=0.41), and malignancy (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.27-1.38; P=0.23) were not statistically significant. Furthermore, total infections were more frequent in the CD group (36.0% vs. 30.9%; RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.03-1.30; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence, CD MMF administration cannot be recommended as routine practice for kidney transplant recipients.

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in adults with type 2 diabetes. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from inception through April 2013 without language restrictions; regulatory authorities' reports; and gray literature. Study Selection: Randomized trials comparing SGLT2 inhibitors with placebo or other medication for type 2 diabetes. Data Extraction: Three reviewers extracted or checked data for study characteristics, outcomes of interest, and risk of bias, and 3 reviewers summarized strength of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Data Synthesis: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were compared with placebo in 45 studies (n=11 232) and with active comparators in 13 studies (n=5175). They had a favorable effect on hemoglobin A1c level (mean difference vs. placebo, -0.66% [95% CI, -0.73% to -0.58%]; mean difference vs. active comparators, -0.06% [CI, -0.18% to 0.05%]). Sensitivity analyses incorporating unpublished data showed similar effect estimates. Compared with other agents, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced body weight (mean difference, -1.80 kg [CI, -3.50 to -0.11 kg]) and systolic blood pressure (mean difference, -4.45 mm Hg [CI, -5.73 to -3.18 mm Hg]). Urinary and genital tract infections were more common with SGLT2 inhibitors (odds ratios, 1.42 [CI, 1.06 to 1.90] and 5.06 [CI, 3.44 to 7.45], respectively). Hypoglycemic risk was similar to that of other agents. Results for cardiovascular outcomes and death were inconclusive. An imbalance in incidence of bladder and breast cancer was noted with dapagliflozin compared with control. Limitation: Most trials were rated as high risk of bias because of missing data and last-observation-carried-forward methods. Conclusion: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors may improve short-term outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes, but effects on long-term outcomes and safety are unclear. ? 2013 American College of Physicians."

To assess the effects of bariatric surgery versus medical therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods. The Cochrane library, PubMed, Embase, Chinese biomedical literature database, and Wanfang database up to February 2012 were searched. The literature searches strategies contained terms (""diabetes"", ""surg"", and ""medic"" were used), combined with the medical subject headings. Randomized controlled trails (RCTs) of frequently used bariatric surgery for obese patients with type 2 diabetes were included. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. Results. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 170 patients in the bariatric surgery groups and 100 patients in the medical therapy group were selected. Compared with medical therapy, bariatric surgery for type 2 diabetes can significantly decrease the levels of HbA1c, FBG, weight, triglycerides, and the dose of hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medicine, while increasing the rate of diabetes remission (RR = 9.74, 95%CI, (1.36, 69.66)) and the levels of high-density lipoprotein. However, there are no statistical differences in serious adverse events between the surgical and medical groups (RR = 1.23, 95%CI, (0.80, 1.87)). Conclusions. Surgical procedures were more likely to help patients achieve benefits than medical therapy alone. Further intensive RCTs of high-quality, multiple centers and long-term followup should be carried out to provide more reliable evidence. ? 2013 Xiaohu Guo et al."

This indication is off-label, because it is not licensed by regulatory authorities. Recently ESAs were suspected to harm critically ill patients. Our objective was to assess the safety of ESAs in off-label indications in critically ill patients. Methods: Eleven databases were searched up to April 2012. We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled observational studies in any language that compared off-label ESAs treatment with other effective interventions, placebo or no treatment in critically ill patients. Two authors independently screened and evaluated retrieved records, extracted data and assessed risk of bias and quality of reporting. Results: We used frequentist and Bayesian models to combine studies, and performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses. From 12,888 citations, we included 48 studies (34 RCTs; 14 observational), involving 944,856 participants. Harm reporting was of medium to low quality. There was no statistically significant increased risk of adverse events in general, serious adverse events, the most frequently reported adverse events, and death in critically ill patients treated with ESAs. These results were robust against risk of bias and analysis methods. There is evidence that ESAs increase the risk of clinically relevant thrombotic vascular events, and there is some less certain evidence that ESAs might increase the risk for venous thromboembolism. Conclusions: In critically ill patients, administration of ESAs is associated with a significant increase in clinically relevant thrombotic vascular events but not with other frequently reported adverse events and death. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and ESICM."

Methods: We performed a comprehensive search of abstracts in the MEDLINE database, OVID database, Springer database, the Science Citation Index, and the Cochrane Library database. Published data of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the clinically relevant outcomes of early EN and other nutritional routes for patients after PD were analyzed. The analyzed outcome variables included gastroparesis, intra-abdominal complications (gastroparesis excluded), mortality, infection, and postoperative hospital stay. The Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.1 software was used for statistical analysis. Results: Four RCTs published in 2000 or later were included in this meta-analysis, in which 246 patients underwent early EN and 238 patients underwent other nutritional routes following PD. In the combined results of early EN versus other nutritional routes, no significant difference could be found in gastroparesis (odds ratio (OR), 0.89; 95 % CI, 0.36-2.18; P = 0.79), intra-abdominal complications (gastroparesis excluded) (OR, 0.82; 95 % CI, 0.53-1.26; P = 0.37), mortality (OR, 0.43; 95 % CI, 0.11-1.62; P = 0.21), infection (OR, 0.55; 95 % CI, 0.29-1.07; P = 0.08), postoperative hospital stay (mean difference, -0.93; 95 % CI, -6.51 to 4.65; P = 0.74).

However, no published studies have combined systematic review and meta-analysis of existing evidence. PURPOSE: To quantify the link between RSV hospitalization in early life and subsequent diagnosis of asthma. METHOD: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they assessed the association between RSV-confirmed hospitalization for up to 3 years of age and asthma/wheezing later in life. Potential sources of heterogeneity were identified by stratified analysis. RESULTS: Twenty articles representing 15 unique studies of 82,008 unique individuals (including 1533 with RSV-confirmed hospitalization) were selected for meta-analysis. Children who had RSV disease in early life had a higher incidence of asthma/wheezing in later life (odds ratio: 3.84; 95% confidence interval: 3.23-4.58). There was moderate heterogeneity between studies (I = 45%). The association was found to decrease with age at follow-up, consistent with the findings of longitudinal studies. When age at follow-up was considered, heterogeneity was low (residual I = 17%). LIMITATIONS: Study quality was generally poor because randomization to hospitalization for RSV infection was not possible, appropriate blinding was rare and adjustment for confounding variables was not always appropriate. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis suggests an association between infant RSV hospitalization and respiratory morbidity that decreases with age. If the association is causal, the development of an effective vaccine against RSV could decrease the burden of asthma. Copyright ? 2013 Lippincott Williams &Wilkins."

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate surgical outcomes following early oral feeding compared with traditional oral feeding in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify randomized clinical trials comparing the outcomes following early oral feeding versus traditional oral feeding in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. The trials must have reported at least one of the following end points: anastomotic dehiscence, pneumonia, wound infection, nasogastric tube reinsertion, vomiting, mortality, length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and quality of life. Results: Seven trials, which included a total of 587 patients, met our inclusion criteria. Compared with traditional oral feeding, early oral feeding reduced the length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference -1.58 days; 95% CI -2.77 to -0.39; p = 0.009) and the total postoperative complications (relative risk 0.70; 95% CI 0.50-0.98; p = 0.04).

A recent variation on primary linear closure (PLC) is purse-string approximation (PSA), where the skin is approximated via a purse-string suture but not closed. The optimal technique remains to be determined. The objective of this review was to compare outcomes with PLC versus PSA for skin closure following stoma reversal. Methods: A literature search of Embase and Medline was performed to identify studies comparing PLC with PSA published between 1966 and 2012. Reviews of each study were conducted and data extracted. Random-effects methods were used to combine data, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed. Results: Six out of 47 identified studies met the inclusion criteria: 2 randomized controlled trials and 4 case controlled series. For the primary outcome of SSI rate, 233 patients in the PLC and 170 patients in the PSA group were available for comparison. PSA resulted in a reduced rate of SSI (2.4 % PSA vs. 29.6 % PLC; OR 0.083, 95 % CI = 0.03-0.21, p < 0.001). No differences were noted in length of hospital stay. Three studies assessed self-reported cosmetic results at a minimum of 7 months post-operatively. Patients who underwent PSA reported greater satisfaction with the cosmetic outcome (Standard mean difference = 0.47 on ten-point scale, 95 % CI 0.15-0.79, p = 0.005). Conclusions: Purse-string approximation of stoma wounds is associated with an 80 % reduction in SSI with no negative effect on length of hospital stay or long-term cosmetic outcome. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Italia."

This study investigated whether prophylactic mesh reinforcement of laparotomy reduced the rate of incisional hernia, with emphasis on trial design and quality. Methods: A systematic review of published literature was performed for studies comparing incisional hernia presence following conventional closure or prophylactic mesh reinforcement. Studies were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the Jadad score and the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). The primary endpoint was incisional hernia, assessed by meta-analysis. Results: Seven studies [four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three prospective trials] included 588 patients; 262 received mesh reinforcement. All studies included elective patients at high risk of incisional hernia. Six incorporated a polypropylene mesh and one a biologic mesh. Four studies were judged high quality by NOS and two of four RCTs were at low risk of bias, although overall outcome assessment from all studies was either poor or mediocre. Mesh significantly reduced the rate of incisional hernia [odds ratio (OR) 0.15, p &lt; 0.001]; the same effect was seen in RCTs only (OR 0.17, p &lt; 0.001). A borderline increase of seroma seen with a fixed effect model (OR 1.82, p = 0.050) was not seen with a random effect model (OR 1.86, p = 0.210, I 2 = 45 %). Conclusion: Mesh reinforcement of laparotomy significantly reduced the rate of incisional hernia in high-risk patients. However, poor assessment of secondary outcomes limits applicability; routine placement in all patients cannot yet be recommended.

Methods: All of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on FTS for colorectal surgery were analyzed with the Cochrane systematic review. Database retrievals of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was were conducted, together with two published FTS meta-analyses. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the studies, extracted the relevant data and performed a cross-check. A metaanalysis was performed with RevMan 5 software. Results: A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this study, including 13 articles in English and 2 articles in Chinese, of which 7 were RCTs and 8 were CCTs. The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were lower compared to patients who underwent the conventional treatments (conventional treatment group or control group) in the RCTs but tended to increase in the CCTs. There were no statistically significant differences between the FTS group and the control group regarding ileus, anastomotic leakage, abdominal distention, nausea and vomiting, urinary retention and infection of the incisional wound. Conclusion: The overall rates of morbidity and readmission in the FTS group were similar or even lower compared to the control group in RCTs, with an increasing trend in the CCTs. Further discussion is needed as to why the results of the RCTs were not repeated in the CCTs, especially with regard to the causes of readmission. It should also be determined whether an early discharge might cause a delay in the diagnosis of some complications, and thereby the occurrence of serious complications. If a number of severe complications occurred due to an early discharge, the value of FTS would be in question. ? 2012 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

A new potential therapeutic strategy, denosumab, is being investigated in a variety of tumors. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of denosumab in comparison with ZA in patients with bone metastases secondary to malignancy. METHODS: A systematic literature search of several electronic databases till July 2011 and a review of reference lists of relevant articles was conducted. Summary relative estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a fixed-effects or random-effects model, depending on the heterogeneity of the included studies. RESULTS: Seven reports from 3 randomized controlled trials involving 5723 patients were identified. The pooled analysis showed that denosumab significantly delayed time to first on-study skeletal-related event [hazard ratio (HR)=0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90, P<0.001], time to multiple skeletal-related events (HR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90, P<0.001), and pain worsening (HR=0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99, P=0.026) for patients with bone metastases compared with ZA. Similar results of the 2 groups were obtained with respect to overall survival (HR=0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06), disease progression (HR=1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.09), and pain improvement. Summary of the adverse effects revealed similar safety profiles for the 2 drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is superior to ZA in preventing complications for patients with bone metastases. However, further studies are still needed to assess longer-term safety and efficacy of denosumab. Copyright ? 2012 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins."
